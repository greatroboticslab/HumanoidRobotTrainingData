If we interpret that as tasks a farmer would do in terms of the farming activities mentioned in the video, which is land preparation. Therefore, the main task could be \"Carry out land preparation and clearing,\" with subtasks the various steps. But the problem is that without specific actions, maybe it's challenging.",
