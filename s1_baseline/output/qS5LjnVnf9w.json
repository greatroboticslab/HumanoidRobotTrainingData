                "Listen to the webinar introduction and greetings.",
                "Understand the role of the trainer, Chris Warwick, in managing GRDC's grain storage extension project.",
                "Note the Q&A process for asking questions during the webinar.",
                "Recognize the agricultural organization facilitating the session (BCG).",
                "Grasp the overall importance of hygiene and structural treatments in grain storage.",
                "Identify the key components of the grain storage system overview.",
                "Comprehend the significance of prevention as a primary method in pest control.",
                "Acknowledge the fast reproduction rate of grain pests within three months.",
                "Relate the research on the number of eggs, larvae, and pupae produced by adult insects.",
                "Understand the preference of pests for shelter and food sources.",
                "Note specific areas around the farm prone to insect habitation (e.g., seed silos, chook feed, machinery with residue, overturned hoppers, hay/grass).",
                "Consider silo design for easy cleaning (smooth concrete pad).",
                "Comprehend the importance of timely cleaning in the cool months before temperature rises.",
                "Recognize the use of diatomaceous earth (DE) as a chemical-free pest control method.",
                "Learn the application process and timing of DE in grain storage (5-10 days kill time, 65% relative humidity effectiveness).",
                "Understand alternative applications of structural treatments for machinery and outdoor areas.",
                "Note the potential risks and considerations when using DE in silos (e.g., avoiding mixing with pulses or oilseeds).",
                "Identify personal protective equipment needed when applying DE (dust mask, gloves, goggles).",
                "Engage with the Q&A process by formulating and submitting relevant questions through the designated window.",
                "Acknowledge the plan for a follow-up webinar on upgrading storage and the option to provide feedback via a survey email.",
                "Prepare to implement learned strategies for hygiene and structural treatments in their own grain storage practices."
