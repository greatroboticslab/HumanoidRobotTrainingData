                "Understanding the timing of cleaning operations, preferably during cooler months when pest activity is minimized to prevent immediate infestation post-cleaning.",
                "Preparing grain storage facilities with diatomaceous earth treatments approximately 5-10 days before harvest to prevent pest resurgence, particularly for high-value commodities like pulses and oilseeds.",
                "Using appropriate personal protective equipment (dust mask, gloves, goggles) when handling diatomaceous earth due to its abrasive nature and potential eye irritation."
