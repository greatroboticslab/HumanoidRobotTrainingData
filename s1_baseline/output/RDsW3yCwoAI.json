Subtasks include understanding the symbiotic relationship (nitrogen fixation by beans and weed suppression by squash) and practicing sustainable farming techniques like crop rotation. The tasks are general physical actions related to the video's content. Answer shown in Scratch format with MAINTASKs and SUBTASKs. The transcript is relevant to farming and agriculture, focusing on traditional farming methods. Answer begins and ends with triple backticks for Markdown formatting. Spreadsheet-style formatting is not necessary here. All components and steps are included."
