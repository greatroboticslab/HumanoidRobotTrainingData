                "Water the tray directly, maintaining two to three inches of water until absorbed, avoiding overwatering.",
                "Use a grow light to provide adequate sunlight for seed germination.",
                "Monitor seedling growth and thin to one plant per cup when two leaves appear.",
                "After four weeks, reduce soil level to the rim, trim leaves below the rim, and replant with potting soil to promote root growth.",
                "Water as needed and transition plants to a sunny area or greenhouse, preparing for outdoor planting.",
                "Harden off plants for two weeks before transplanting into the garden."
