But since the transcript just says \"Look at those nice healthy roots\" after they start making a stir fry, so maybe that sentence is about the roots being in good condition and the speaker checking them. So perhaps this is a separate action. But I might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps performing the maintenance action, but given that \"Look at those nice healthy roots\" is part of the transcript, you have to include that as a task. Maybe part of the harvesting, but the transcript says \"Look at those nice healthy roots. All right, let's go make a stir fry with this.\" So upon harvesting the bok choy, the speaker then looks at the roots to see if they are healthy, then proceeds to make stir fry. So maybe it's part of the harvesting task.",

If it's a dedicated harvest, then probably just the MAINTASKs listed above. Let me check. The transcript says \"We're going to harvest some beautiful bok choy from the tower garden.\" So the main task is to harvest the bok choy. The tools used here might include hands, maybe gloves if needed. Then perhaps later a cutting tool if the bok choy is too tough. But in the transcript, it's just mentioned \"pull out\" which would suggest pulling by the stem. Since roots are mentioned, but if the tower garden is a hydroponic system, the roots would be in the tower. So maybe the main steps are:",
