Subtasks: Checking the field at regular intervals to assess the stage of growth (e.g., V1, V2, V3 for seedling stages; tasseling, etc.), compare with expected timelines, and adjust management practices as needed. However, given the transcript mentions specific numbers, these might correspond to the V series, such as variety 48 days to V8, etc. But without exact details, it's challenging to map them. Alternatively, the 48 could be days to emergence, 40 days to silking, etc. Since the transcript numbers follow the seed variety, perhaps. If that's the case, it's reasonable to assume these tasks include monitoring according to the variety's specific growth stages.",
