            "task": "choosing the variety. Then, selecting the right spot. Tomatoes need at least 6-8 hours of sun, so that's another task: finding the sunniest part of the garden. Also, wind protection is important; they don't like strong winds. So protecting them from wind would be a task. Watering is key, especially during hot weather but not too much. Feeding them with fertilizer, that's another task. Preparing the soil\u2014soil needs to be well-draining; adding compost is mentioned. Maybe tilling the soil or mixing compost into it would be specific tasks. Then, actually planting the tomatoes: digging holes, putting them in, maybe staking them? The transcript didn't mention staking, but if you need to, that's a task. Deeper planting, as mentioned, where you bury some of the lower leaves. Spacing is important\u2014about 18 inches apart. Checking for weeds or pests\u2014does the transcript mention that? Yeah, it's important to monitor for pests and diseases, so that's a task. Then, regular watering and fertilizing. So those are the main tasks. Maybe each of those steps can be broken down further. For example, preparing the soil could include checking soil pH and adjusting it. Or adding other amendments like peat moss or manure. Each of these can be a sub-task. Watering might involve checking soil moisture regularly. Fertilizing could be applying in spring and midsummer. Maybe the tasks should be listed hierarchically. Let me think. First, the overall MAINTASK would be \"Planting tomatoes in a garden.\" Under that, we have subtasks like: choosing varieties, selecting location, wind protection, soil preparation, planting, fertilizing, watering, etc. Each of those sub-tasks can then be exploded into smaller steps. For example, choosing varieties could include researching compact varieties, or looking for determinate types. Selecting location might involve observing which areas get the most sun, or checking for other plants nearby that might cast shade. Wind protection sub-tasks could be identifying garden areas prone to wind gusts or setting up physical barriers. Soil preparation could include testing soil quality, adding amendments, mixing them in. Planting the tomato could have sub-tasks like measuring the distance between plants, making planting holes, placing the plant, covering the soil. Watering might include timing, checking soil moisture, using a watering can or hose. Fertilizing could be getting the right type of compost or fertilizer. I need to look for the exact steps given in the transcript to map them to the sub-tasks. Let's re-read the transcript to catch any other tasks. Here's the outline:",
