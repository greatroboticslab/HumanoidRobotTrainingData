            "task": "Following New Mexico State University guidelines on pesticide use in agriculture, a farmer undergoes various protective tasks to ensure safety while managing crop pests. Subtasks include determining the correct pesticide for specific pests, understanding label contents, adhering to application methods, and storing chemicals safely. Physical tasks required involve donning protective gear such as long clothing, gloves, goggles, and face shields. Application methods necessitate adherence to wind direction, timing, and environmental considerations to prevent drift and runoff. Post-application, proper disposal of containers and spill management are critical.",
            "subtasks": [
                "Identify the pest to target and select appropriate selective pesticide.",
                "Read the pesticide label to understand usage, brand, formulation, active ingredients, and toxicity.",
                "Wear protective clothing including long sleeves, pants, coveralls, neoprene gloves, goggles, and boots.",
                "Apply pesticides with equipment operating toward wind direction to prevent drift on the farmer.",
                "Avoid applying pesticides in moderate or strong winds to minimize drift.",
                "Store pesticides in original labeled containers in a cool, dry place, away from water, and secure them with a leak-proof plastic tub.",
                "Dispose of pesticide containers by washing them three times and either destroying or burying them after use, and manage spills by containing them with sawdust, soil, or a dike before disposing of the residue in a specialized landfill."
