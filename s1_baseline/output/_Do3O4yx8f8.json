The key message is about thinning seedlings to give them enough space and nutrients. Breaking this down, the primary action required is transplanting, which is a physical task involving handling plants. This led me to list specific subtasks under MAINTASK: Transplant young seedlings while ensuring proper spacing. This includes inspecting seedlings, identifying overgrown cells, removing excess plants, and monitoring the transplanted ones.",
