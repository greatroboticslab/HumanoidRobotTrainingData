Under that, standing the palette up to find a stable position and cutting cross rails are subtasks. Adding feet, mounting tools with supports, attaching shelves, inserting dowels, building multiple shelves, drilling dowels, mounting j-hooks and dirt breaker holders, hanging the ice scraper, adding a knee pad shelf\u2014all those would be separate subtasks. Then considering the finish options is another task. And the final MAINTASK of presenting the construction process with the website link.",
