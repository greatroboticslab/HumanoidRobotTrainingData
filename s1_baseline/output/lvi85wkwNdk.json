                "The transcript discusses various tasks related to growing small fruits such as strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries in pots using greenhouse and outdoor production methods. The key physical tasks a person would perform include operating greenhouse equipment to position plants in containers (MAINTASK: Operate a greenhouse equipment to grow small fruit in pots), watering plants with appropriate techniques, applying fertilizers or nutrients (SUBTASK: Water plants; SUBTASK: Apply fertilizers), monitoring plant health, and addressing root rot issues (SUBTASK: Monitor plant health). Additionally, the use of Mycorrhizal fungi and biofungicide to support plant roots and suppress pathogens is mentioned (SUBTASK: Supports plant roots with Mycorrhizal fungi; SUBTASK: Use biofungicide to suppress root pathogens). For preparation, selecting and mixing appropriate growing media (MAINTASK: Preparing growing media for small fruit production), including components like peat, perlite, and bark, and adding active ingredients is crucial (SUBTASK: Select appropriate growing media; SUBTASK: Mix growing media). Outdoor production involves preparing containers, transplanting plants, and monitoring water retention (MAINTASK: Fieldwork for outdoor production of small fruit). This aligns with the use of ProMix products mentioned in the transcript, which cater to different crop needs, container sizes, and cultural practices (MAINTASK: Choosing the right growing media and practices)."
