This includes tasks such as building or installing high-tunnels, preparing planting schedules, managing irrigation and fertilization, controlling pests and diseases, and harvesting crops. Additionally, tasks related to crop rotation, soil preparation, and adaptation to weather conditions are included. Finally, the mention of marketing and certification processes is noted as part of the agricultural tasks. Tasks are derived from the information provided, focusing on the physical actions rather than technical details. The final answer lists MAINTASK followed by subtasks, each detailing a physical task related to farming, agriculture, or operating farming equipment.",
