The main tasks include providing educational materials (MAINTASK), such as conducting surveys (subtask), analyzing dealer feedback (subtask), compiling real-world data (subtask), and developing objective marketing pieces (subtask). Educating customers through advertising (MAINTASK) and promoting the benefits of the new technologies is another key aspect (subtask). Additionally, extending warranties (MAINTASK) on new equipment can help ease customer concerns, though this may not be feasible without market pressure. Finally, enhancing dealer knowledge (MAINTASK) is crucial; they must be trained to understand competing products and present unbiased information (subtasks).",
