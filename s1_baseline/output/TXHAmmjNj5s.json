                "Zero the scale with the empty container, then reweigh it after collecting seed from the specified row units.",
                "Accurately measure the seed depth or spacing using a ruler for precise adjustment of seed release mechanisms.",
                "Adjust seed cups or other parameters as needed based on weight compared to the calibration target and ruler measurements.",
                "Repeat calibration steps on the opposite side or additional row units if necessary for thorough accuracy.",
                "Apply calibration results by fixing the settings with a magnetic sheet for future reference and adherence.",
                "Regularly verify drill calibration during field operations to maintain consistent planting precision."
