                "Gather necessary equipment (tape measure, ruler, calculator, scale, duct tape, cups, and a calibration magnet sheet).",
                "Consult the Rice Tech website for seed per pound rate and desired planting rate.",
                "Adjust grain drill transmission settings to the lowest drive setting and set the notch to the appropriate number (e.g., 60 for 8-inch drill models).",
                "Measure the circumference of the gauge wheel in inches and convert to feet.",
                "Using the Rice Tech calibration worksheet, compute the required pounds per acre based on seeds per pound and desired seeds per acre.",
                "For Great Plains and John Deere box drills, set the transmission to the lowest setting and adjust the clamp to the correct row spacing (e.g., 18 inches or 15 inches).",
                "Remove seed from the grain drill's seed cups and measure the number of seeds needed for calibration using the calculated pounds per acre.",
                "Use the seed cups or cups marked for catch, turn the gauge wheel 15 revolutions, zero out the scale, and measure the seed weight.",
                "Use a metal ruler to measure the number of teeth on the seed cup coil and adjust the metering lever accordingly for precise calibration (average 1.25 mm per tooth adjustment).",
                "Repeat the calibration process on the opposite side of the drill, using the ruler and metering lever to ensure even distribution.",
                "Record the final calibration settings on the magnet sheet and affix it to the drill for future reference.",
                "Regularly check calibration during field operations by monitoring seed distribution and adjusting as needed."
