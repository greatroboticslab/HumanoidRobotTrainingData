Additionally, the task of subscribing to the channel after the video is mentioned, which could be part of a viewer's engagement. The main task is MAINTASK: Cleaning a dirty cow, with several subtasks including preparing the environment, using water and brushes, and handling the duration of cleaning. The subscription action is more of a behavioral task rather than a physical one but aligns with post-content interaction. The video is relevant as it shows the process of a significant cleaning task and ends with a clear call to action.",
