The subtasks break down the physical actions necessary for each MAINTASK, considering the precision and high-tech nature of the required operations. For example, driving a precision farming tractor involves not only operating the vehicle but also adjusting settings based on data analytics, which might require some physical manipulation of controls and input devices. Similarly, setting up a hydroponic system is a physical task that includes drilling into walls (if a DWC setup like Big Bubble System is used), connecting plumbing, and maintaining the system's components over time. The combined list covers the major physical aspects of interacting with the described technologies in an agricultural setting. Therefore, despite the transcript's focus on technology, the generated tasks incorporate the necessary physical aspects involved in operating and optimizing these modern farming tools and techniques.",
