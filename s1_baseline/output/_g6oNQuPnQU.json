Then, after planting, subtasks would be checking to ensure no damage (making sure the tractor didn't cause any issues), which could relate to soil compaction or other physical damage. Then MAINTASK: Planting seeds: Subtasks include loading the planter with seeds (correctly loading, ensuring even distribution), positioning seeds in the soil (using the planter correctly, ensuring proper spacing and depth), ensuring correct planting depth (adjusting the planter settings), and then after planting, checking the rows to see if everything was done properly (looking for missed spots or overly deep seeds). Then the MAINTASK: Checking the tractor: Subtasks are inspecting for any issues (looking for any signs of wear or damage), greasing moving parts (maintaining lubrication), tightening loose nuts and bolts (to prevent loosening during operation), and replacing any worn parts (like belts, filters, etc.). Each of these seems like a key physical task a farmer would perform.",

Then MAINTASK: Planting seeds with subtasks of loading the planter, positioning seeds in the soil, ensuring correct depth, and then shortly after planting, a subtask of checking to ensure nothing got damaged. Then, MAINTASK: Checking the tractor with subtasks like inspecting for issues, greasing parts, tightening bolts, and replacing worn parts. That seems right. So these tasks are physical actions related to farming, as requested. So the transcript led me to list these tasks and subtasks. All relevant to the video.",
