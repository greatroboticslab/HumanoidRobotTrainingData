                "Time ripping and weed control activities a year in advance of planting",
                "Choose the optimal planting season (pre-break of the season in April or Autumn) for establishing trees",
                "Plan the structure of the shelter belt (e.g., five rows with small shrubs on the outside and larger trees in the center)",
                "Ensure proper placement of shelter belts perpendicular to prevailing winds to reduce wind speeds and erosion",
                "Consider permeability of the shelter belt to prevent wind tunnel effects",
                "Source and acquire plants from local nurseries or government programs (e.g., Brosserbush Gardens, free native plants)",
                "Prepare the soil by ripping to improve subsoil moisture and root development",
                "Install tree guards and stakes to protect young trees during establishment"
