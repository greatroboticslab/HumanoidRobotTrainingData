For example, the transcript doesn't say \"calibrate the fertilizer spreader.\" But since planting corn would involve applying fertilizer, even if it's not specifically mentioned, the application part can be inferred. Similarly, adjusting the drag chains is mentioned in the transcript. So yeah, drag chains adjustment would be a separate task."
