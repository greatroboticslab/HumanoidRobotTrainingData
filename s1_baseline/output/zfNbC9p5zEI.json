            "task": "cleaning teats, attaching the machine, operating the machine (the pulsation), and then collecting the milk. Then after milking, they feed calves. There's a mention of a specific calf, Gloria's red baby calf, who got extra attention. So maybe a subtask related to specialized calf care. Then once all chores are done, they start milking again at 4 p.m. So that's the routine. Daily twice a day. Morning and evening milking. So the tasks are pretty clear: early morning wake-up, milking, feed calves, do chores, repeat. The tasks should be structured as dairy farming related activities. Let me check if there's anything else. Oh, the milking setup: they can milk 12 cows at a time, 6 on each side. That might be part of describing the barn layout, but maybe relevant to know how they manage the cows. But perhaps the main task is milking, so the way it's done. The \"pulsate\" part is important because it's how the milk is extracted. They clean the teats first, so importantly, hygiene. Then, operator attaches the machine. The milk flows into whey jars (I wonder if that's a mistake? Shouldn't milk go directly into the bulk tank? Maybe \"whey jars\" is a mishearing, as milk and whey are separated after milking. Maybe just \"jars\" as a term? That might require clarification. But assuming that's the case, so the milk is collected in jars first, then transferred to the bulk tank. This could introduce a task of transferring milk from jars to the bulk tank. The bulk tank cools the milk. So chilling is another task. Then once cooled, it's ready to be picked up. Maybe the farm has a regular pick-up schedule. The farmer thanks the viewer for joining, so perhaps engaging with an audience is part of their duties? Not sure if that's physical though. Anyway, the main tasks would be the milking process, feeding calves, and general barn chores. The milking process is the biggest component. So I should start with the main task: Dairy farming daily routine. Then the subtasks would be under that. So let's start with the milking: Ensuring teats are clean before milking. Then, performing the milking with the machine, which includes placing the machine and letting it pulsate. The subsequent steps would be collecting the milk. But the confusion about whey jars might complicate that. Wait, maybe during milking, the milk is in the machine, then flows to the jars? If so, that's perhaps a mistake in the transcript, since milk from the cow goes through the machine and directly to the bulk tank. Then, the whey is separated later. If \"whey jars\" is a mishearing for \"milk jars,\" then perhaps it's a misnaming. However, given the transcript mentions whey, maybe it's separating milk into whey and curds or something, but that's not typical. Usually, after milking, the milk is cooled immediately. So maybe the \"whey jars\" are a step before cooling? Not sure. Let's go with the transcript as is. Maybe the process is that the milk flows from the teats into the machine's collection area, then into the jars, and then into the bulk tank. So steps might be: clean teats, attach machine, machine pulses, milk collected in jars (maybe this is a misnomer, actually, maybe they collect the milk in the machine's storage and then it goes to the bulk tank?), transfer to bulk tank. Hmm. This might need more accuracy. Let's parse the milking part again: \"milk will then flow into our whey jars, which will then flow into our bulk tank.\" If \"whey jars\" are actually collection containers before the bulk tank, that might make sense, but usually, after milking, the milk goes into the bulk tank right away. Maybe \"whey jars\" is a translation error? Wait, maybe in their system, the milk goes from the teat cups into a band of jars, then transferred to the bulk tank. Or perhaps they are using a bulk tank but don't have a separator, so they store the milk in jars temporarily. This is getting a bit confusing, but given the video transcript, we should note this as is. So if the subtasks include \"collect milk into whey jars,\" that's a step, followed by \"transfer to bulk tank.\" Alternatively, perhaps the \"whey jars\" are a type of container that is part of the milking machine, like a pre-chiller? Not sure. In most modern dairy farms, the milk is collected into the bulk tank via the machine directly. But without more research, maybe we can leave it as per the transcript: Teats cleaned, machine placed, machine pulses, milk flows into jars (maybe this is a misconception, but we have to go by the transcript), then transferred to bulk tank. The key steps then would be: Check teats, apply machine, machine operates, collect milk, chill in bulk tank. Then after milking, feeding calves. So that's two major tasks: milking and calf feeding. There is also mention of other chores. The person says, \"complete any chores needed to be done throughout the day.\" So maybe under milking, we can include general barn maintenance? Or perhaps \"performing daily milking duties\" which includes everything. Alternatively, it could be a separate task. Let's restructure: MAINTASK would be Dairy farming daily routine, with subtasks being Waking up early, meeting cows, milking process, feeding calves, and completing chores. Maybe that's the way to go. Let's confirm: The milking process has several steps. Each step is a subtask under milk production. Afterward, there's a separate task for feeding calves, and then the general chores. So structure like:",
