Specifically, \"In smaller farms, harvesting is done by hand, but for larger operations, specialized machines make the process quicker and more efficient.\" So for larger farms, the operator would need to run these machines. However, the topics might not go into how to operate the machines in detail. Maybe the machining operation is a given. But since the video is about the process, not necessarily the operation of each machine, only the use is mentioned. Therefore, perhaps there's a subtask under harvesting for using specialized machines, but the actual operation steps aren't detailed. Similarly, processing uses conveyors and sorters. The farmer would need to operate these, but the video doesn't go into how, just that they are used. So maybe a subtask like \"operate processing machines\" is part of MAINTASK Processing.",
