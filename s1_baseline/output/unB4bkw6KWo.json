Subtasks include explaining the economic reasons (SUBTASK 1), mentioning satellite map technology (SUBTASK 2), highlighting reduced use over 40 years (SUBTASK 3), noting increased food output (SUBTASK 4), and addressing skepticism (SUBTASK 5). Another MAINTASK covering the broader argument against criticisms includes emphasizing low fertilizer use due to economics (SUBTASK 6), satellite application (SUBTASK 7), significant reduction history (SUBTASK 8), efficiency gains (SUBTASK 9), and challenging critics' perceptions (SUBTASK 10). Tasks are relevant to agricultural practices, such as farming, husbandry, and equipment operation. The transcript is thus relevant (>>>ACCEPT) to agricultural discussions."
