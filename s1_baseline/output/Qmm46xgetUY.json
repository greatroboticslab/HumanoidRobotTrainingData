            "task": "Feeding and interacting with livestock, as walnuts are for the pigs), putting them in a wagon (another subtask). Moving the fence for the cows (another MAINTASK: Managing livestock movement) and building shelters for the pigs. They also mention the solar chargers for the electric fence (subtask of building shelters), and using bread as a lure for the pigs (another MAINTASK: Luring pigs with food). Setting up the fence with electric net and tarps, so that's MAINTASK: Building and setting up shelters. Then the whole process of getting the pig into the paddock seems like a MAINTASK: Relocating livestock. So all these main tasks are covered. The subtasks are specific actions within each main task. For example, under 'Feeding and interacting with livestock', subtasks include holding out hand for a friend, picking up walnuts, putting them in a wagon, feeding pigs, etc. The subtask of 'walking through the grass' for the pigs isn't explicitly mentioned, so maybe I should check if it's relevant but I think falling walnuts and pumpkins are mentioned as food. Trying to make sure the answer is perfect. I think the MAINTASKs here are accurate because they encompass the major activities. Each main task is a broad category, which can include the listed subtasks. The structure is logical. Starting with feeding and interaction, then moving on to managing movement, building shelters, luring pigs, and relocating them. Then the main skill would be farming and animal husbandry. That's a skill that combines all these tasks. So, the entire answer is acceptable as per the transcript's content, which is about farm life and activities. Perfect.",

            "task": "**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!** Wait, just one second. Let me read through the transcript again to see if I missed any tasks. Hmm, in the very beginning, Liam mentions making a friend, who jumped on his hand. Then he tried to let him go and the friend didn't want to leave. So that's an interaction with an animal (probably a goat or some jumping creature). Then they're picking up walnuts and putting them in a wagon. Observing the cows eating, which might be part of monitoring their health, but feeding them could be considered managing their movement. Then they're feeding the pigs pumpkins and walnuts. Interacting with baby Bowser, who\u2019s a pig. Then moving the fence for the cows (rotational grazing). Controlling a cow called Bill's attempts to leave. Helping with the pigs, like getting Peaches into the new paddock. Moving the fence for the Coonies (another group). Then they talk about building shelters for the pigs, like tarped areas and plans for winter. Using bread as a lure for the pigs and moving them that way. The main physical tasks I can see are all related to farm activities. For example, moving fencing materials, working with the pigs (luring, feeding), interacting with cows, setting up shelters. All operations in a farm setting, so answers related to agriculture and animal husbandry. Hence, the main skill is farming and animal husbandry. So, putting it all together like that makes sense. The answer is acceptable with the given MAINTASKs and subtasks.",
