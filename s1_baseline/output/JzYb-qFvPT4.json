Subtasks include setting up and troubleshooting the equipment (SUBTASK 1-2) and understanding how monitors control the tractor's functions (SUBTASK 3). For specialty crops like seed corn (MAINTASK), they adjust row shutoffs (SUBTASK 4) to manage costs (SUBTASK 5). The team specializes in seed corn (MAINTASK), ensuring efficient planting with minimal operator intervention (SUBTASKS 6-7)."
