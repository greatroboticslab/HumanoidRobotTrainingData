The speaker talks about the need to have proper drainage, so ensuring good drainage is part of field preparation? Maybe that's given in the first MAINTASK when they evaluate the different zones. Yeah, the well-drained areas are good, intermediate are struggling, wet areas failed. So selecting the right areas for reseeding is part of the decision, which is already in the MAINTASK of reseeding.",
