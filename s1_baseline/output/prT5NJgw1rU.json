Breaking it down into MAINTASK (main task) and SUBTASKs (sub tasks) as per the instructions. The final answer consists of the MAINTasks (capitalized as per the instructions) followed by a list of Subtasks for each, each prefixed with SUBTASK:. This structure should fulfill the requirements. Apologize for the lengthy response; the task involved carefully analyzing the transcript and translating the described agricultural practices into required physical tasks that someone would perform on the farm."
