Similarly, entering the cab is necessary before operating any machine but is listed as a subtask under each specific piece of equipment. The tasks are grouped by the primary piece of equipment being operated, such as the combine, ballast truck, trailer, etc. To maintain separation from the user's initial instruction, I have not listed \"physical tasks\" but instead use the terms \"MAINTASK\" and \"SUBTASK\" as per the guidelines. Tasks related to farm management, such as inventory, were excluded unless they involved physical actions. With the inclusion of the revised format and grouping, the final answer provides a general structure of the main tasks and their underlying subtasks as per the transcript."
