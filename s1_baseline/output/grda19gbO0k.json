So that's at least five subtasks under MAINTASK: Check water, feed them, pat them. Wait, but they also mention having a \"fireside chat with piglets,\" so maybe they have a camera set up, but maybe it's just them talking to the camera pretending to chat. I wonder if that counts as a task? Probably not, but the actual interaction with the pigs does. Wait, perhaps not. The viewers are seeing a Montage of the farmer interacting with the piglets, so the main task would be the care and feeding.",
