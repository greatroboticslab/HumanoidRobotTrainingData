            "task": "First, the main task is setting up the watering system. That's the MAINTASK. Then, I need to brainstorm the subtasks involved in setting this up. From the transcript, it starts with getting a 1100-gallon water tank. They're connecting it to an irrigation ditch, which is on top of a hill. The setup includes using PVC pipes, glue, and various fittings like valves and reducers. There's some mention of how they'll run water from the ditch to the tank and then distribute it to the garden.",
            "subtasks": [
                "Gluing PVC pipes and fittings. They talk about using primer and glue, which is a crucial step. Another subtask is assembling the water tank's connection to the irrigation ditch. They mention the ditch, the box with the lock, and the pipe coming out. The connection process probably involves cutting pipes, attaching fittings like the four to three reducer, and slip threads.",
                "Installing valves and reducers. This might include selecting the right size reducers and ensuring the valves are correctly installed. They also talk about potential future expansion, so maybe they\u2019re leaving room for additional connections or another tank. That's another subtask: Planning future extensions."
