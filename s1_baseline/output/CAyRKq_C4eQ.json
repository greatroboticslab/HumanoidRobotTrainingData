The transcript starts by saying operators should check the operator's manuals for safety practices. That's a key point. So a subtask could be referring to the operator's manual. But actually, maybe the main task should be more broad. Let me think again. The entire video is about safety procedures related to fueling and maintaining tractors. So maybe the main task is \"Fueling and daily maintenance on tractors and other farm equipment.\" Yeah, that seems better. So MAINTASK: Fueling and daily maintenance on tractors and other farm equipment.",
