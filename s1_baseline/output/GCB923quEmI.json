For example, walking the land (MAINTASK 1) is a physical activity, but it's part of due diligence in real estate rather than a farming operation. Similarly, understanding leases (MAINTASK 2) is a necessary business step but not a hands-on agricultural task. Tax considerations (MAINTASK 3) and fiduciary duties (MAINTASK 4) are primarily related to the real estate aspect of farming operations, not the physical act of farming.",
