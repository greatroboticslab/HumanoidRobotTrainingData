Even though a significant portion of the transcript focuses on worker conditions, which may not directly pertain to the tasks being performed, the presence of several task-related mentions (planting, harvesting, cleaning, sorting) justifies including these MAINTASK and SUBTASKS. However, because the video also discusses broader agricultural and labor issues, which are outside the scope of physical tasks, the relevance is somewhat weakened. But since the user instructed to make tasks based on what's in the transcript, and the transcript does have multiple references to planting, harvesting, and post-harvest operations that are intrinsically physical, it's appropriate to include those. Therefore, despite some sections being less relevant, the core tasks of planting, harvesting, cleaning, and sorting garlic are significant physical activities, so I will proceed to list those tasks."
