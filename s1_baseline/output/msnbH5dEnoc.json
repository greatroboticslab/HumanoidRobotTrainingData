                "The task list includes both planting and harvesting tasks in garlic farming. First, there's operating specialized machinery to plant garlic cloves evenly, which involves handling the soil beds and cloves to ensure proper spacing and depth. Second, the predominant harvest method involves manual labor, including pulling the bulbs carefully from the ground, cleaning them, trimming roots and leaves, and placing them into crates. Workers endure long hours and physically demanding tasks in outdoor conditions, emphasizing the importance of their role despite challenging working conditions and modest wages. The transcript's description of immigrant labor provides context for the physical and economic aspects of these tasks. Answer: Garlic farming in California involves operating planting machinery (MAINTASK) which includes **SUBTASK**s like preparing soil and clove distribution. Garlic harvesting (MAINTASK) is done manually (SUBTASK), involving pulling, cleaning, and sorting bulbs. Workers face physical challenges (long hours,Subtasks like continuous bending, but also reflect their importance as \"silent heroes\" of the agricultural supply chain. **Answer**"
