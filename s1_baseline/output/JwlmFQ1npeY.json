Then, open containers carefully (putting on low surface, using sharp tools, washing tools afterwards). Measure pesticide accurately as per label, pour carefully. So maybe there are three main tasks: safety measures (subtasks), opening containers (subtasks), and handling the pesticide (measuring, pouring). But combining the safety aspects as one main task encompasses the general precautions, then the container handling and pesticide handling as others. As per the transcript order, safety first, then opening, then measuring. But since the initial action is to wear protective gear, I make that the main task because it's the first thing one would do before starting. Then, proceed to handling the container safely, then measuring, etc. But in reality, the earliest step is looking at the label for the amount. Hmm. Without knowing the actual sequence, it's hard to order. Maybe both putting on protection and then reading the label. Wait, sometimes you may need the amount before putting on extra protection, but perhaps the label is part of the handling. Alternatively, after safely handling the container, you would measure. So perhaps the initial step is MAINTASK: \"Follow instructions for safe use and handling of pesticides,\" which contains all the steps. Then the transcript goes into specific steps. Hmm, but the structure isn't explicit. The first sentence is literally \"Wear extra protection when mixing and loading pesticides. Use an apron over your protective equipment. You need to wear protective eyewear too.\" So those are the first things to do. Then the rest are more detailed actions. So maybe first MAINTASK: Wear extra protection (subtasks are apron, eyewear). Followed by subtasks for using the apron and eyewear. Then proceed to handling containers\u2014open carefully, use sharp tools. Then measuring and pouring. Each of these with their own subtasks. The part about following the label directions is a subtask under measuring, or a separate one? Probably separate. Because after you've put on protection, opened the container safely, that's when you look at the label to know how much to use. So maybe step by step: first put on protection, then open container (subtask: ensure low surface), use sharp tools (subtask: if you have to tear, clean afterwards). Then, after that, follow label directions. So the label is for determining the amount. Then measure it and pour, being careful. So the subtasks under \"open carefully\" would be putting on low surface, using sharp knife/scissors, washing afterwards. Then subtask \"follow label directions\" would be looking at the label to determine quantity. Then measure carefully. Then pour. So let's structure it as follows:",
