So the machinery's operation is physical in the sense that the individual has to start, control, and adjust the machines. Therefore, all these are valid subtasks. Additionally, the inspection, unblocking, and loading/unloading are physical activities, so they're included here. Processing facility operations include moving heavy bins, operating conveyor systems, which are physical tasks, even if machinery is involved. Therefore, the summarization above is accurate."
