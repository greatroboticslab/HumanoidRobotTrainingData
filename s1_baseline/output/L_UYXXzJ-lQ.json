If we stretch a bit, perhaps there might be some physical tasks involved in planting or tending to the plants during those three years. Like, for instance, planting them in the first year (though that's usually done before three years), or weeding, watering, fertilizing, etc., but the transcript doesn't specify any of that. So it's vague. Since the instruction requires tasks related to physical actions involved in farming or agriculture, and this transcript is mostly informational, maybe the relevant tasks are more about understanding the process rather than the actual physical labor. Hence, the MAINTASK is about understanding the process, with subtasks about recognizing the growth period and its benefits in terms of blooms.",

            "task": "Alternatively, if the person is planting the peonies, then maybe the tasks would be planting, watering, etc. But since the timing is up to three years, those daily actions are implied. But if the video actually shows someone performing those physical acts, the transcript might include that. However, as it's given, the transcript is just a statement about the process. So the tasks would relate to understanding the process. Therefore, I think the main task is understanding Monrovia's growing process (MAINTASK) with subtasks recognizing the duration and its benefits. Since all the information pertains to the cultivation process and not the physical labor, that's what I'll stick with. However, perhaps for the sake of including some physical component, even if it's implied.",
