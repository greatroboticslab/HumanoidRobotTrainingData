The transcript is about the process of peanut growth, from planting to harvest, mentioning that the plants take four months, flowers bloom above and pegs grow below. So tasks related to each of those stages. Planting, monitoring, harvesting. Seems good. So I'll put MAINTASKs for each of those, then the subtasks underneath.",

Also, since the prompt says to include only tasks related to farming, agriculture, or operating farming equipment, and as long as the tasks involve physical actions, they should be included. So that's what we've done here. Each subtask is a specific action a person would take in a farming context.",
