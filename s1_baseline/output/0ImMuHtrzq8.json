                "Choose tractors with loaders included or accessible options for quick-attach systems rather than pin buckets, which are expensive to convert.",
                "Opt for newer tractors with strong manufacturer support and shorter models from reliable brands, avoiding older models unless you have the necessary skills and availability of parts.",
                "Be cautious of specific models known for problems (e.g., Kubota B3350, John Deere 2320/2305) and research thoroughly before purchasing.",
                "Consider dealer proximity for maintenance and service, especially with extended warranties, to minimize costs and downtime."
