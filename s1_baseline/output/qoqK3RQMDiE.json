Do not forget to include the reason after the colon if the video transcript is irrelevant. The entire transcript must be irrelevant. Otherwise, if it is still somewhat relevant, just save the tasks of the relevant actions, and do not write '!!!TRANSCRIPT\\_IRRELEVANT': Even if only a small part of the transcript is relevant. However, after careful consideration, the majority of the transcript is vague and philosophical, referring to upgrades, reports, and discussions without concrete tasks. There may be bits and pieces like \"shear sheep,\" but given that the context is unclear, these are too ambiguous to be included. If I choose to list the potential tasks I could infer, even vaguely, perhaps to risk including extra but I shouldn't. Wait, according to the user's instructions, start each line with MAINTASK: then followed by the task, then on each subsequent line SUBTASK: then the subtasks. So even if they are not clear, if mentioned in the transcript, they should be considered. So let's list all the possible tasks that could be extracted from even vague references."

Given that, and if per our previous conclusion, the transcript is primarily about discussions and philosophy rather than task execution, the appropriate response is to flag it as irrelevant. However, according to the final instructions, if any of the key agricultural activities are mentioned even if not in detail, one can include those. For example, the mention of the Chinese students indicates they might be on a tour, so managing tours is a task. Similarly, discussing shearing equipment may imply that there are sheep to be sheared. Therefore, if the user includes those in the transcript, they can be included as potential MAINTASKs with subtasks.",
