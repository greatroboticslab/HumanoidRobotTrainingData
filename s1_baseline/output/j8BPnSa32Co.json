However, the statement \"today, Nani has improved its sanitation, agricultural produce, and has clean drinking water\" suggests that these are all part of the agricultural context. So perhaps the school improvement is indirectly related to agricultural education? But the video mentions the trainings on sustainable development, which include watershed management and organic farming. So, maybe the MAINTASK on Community efforts also includes tasks related to those trainings.",
