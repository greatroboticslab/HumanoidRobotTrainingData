            "task": "understanding raspberry growth. The video talks about primocanes and floricanes. So a task would be to differentiate between these. That could be a subtask. Then there's the signs of silvering and brittleness in second-year growth. Another subtask. They mention identifying the growth stages of primocanes (like green and thick versus the light brown dead wood). I need to think, what physical tasks would you perform related to that? Maybe something like visually inspecting canes during dormant season? Removing old growth? Or selecting primocanes for staking? Then for the different varieties, the video mentions summer-bearing, autumn-bearing, and everbearing raspberries. The audience is advised to choose based on their preferences for when they want the harvest. But in terms of physical tasks, does that involve anything? Just keeping notes? No, I think the variety selection is more of a planning task. Moving on to pruning techniques. The video says once a year you need to remove old floricanes. That's a physical task: cutting down dead canes. Retaining and staking the primocanes for next year's growth would be another task. Supporting the vigorous primocanes with stakes. Another physical activity. For care and maintenance, watering is discussed. Checking soil moisture and ensuring it's optimal. I can imagine checking soil with a finger or a moisture meter. But since that's not specified, maybe just noticing when the leaves droop. That's a visual check. Another task could be adjusting watering based on these signs. Fertilizing using foliar feeding. That might involve mixing a solution and spraying it on the leaves. Planting in a sunny spot is mentioned. So planting the raspberries in a suitable location would be a task. But perhaps that's part of the initial setup. If this is a video about ongoing care, then selecting a sunny spot would already be done, but maintaining that might be part of the care. Keeping the soil well-drained with organic matter\u2014maybe tasks like adding organic material or mulching, but that's not directly in the transcript. The transcript notes that raspberries don't like waterlogged soil, so maintaining proper drainage is important. So maybe subtasks could include adding organic matter or checking drainage. However, since that's not explicitly mentioned, I might leave that out. Let me see. Another point is the video mentions not overpruning, like in the blackberry video. Wait, the transcript references the blackberry video for more detailed pruning. So perhaps in their channel, there's another video with more-practical demonstrations. But since this video is less on pruning and more on general care, perhaps the main focus here is on understanding the growth cycle and when to perform actions. So in the subtasks, maybe they need to recognize when primocanes and floricanes are present, when to prune, when to watch for harvest. So perhaps during each growth stage, you have specific tasks? For example, in spring, you start by identifying primocanes and floricanes. Then in summer, check for harvests. In autumn, prepare for pruning. And in winter, prune and prepare for next year. Maybe break it down into quarterly tasks? But perhaps the main task is understanding the growth stages. So arranging tasks under MAINTASK: Understanding Raspberry Growth. Under that, they can subtasks like Learn to Differentiate Primocanes and Floricanes, Watch for Growth Stages (spring, summer, autumn), etc. But since the transcript is more about explaining the growth process, maybe the key takeaway task is Understanding Raspberry Growth and How to Prune, which involves knowing the difference between prim and floricane. Another thing the transcript mentions is that raspberries don't require a lot of care but a close eye on watering. So the watering task would be to monitor soil moisture. This could be a daily check\u2014checking the soil. Yeah, they mention \"the tree will talk to you\" so noticing when leaves droop. So monitoring for signs of dehydration. Similarly, checking for overwatering signs. So maybe tasks for watering could be:",
