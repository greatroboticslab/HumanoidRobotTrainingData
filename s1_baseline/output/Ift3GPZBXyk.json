Let me check if I'm missing anything. Oh, the speaker mentions to look at the fact sheet for more info. Maybe that could be a task, but since it's more of an external resource, perhaps not necessary for the tasks directly derived from the transcript. The other part about the Jacksonville Foundation and Austin is completely off-topic, so I should disregard that.",
