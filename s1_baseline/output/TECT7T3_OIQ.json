                "Acquire cilantro seeds (possibly from the gardener's own kitchen).",
                "Research and choose a suitable variety of cilantro (e.g., a slow-bolting type).",
                "Prepare garden soil for planting cilantro (light, well-drained, and not too wet).",
                "Directly sow cilantro seeds in rows or clumps, spacing them appropriately (about 1 cm apart).",
                "Cover seed with a light layer of soil since they require darkness to germinate.",
                "Water the area adequately, keeping the soil moist but not waterlogged, especially during germination (a week or more).",
                "Protect the planted area from frost if needed, ensuring soil temperature stays around 18-21\u00b0C (65-70\u00b0F) for optimal germination.",
                "Adjust planting dates according to the last frost date and soil warming, using a calendar or planting chart to plan subsequent sowings every two weeks.",
                "Consider companion planting to maximize space, such as placing cilantro under taller plants like beans or tomatoes.",
                "Provide ample water to the cilantro plants, especially keeping the soil temperature down with mulch.",
                "Monitor for signs of bolting (e.g., texture change, bitterness), and plan to remove plants after about a month of harvest when bolting begins.",
                "Harvest cilantro by cutting the leaves or the entire plant, depending on availability, ensuring two-week regrowth periods when possible.",
                "Preserve cilantro by making salsa verde or other sauces, which can be frozen or jarred for long-term storage.",
                "Grow microgreen cilantro in trays under grow lights during winter months for fresh supply, harvesting young shoots for garnish or flavor."
