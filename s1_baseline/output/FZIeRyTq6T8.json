Given that the person could be either the farmer (performing all actions) or the viewer (no physical tasks except possibly sharing if the content was shared somewhere, but no, probably they have to \"perform\" by maybe repeating the action). However, as this is on a script transcript, the person is probably to apply the same actions. Thus, the video shows Uncle Tim doing these things, so likely a viewer would need to perform the same tasks if they want to replicate it. Therefore, all the farm-related tasks are relevant. However, the part about subscribing and saying goodbye is part of the video's script but perhaps less applicable to someone who's not a subscriber or doesn't want to interact. However, since the viewer is asked for the tasks in relation to the transcript, maybe include them? But depending on how the instructions treat it. Wait, the user's specific instruction: \"generate a series of tasks based on the transcript that a person would have to perform\", meaning that the person (presumably a farmer) would need to employ a series of tasks. So I think the farm-related tasks (putting down mulch etc.) are the main ones. The other bits (subscribing etc.) are for the video\u2019s host/owner and the viewers\u2019 engagement.",
