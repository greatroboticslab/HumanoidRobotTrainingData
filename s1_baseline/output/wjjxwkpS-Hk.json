Maybe the user needs the entire list as a single block, but the instructions didn\u2019t specify formatting. Just tasks separated by a new line. Let me check again. If the user specified to have MAINTASK: before every task header, but then single tasks, but wait, maybe the user wants a top-level task, then each subtask as a level down. However, the user said \"MAINTASK: give a list of subtasks, one per line.\" Hmm, perhaps structure is important here.",
