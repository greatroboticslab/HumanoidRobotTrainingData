But given that the transcript has no other actions, the most accurate answer would be that the main task is expressing gratitude with physical gestures, with subtasks being the components of that expression, repeated each time. So 15 instances of the subtasks, each time lifting arms, tilting head, smiling. But, is it efficient to list each \"thank you\" as a separate task? The instruction says \"a series of tasks based on the transcript that a person would have to perform,\" but given that each \"thank you\" is one performance, maybe each is its own task, but that might be too micro. Alternatively, consolidating them. For example:",
