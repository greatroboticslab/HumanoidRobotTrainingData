Ellie encouraged everyone to have a good day, express gratitude towards Allie for producing good calves. Encourage viewers to like and share for energy to keep up the good work. Remember to keep the fences secure next week to keep the herd putting weight on the calf. Solicit feedback on stanchion training methods, noting how Allie stands well alongside strong hind legs. Small adjustments in calf positioning are possible, such as adding a coke bottle for her to pull with her feet, which might be a dynamic way to stimulate movement while creating a safe environment."
