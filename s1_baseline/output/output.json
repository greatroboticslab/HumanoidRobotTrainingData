        "category": " I am going to show how to transplant strawberries. The conventional thought about strawberries is that they don't grow here in Goa. But there are varieties that are now available that actually do quite well in hot tropical weather as you can see my condition. So we have Nabila and Flaminia. These are two varieties. They work in pretty poor soil. They sort of tolerate humidity and they are pretty prolific and early producers. So the flowering is expected in about 45 to 60 days. Now the main thing to remember about strawberry is that even though it grows in cooler places, it requires full sun which means a minimum of 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight. If they don't get direct sunlight, they just produce a lot of leaves and you will see no flowering. So make sure that it gets direct sunlight. Make sure that you give it less water, not too much water. Conditions in Goa are very humid. And don't give it a lot of fertilizer until the flowering happens. That's three things to remember. Once you see the first flowering, then you can give it a little bit of vermicompost, maybe a handful of vermicompost or a little bit of panchagavia. But too much of fertilizer at the beginning means that it will just produce a lot of leaves and not a lot of flowers. I will begin by showing you how to transplant these into pots. Basically I have taken these shallow containers. They are about 6 inches deep. They have holes at the bottom so that the water can drain out. It should not create swampy conditions. I have filled the pot with regular potting soil that contains a mix of cocopeat, garden soil and vermicompost up to about an inch from the top. The one thing to remember about strawberry is that this is the growing tip. This is from where the new leaves are going to come out. So when you transplant make sure not to bury this under soil otherwise you will kill the growing tip and more leaves will not come. It's really easy to do. Look at the size of the cup. You need to make a depression in your pot about that big. You turn this over, gently press the cup and give it a yank from this side and the entire plug will come out. There you go. You can see the root development of the strawberry plant. Now this must be put into the hole over here gently. Try not to break the root ball too much. Make sure that you are clear of the growing tip. Gently press it in so that it is firm and erect and not lolling all over. And that is one plant transplanted. This is about an inch, one foot in diameter, 12 inches in diameter. So in a pot of that size I will put about two strawberry plants. And lastly I will cover the soil with leaf mulch to maintain soil quality and to retain moisture better. The mulch also prevents the strawberry fruit from touching the soil and protects it from rotting. We usually plant strawberry saplings in the month of October and fruits are ready for harvest by early January.

        "category": " Are you considering starting a small business or investing in agriculture? If so, you're in the right place. Agriculture offers incredible opportunities for growth and profit, but knowing where to start can be overwhelming. In this video, we'll explore one of the most promising agricultural ventures for 2025, helping you make informed decisions for your future. Don't forget to like this video and subscribe to our channel for more insights and tips on all things agriculture. Let's dive in and unlock your potential in this thriving industry. Modern farming leverages technology and innovative practices to increase efficiency and sustainability. It encompasses various techniques, including precision agriculture, hydroponics, aquaponics, and of course, greenhouse farming. The method allows farmers to produce more food using fewer resources, which is essential as the global population continues to rise. Now, let's focus on greenhouse farming. A greenhouse is a controlled environment where plants can thrive regardless of the weather outside. This method allows for year-round production, enabling farmers to grow high-value crops like tomatoes, cucumbers, and herbs all year long. Greenhouses provide a controlled environment that protects plants from extreme weather conditions, pests, and diseases. By regulating temperature, humidity, light, and ventilation, farmers can create optimal growing conditions year-round. This control leads to healthier plants and significantly reduces the risk of crop failure due to unpredictable weather, making it a reliable option for both small and large-scale producers. One of the most significant advantages of greenhouse farming is the ability to extend the growing season. This extended season allows for multiple crop cycles within a year, increasing overall yield and profitability. For example, while traditional outdoor farming may yield one or two crops a year, a greenhouse can potentially produce four or more. The controlled conditions of a greenhouse often lead to higher yields compared to traditional farming methods. Plants grown in greenhouses can be nurtured to grow faster and larger. This enhanced growth can significantly boost your return on investment, making greenhouse farming a financially appealing option for aspiring entrepreneurs. Greenhouse farming is generally more water-efficient than traditional farming. The enclosed environment minimizes evaporation and runoff, allowing for better water retention. Many greenhouses also use hydroponic or aquaponic systems, which can further reduce water usage while providing an ideal nutrient solution directly to the plant's roots. This efficiency is not only environmentally friendly, but also reduces costs associated with water supply. In a greenhouse setting, the risk of pests and diseases is significantly lower due to the controlled environment. The risk of pests and pests are more effective. Farmers can implement integrated pest management, IPM strategies more effectively, utilizing beneficial insects and organic treatments without relying heavily on chemical pesticides. This leads to healthier crops and a more sustainable farming practice, appealing to consumers looking for organic options. If you're considering starting a greenhouse business, you're on the path to an exciting and rewarding venture. How to improve your growth and growth? Greenhouse farming offers a unique opportunity to control growing conditions, extend the growing season, and boost your yields. However, getting started can seem overwhelming. That's why I'm here to guide you through the essential steps for launching your greenhouse farming journey. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your approach, these steps will provide you with the foundational knowledge you need to succeed in this dynamic field. How to improve your greenhouse dreams? Let's dive in and explore how you can turn your greenhouse dreams into reality. 1. Research and planning Before diving into greenhouse farming, thorough research is crucial. Understand the types of crops you want to grow and their specific requirements. Consider your local climate, market demand, and available resources. Creating a detailed business plan will help outline your goals, budget, and strategies for success. 2. Choosing the right location Selecting an ideal location for your greenhouse is vital. Look for an area that receives ample sunlight, has good drainage, and is accessible for transportation. Proximity to your target market can also reduce logistics costs. Ensure the site is not prone to flooding or extreme winds, which could damage your greenhouse structure. 3. Selecting the greenhouse structure There are various types of greenhouse structures including freestanding, lean-to, and hoop houses. Each has its advantages, so choose one that fits your budget and crop needs. Materials like glass, polycarbonate, or polyethylene film will affect light transmission and insulation. Consider investing in a structure that allows for easy expansion as your business grows. 4. Implementing climate control systems To maximize your greenhouse's potential, invest in climate control systems. This may include heating, cooling, ventilation, and shading systems. Automated controls can help maintain optimal conditions, reducing labor and ensuring consistent growth. Monitoring systems for humidity and temperature can also provide crucial data to fine-tune your environment. 5. Soil and nutrient management Decide whether to use traditional soil-based growing or hydroponic systems. If using soil, ensure it is well-draining and rich in nutrients. Regular testing and amendment of soil will promote healthy plant growth. For hydroponics, establish a nutrient solution that meets your plant's specific needs, closely monitoring pH and nutrient levels. 6. Pest and disease prevention Develop a proactive pest and disease management plan. Regularly inspect plants for signs of problems and implement IPM strategies to minimize chemical use. Encourage beneficial insects and consider organic treatments as part of your approach. Healthy plants grown in a controlled environment are less susceptible to issues, but vigilance is key. 7. Marketing and sales Once your greenhouse starts producing, think about how to market and sell your crops. Build relationships with local grocery stores, farmers markets, and restaurants. 8. Utilize social media and online platforms to reach a broader audience. 9. Quality produce and effective marketing can help establish a loyal customer base and drive your business forward. 10. While greenhouse farming is fantastic, several other modern farming techniques can enhance productivity and sustainability. 10. Hydroponics involves growing plants in nutrient-rich water instead of soil, allowing for faster growth rates as plants can access nutrients directly. 11. This method can be set up indoors or outdoors, making it versatile and space efficient, especially for urban farmers looking to maximize yields while minimizing the risk of soil-borne diseases. 11. Aquaponics builds on hydroponics by integrating fish farming into the system. 12. In this sustainable ecosystem, fish waste provides organic nutrients for the plants, which in turn filter and purify the water for the fish. 12. This closed-loop system minimizes waste and promotes environmental sustainability, 12. Making it an excellent option for those interested in both aquaculture and horticulture. 13. A Trial farming Vertical farming uses stacked layers to grow crops in controlled environments, which is particularly beneficial in urban areas with limited space. 14. A Trial farming Vertical farming uses stacked layers to grow crops in controlled environments, which is particularly beneficial in urban areas with limited space. 15. This method significantly increases crop yields per square foot and optimizes conditions such as light and water, resulting in healthier plants and reduced resource use. 15.

        "category": " By the way, maize farmers, have you ever asked yourself this question? How many number of bugs do you produce in your small piece of land? Do you produce such number of bugs because you assume you know how to farm maize? Or it's because of ignorance to learn new knowledge on how you can grow much better? Well, I don't want you to answer me that, but today we are focusing on the basic on how you can manage to grow maize and get hired from planting to harvesting, including the best soil for maize farming. And we are going to jump right away on the best soil for maize farming. Maize thrives in fertile loam or sandy loam soils. Supplementing these soils with cow or sheep manure can enhance growth and when it rains, this mixture retains moisture, further promoting growth. Conversely, clay soil can has poor drainage and can lead to flooding which starts growth and results in more weeds. After getting light on the best soil for maize farming, now let's focus on which are these best varieties of maize that you can plant in Kenya and get good weeds. Now, the suitability of maize varieties varies by regions. In the North Rift region, where there is only one maize season, five-month maize varieties are the best. These varieties have high yields, producing over 50 bags of 90 kg per acre. Some of the recommended varieties include Pioneer that 253, Pioneer that G19, H614, H628, H629. It is crucial to plant these varieties during the long-range season for the best results. In regions with two maize seasons, farmers should opt for three-month maturity maize varieties. These fast-mature-green varieties such as haraka-11, haraka-31, sduma-43, ssungura-31, dkc-831, dk-833, and savoy-4141 typically yield an average of 25 to 35 90 kg bags per acre and matures within 75 to 90 days. After getting it right on the best maize varieties, then how well do you plant these seeds? Before planting, ensure the land is clear of weeds. Farmers can either weed manually or you can use non-selective herbicides such as kausha or roundup. A recommended plant is spacing of 60 cm by 30 cm compared with the traditional 90 cm by 25 cm increases crop population per acre, requiring a seed rate of 11 to 12 kg per acre and of course the yield. If you've seen a maize planter, calibrate it first for precise spacing. After planting, this crop needs to be fed with the best fertilizers and then that's why we give you the best maize fertilizers. The yields per acre are influenced not only by the maize variety but also by proper fertilization. High crop populations require adequate cbm. To bless with DAP 1846-0 on the 10th day after sowing to promote faster growth. At this stage, the maize plants have developed strong roots that can absorb nitrogen and phosphorus effectively. Using fertilizers during planting is not effective as seeds do not utilize them. Leading to reaching DAP is preferred of NPK 2320-0 due to its high phosphorus content which supports rapid root growth. NPK 2320-0 should be top-traced on the per acre day after sowing. While CAN fertilizer should be applied 55 days after sowing to enhance seed formation and weed to gain. After planting, you need to control the pest. The fall amyron is a significant pest in maize farming responsible for more than 50% of crop loss. To control fall, apply a marron that you see or escort ideally 21 to 40 days later, that is after sowing. This should be combined with a sticker such as Integra or Aquavit and a booster for your feed. This application is most effective when done in the late evening when the fall amyron is most effective. When you've done this, you need not to control weeds. Keep the farm free of weeds at all times. This is essential. Farmers can choose between manual weeding or using selective herbicides such as Tinga Tinga, Gavana, Maguguma, Diamine, 2-4-D, and Maze. And the replacement trees still all this. They simplify the work of controlling weeds. Also implementing zero tillage can help conserve moisture thereby promoting faster growth. Now with all this you have a complete guide that you can follow step by step and manage to yield more from your a small piece of land.

        "category": " Soybeans or edamame are one of the tastiest beans you can grow in your garden. In today's episode we will show you everything from planting soybeans and harvesting them as well as a delicious edamame recipe. So there are two ways to start soybeans. You can get seed packets from Home Depot or loaves. And sow the seeds when the weather is warm enough for soybeans to grow. Spring, Summer and Fall are the best times. Soybeans can grow very well in the summer heat here in Southern California. When starting from seeds, you can sow 6 to 8 seeds in one whiskey barrel container like you see here. The soil we have is a mix of compost, peat moss and perlite. After sowing the seeds, make sure you water well and now you are done sowing the seeds. The other way to grow soybeans is to grow it from transplants. You can buy 6 pack starter plants at your local nurseries like the one you see here and then plant them. Buying transplants for soybean saves you a lot of time growing it from seeds. Once again we are growing this in a whiskey barrel container and we are planting 6 plants in one barrel. This container is 22 inches wide and 15 inches tall. Holds about 2 and a half cubic feet of soil. Our planting mix already has a good mix of organic nutrients in the soil. We will be using an organic liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks as the plant grows as well as some worm tea. Links to all these products will be provided in the video description. Once planted, water well so that the roots can settle into their new home. Soybeans grow best in temperatures of 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. In a few weeks from planting, you can see two things. The plant has problems with both insects and diseases. Caterpillars, spider mites, they all love the soybean plant. Making growing soybeans a challenging project in your garden. And here you can see a fungal disease called rust, which the soybean plant is very prone to. It's a brown powder-like fungal disease on the plant. You can also see spider mite damage on the soybean plant in a very short span of time. So what do you do? Well, it's neem oil to the rescue. Neem oil is an insecticide to kill insects. It's a fungicide to stop rust. And it's also a meticide, which means it can stop spider mites. So a generous drenching of diluted neem oil will give some respite to these soybean plants. Spray both under and over the leaves and drench the plant completely. Repeat this weekly till you don't see any signs of insects or diseases. And as you can see, even after the weekly neem oil applications, the rust and the spider mites have emerged stronger. The plant still has some damage due to these. However, does this really affect production? Well, we'll soon find out. Soybeans grow in full sun. So choose a nice sunny spot with at least six to eight hours of sunlight for your soybeans. We are transplanting six more soybean plants into this raised bed, which receives a lot of sunlight. And here you can see the progress after a few days. You can see that the rust and spider mites are still an issue here with these soybean plants growing on the raised bed. So it's been about two months since we transplanted our seedlings. And now you can see the soybeans forming pods. And within these pods are the actual soybeans or edamame. So it's the time to harvest. When harvesting, remove the entire pods. And this is how soybeans look like. They look pretty good. And I really wish these plants were a little rust resistant. But overall, for the size of the plants, we're getting a decent harvest. So what's the biggest advantage of growing soybeans at home? Well, they're non-GMO. They're much better for your health than commercially grown soybeans. And they're very delicious as well. To get a good harvest of soybeans, remember to fertilize your soybean plants with a good organic liquid fertilizer as well as worm tea for good results. And here is our harvest. As you can see, we got a lot of soybeans for the size of the plants we had. So I'm quite happy with the results. If I had grown more plants, I would have gotten more soybeans. The soybean plants growing in our raised beds also gave us some soybeans. But you can see the plant had no vigor despite us providing all the nutrients as well as protection from insects and diseases. Let's open up these soybean pods to show you how the soybean looks like inside the pods. And these are the soybeans that you can eat raw or steamed or cooked. Once the plants have completed producing their pods for harvest, you can go ahead and remove the plants. What I wanted to show you here is to pay attention to the roots. The soybean plant has roots that are relatively shallow, which means that you can grow them in shallower containers as well. Like the ones smaller than the whiskey barrel container shown here. Soybean plants fix nitrogen in the soil. They have bacteria in their roots that fix nitrogen from the air and make it available for the plant to use. Since these plants had fungal diseases like rust, I will not be composting these plants. But rather they will go into the yard waste bin. And now let's look at a delicious recipe for our harvested soybeans or edamame. We are preparing air fried edamame. First we take the soybeans whole with the pods in a bowl. Then we add in some salt. I usually use Himalayan salt. But this time I had sea salt. So that's what we'll be using. Add in a little bit of oil. Remember that very little of this oil will be actually absorbed by the edamame. But adding oil gives a very nice flavor to the pods when you're eating the edamame. And that is quite amazing. The oil also helps the salt to stick to the pods more evenly. You can skip the oil if you do not want it. You can preheat your air fryer if needed. I did not. I did not. Add the soybean pods or edamame to the air fryer. Set the air fryer to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. And cook for about 15 to 20 minutes. Tossing them around the halfway mark. Soybean dishes are actually called edamame. Because in Japanese, the term edamame means stem beans. Or the preparation where beans are still attached to the pod when cooking. As you can see here, the pods protect the soybeans from overcooking. And these homegrown soybeans will be one of the best tasting soybeans you will ever eat. Soybeans are packed with protein and are a very important part of a healthy vegetarian or vegan diet. You can also steam your soybeans and add a little salt for a delicious dish. Growing soybeans is one of the best summer treats from your garden. So I highly recommend that you try growing soybeans this season. Try growing soybeans this season. So there we have it folks. That was our episode on growing soybeans in your home garden.

        "category": " Hi my dear friends and welcome back to GROW. Today we grow romaine lettuce. Hi again! Today I'm very excited because I'm going to share with you a very easy technique to grow lettuce, even from the lettuce that you buy from the supermarket. It's very easy, very healthy and it grows really quickly. So let's get to it. So in order to grow your lettuce from the lettuce that you bought in the supermarket, you will need your romaine lettuce, of course, a knife, a cutting board, one jar or tupperware, I'm actually reusing a marmalade jar, toothpicks and water. So as you can see this lettuce was cut from the root here. It has no roots here, but that's not a problem. All you have to do is keep this part from your lettuce. So we're gonna cut it now and I'll show you how it goes. Okay, so welcome to the kitchen! Okay, we're gonna cut the lettuce at about five centimeters from the end of the lettuce and then you can save the rest in the fridge. After you cut the end of your lettuce, you will have something like this. So as you can see, you have the end here, no roots there, and the lettuce. What we're gonna do now is use the toothpicks to put in the lettuce. So I'm gonna put one here, maybe another one right here, another one here, and another one here. So we have four toothpicks, just like this, and I'm gonna set it aside. Now we're gonna use our jar. So fill up the jar with water. All the way up. And now we're gonna put the lettuce inside the jar and make sure that it's actually touching the water. I'm gonna fill it up a little bit more all the way to the top so I make sure that the water is actually touching the lettuce. Now, your lettuce will need some sunlight to grow, so make sure that you put the lettuce in a place with a sunny window so it gets lots of sunlight so you can grow quicker. All right! Okay, so as you can see, this lettuce grows really quickly. Remember to always change the water every one or two days so you keep it clear and clean. Now, this lettuce has been in water for about three weeks, and as you can see, the leaves are big and green. I think when your lettuce gets to this size, this is the best time to harvest and eat the leaves. This is because keeping in mind that this lettuce is not getting as much ingredients as she would get in the soil, the leaves are gonna start becoming more bitter. So the best time to eat this lettuce is at this point. I have read that we can actually transplant this lettuce to soil so she can get the nutrients that she needs. So I'm gonna try it today, I'm gonna try to transplant this lettuce to soil and see if she actually survives. I hope that she does. And I'm gonna show you now how I'm gonna transplant it to soil and then I'm just gonna show you the progress on my Instagram account. So let's hope it works. Okay, so let's get to transplanting. So first, in this container I'm gonna put organic all-purpose soil. Now we're going to make a hole for the lettuce and this one will be about five centimeters. We take the two sticks out, like so, and we're gonna put the lettuce inside. Try to compress the soil. Guys, it looks so pretty! And now I'm just gonna water a little bit so I make sure that the soil is moist. Okay, so our first transplanted lettuce is finally ready. I will make sure to share the progress with you on Instagram. Wish this beautiful lettuce luck and hopefully it survives. Of course, if you're growing lettuce with me, please make sure to share with me on Instagram. I would love to see it and we will share with the community. If you're watching this video live, let's keep the chat going over here and if you're watching it afterwards, thank you for being here and please leave a comment. I will make sure to reply. Will you be growing lettuce with me? In the water! Will you be growing lettuce with me? In the water! Chance quelques to share, go out. Just ping us up. Just pause. When helping me ask ourselves, let's just hold my wastewater to be proud of the trees and this one. Team welfare is a problem. To leave it out with me is that the building What is your favorite salad recipe or dressing recipe? My favorite dressing is a very easy one but it reminds me of my grandmother. So I'll show you what I do. This is a lime or lemon based recipe. Today I'm going to make it with lime. You will need 1 lime, some olive oil, veggie powder broth and pepper. We are going to squeeze the lime. 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Then we will use our veggie broth, some pepper and mix. And of course try it out. Hmmmm. So let's try it out. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much for being here and watching this video. And as always, I will see you in the next one. Okay, ciao!",

        "category": " Do you want to learn how to grow rice more sustainably? Attend a KANA meeting with Extension officers in your area to select the best rice variety and create a crop calendar for the season. Extension officers will show you how to use water more efficiently and appoint a water controller. Farmers lose approximately 10 to 20 percent of their rice harvests due to pests and diseases every year. To prevent this, use seeds of the most adapted rice varieties for the area and season, available at the one-stop super. The Rice Research and Development Institute recommends these varieties for the Maha season. The Rice Research and Development Institute recommends these varieties for the Yala season. After land preparation, request laser leveling through your Extension officer to improve water efficiency and yield in your fields. Next, form buns and plaster to hold water for every season. Make sure a field water tube is placed in the field to monitor the water level. You can save water for this season and next if you plant at the beginning of the rainy, Maha season, the second week of October instead of the fourth week. Instead of broadcasting that uses up to 100 kilograms per hectare of seeds, use improved rice planting methods. Compared to broadcasting, the rice planting methods. Parachuting and line seeding reduces seed requirements by 75%. Transplanting allows 12.5% higher yields than broadcasting and saves money. If you can establish a nursery, use the parachute method or transplanting machines. After 12 to 18 days, parachute plantlets in the field. Trays can be reused for four seasons. If your plot is at least 0.2 hectares, you can request a motorized transplanting service from the one-stop super. If you don't have time to establish and protect a nursery, you can rent a line seeder, drum seeder, or direct seeding. Manage weeds for the first 30 days. For rice transplanted with a motorized paddy transplanter, use a motorized paddy weeder. For rice seeded with a drum seeder, use a manual Kono weeder to control weeds in between rows. For advice on other weed management practices, ask experts at your local crop clinic. For rice seeding, irrigate the field to 5 cm above the surface level and allow the field to drain until water level goes below 15 cm. This will take around 7 to 10 days depending on the soil type. Irrigate when the water is 15 cm below the surface level and when you see weeds. Two weeks after flowering, maintain the water level 0 to 5 cm above the surface level. Two weeks before harvesting, allow fields to drain gradually. A 3.5 month variety that has the right moisture level of 20 to 25% is ready for harvest at week 12. At the one-stop super, you can receive three services for grain moisture measurements that reduce shuttering and grain damages. After harvest, keep straw on your field. It is important to dry paddy before storing. Mobile paddy drying is an efficient and economical way to dry paddy. Find out more about FAO's approach to climate smart crop production.

        "category": " You know one of the secrets to having strawberries and be able to harvest them organically isn't that you have to use pesticides but you have to keep up on processing your crop. As you can see here this is my strawberry bed and there's still a lot of strawberries in here. I've picked all these strawberries in the last couple minutes and there's still a lot to be had. But what happens with a strawberry bed is you get a lot of these little sow bugs and a lot of other little guys in there and you have to pick them before the bugs get started on them. I pick them when they're just ripe. Tomorrow all these will be too ripe. So I don't want to let that one go another day. But if you let them sit for just a little bit too long you'll start getting little bug bites all over them from the sow bugs. Also if you can kind of pull them up as you go and the ones that are still white pull them up so that they're not sitting right on the ground. That helps a lot. That's pretty good. There's still a lot in here. A lot of little ones. And if they're too ripe like this one right here, actually I just throw them back on the ground and let the sow bugs have them. It would be nice to be able to just come in here and poison them and put all kinds of stuff in here. But I like to be able to just take a fresh strawberry right from the patch. I know there's no poison in there. The problem is when I start picking. I eat everything. So there's still good baskets of strawberries in here. I've been getting from this bed that's four feet wide by 12 feet long. I've been getting at least one to two baskets of strawberries every day. And I usually eat them as I pick them. But strawberry patches, gotta get one. That really off me down. Come in for a day. These must be great. The breaking for like But deadly. What focus on this all around theiil Semperon Boston entry? Now this is what you do tonight. Can you talk to me about this area of ? There are many things. Lots of horses, avanzchlivideprovenidos. West Virginia etc?

But one thing to keep in mind when growing pumpkins is that here in Wyoming we have a short growing season. So think about starting your pumpkin seeds inside just to get a jump on so that you can have a nice pumpkin patch towards the end of fall. There are too many varieties of pumpkins to name here now but know that there are white, orange, striped, and even giant pumpkins that can grow well over 500 pounds that all grow well here in Wyoming. As you can see here, pumpkins take up a lot of space so keep in mind when planning out your garden space where you want to have your pumpkins at. Beyond just making jack-o-lanterns, you can also grow pumpkins to eat as well. If you're looking for any more information on pumpkins, contact your local Extension office. And with the University of Wyoming Extension, I'm Hannah Johnson and you're watching From the Ground Up.",

Then, after harvesting, they need to load the grain onto a wagon. So operating the grain wagon\u2014attaching it to the combine, driving it to the storage, and unloading. Then, loading wheat onto a truck. They use a pitchfork, so I can list that subtask: gathering wheat piles with a pitchfork, then loading into truck. Storing the wheat in a silo would be another MAINTASK: driving the wagon to the silo, positioning it under the funnel, starting the auger, and monitoring. That silo storage is a task. Then, field maintenance. They go through the fields, so maybe tasks like that. Driving a utility vehicle to inspect the fields, trimming overgrown areas, restoring markers. That's a task. Then, they might be using the utility vehicle for other things, so driving the UV. That has subtasks: starting the engine, operating it, navigating. Then, applying inputs like salt and fertilizer. Preparing and loading a salt spreader: filling it, attaching to tractor, adjusting settings, operating during application. Similar for fertilizer spreading. They mention maintaining irrigation pipes, so installing pipes would be a task: measuring, cutting, connecting, securing. Then, operating the irrigation system: starting, monitoring, adjusting, stopping. Each of these main tasks would have subtasks broken down. For example, spreading salt includes filling the spreader, attaching to tractor, setting the rate, driving over the field. Let me ensure I cover all major equipment mentioned. They didn't talk about planting, but if it's post-harvest, they might do some field prep later, but not mentioned.

So MAINTASK: operate a grain wagon. Attach to combine, drive to location, unload. Then load wheat onto a truck. How do they do that? With a pitchfork. So MAINTASK: load wheat onto a truck. Subtasks: use pitchfork to pile wheat, transport to truck, load carefully. Then store wheat in silo. MAINTASK: store wheat in silo. Drive grain wagon to silo, position under funnel, start auger, monitor levels. Then they go into the fields. MAINTASK: assist in field maintenance. Driving a utility vehicle: start engine, operate, inspect boundaries, trim overgrown areas, restore markers. They also use a salt spreader which is applied using a tractor. So MAINTASK: prepare and load a salt spreader. Fill hopper, attach to tractor, adjust settings, operate during spread. Similar for fertilizer, but is it the same spreader? Let's check the transcript. \"Next, spread the fertilizer.\" It says, \"male2 prepare the fertilizer spreader then goes back to the tractor.\" So yeah, same as the salt spreader? Probably. So MAINTASK: apply fertilizer to a field. Subtasks: attach spreader to tractor, adjust settings, drive over field, check operation. For irrigation pipes, \"male1 is installing the irrigation pipes.\" Then they later \"turn on the irrigation pipes to water the crops.\" So MAINTASK: install irrigation pipes. Subtasks: measure, cut pipes, connect fittings, secure in field, connect to water source. MAINTASK: water crops using an irrigation system. Start pump, monitor water distribution, adjust as needed, shut down. That seems comprehensive. Let me check if anything else is left out. They talk about the tractor at multiple points. Like, \"male2 gets into the tractor\" before applying fertilizer. But isn't operating a tractor considered a separate task? Maybe it's included in the spreader application. Hmm, maybe not. If operating a tractor is a task, then when they attach the spreader to the tractor, that's part of operating the tractor. So perhaps the spreader preparation is when you fill it, attach to tractor? Let me think. So if they say \"male2 prepares the fertilizer spreader then goes back to the tractor,\" that could be considered as two steps: preparing the spreader (filling it, maybe) and then operating the tractor to pull it. So perhaps the application is when they drive over the field. So when putting together the tasks, maybe:",

        "category": " Guys, welcome back. Today we're going to use an ideal 48-inch tiller. You can see right here in a previous video, we used an all-purpose plow, three passes down and back. This is the finished results. We're going to compare those results versus the results of a tiller. This is the same day, all right? So we went and hooked this up right afterwards. I'm going to go down and back, see the results with one pass compared to three passes. If needed, we'll go down and back again. And I think I'm going to run this tiller over top of what I plowed already. That's just not a good enough result for me there to want to plant in. So I'm going to finish that out, smooth it out for a good seed bed before we seed later this spring. Now you guys know I'm a big fan of dirt dog equipment, but dirt dog does not offer a four foot tiller. So something for your subcompact tractors, the 1025R, Kubota BX, anything in that smallest footprint of modern day tractors. So the 48-inch that we offered this year is by Ideal Farm Equipment. So this is going to be similar to the dirt dog, that it is a made in the USA with some foreign or imported components like the gearbox, for example. So we're trying to get away from the made in China stuff whenever possible. Last year you saw us running Tar River tillers and land planes, and it was kind of our last season with them for a number of reasons. So we're switching over to more North American made companies is the gist of it. So this Ideal Tiller is going to be four foot wide. It's going to have a slip clutch on it. Something that I actually noticed I don't see very often is just basically slip clutch maintenance or almost like a checklist over here on the sticker. So that's kind of nice to see too. So we'll have similar features, what you expect, what you want to see on a tiller. So I've got the gearbox up here. This is gear driven on the side. It's not going to be chain driven. I like that a little bit more robust, I believe. Swing gate on the back with this chain, so you can adjust that. Swing your gate open if you want to or not. You're going to have a parking stand over on this far side. Now this has four blades per flange, and the thought process I think with Ideal is that you're going to put less strain on a subcompact tractor versus a six blades per flange. So we'll be able to see if there's a difference in performance as we're chilling today. But something interesting is that on the flanges themselves that the blades bolt onto, there's extra holes on there. There's four extra holes. You have two bolts per flange. So potentially you could stagger in a different way, add another flange or two more. Wow, look at them geese. That's a flock. So what I was saying was that on the flanges underneath here, right now you have four blades per flange, but there's extra holes in those flanges. So there's four extra holes total, which would equate to a total of two extra blades. So I almost feel like you could potentially add more blades onto each flange if you wanted to, but we'll check out the performance with four blades, see how it does, and we can make a determination from there. A couple more features you might be interested in. This whole plate that you see down here kind of underneath the housing is adjustable up and down. So you have multiple bolt holes, so you can adjust this kind of skid runner to help out with your depth. And speaking of max depth, it is up to a seven inch tilling depth, which is typically unheard of on a four foot tiller. I don't really see the need to go seven inches down, but it's nice to know you can. And of course, if you didn't notice, this is quick hitch compatible. We're using the Spico Cat 1 Quick Hitch. This one does not use any bushings, all right? So we sell an absolute boatload of these things for that very reason, but you don't have to use a quick hitch. If you want to just hook it right up to your category one three-point hitch, you can do that as well. It's standard 540 RPM rear PTO. Just got the PTO shaft. Hook it up right to the back of your tractor. Have the safety chains, the shaft cover, all that good stuff too. Now something that's mentioned on this sticker on this side and maybe somewhere else as well. And just for your general information, most gearboxes these days are coming empty without any oil in there. Maybe there's just a trace film just to kind of coat the inside of the gearbox, but that's due to different shipping regulations, federal regulations that limit or don't allow at all any fluids to be shipped. And so that's the reason behind that. So it's always a good idea to check your gearboxes before you get to work. And speaking of work, we're going to get to it right now. As always, we're sponsored by Bora Wheel Spacers. They are made in America, have a lifetime warranty. If your tractor feels tippy side to side, especially if you have a cab on it, then adding a set of wheel spacers can make a big difference.

Technically, I'm probably a little early on my tilling. We're going to come back through and plant our screening cover that we have. It's a giant screen. It'll grow up to, it's over 12 foot tall in one season. You can plant it even in June and still get, I think it's over 10 foot in height. It's a crazy cool type of plant that you can get. And so we're actually a new dealer with Northwoods Whitetails who sells this product along with all sorts of food plot seeds too. So we're going to plant plots all over this place this year, get the screening cover here, closer to the road, a lot of different areas. So access to stands, that kind of thing too. Going to have a lot of fun. So if you want to see what's going on out here at the property, see more tractor videos in general, we'd love to have you tag along, hit that subscribe button.

We are coming from Sardis Road and the end of the time, as you can send in alone. all right you guys I'm gonna finish up in just a minute but these next two rows here were done over the plowing that we'd already done with the all-purpose plow so I mean these results are just so much better I don't I don't really see the need the requirement to plow before you till I mean what we did over here just tilling plowing and then tilling and then just plowing you can see the results I think speak for themselves okay we're just wrapping up just thought of it but this is the performance with four blades per flange on the tiller all right so I've always used six blades per flange there's no way you could tell the difference between four and six blade this did just as good as any six blade tiller that I've used so I think you might be able to add more blades onto this one if you needed to I don't know for sure I'll have to verify that but the way it's set up stock with four blades on each flange works pretty darn good so I'm gonna get that knocked out but if you guys are in the market for something for your tractor whether it's for the three-point hitch or the front-end loader it could be pallet forks could be a snow pusher could be a tiller could be a snow blower could be a brush hog you name it we can help check out goodworkstractors.com we do sell and ship all over the country if you enjoy watching tractor videos we'd love to have you tag along hit that subscribe button right underneath the video I want to thank you for taking time out of your day to stop by and until next time stay safe we'll see you soon too you",

        "category": " Capscum swarming in Kenya is a profitable venture. But many farmers struggle, especially during the germination stage. With the light guidance, however, you can grow Capscum from seed to harvest and make the most of these high demand vegetables. In this tutorial, we will walk you through every step from selecting the best Capscum seeds to planting, from test control to harvesting. Now we shall cover the following topics. The Capscum market in Kenya. The best time to plant Capscums in Kenya. The best soil for Capscums farming. The best Capscum variety to grow in Kenya. How to raise Capscum seedlings. Capscums planting and spacing. Capscum fertilizer application schedule. Capscums paste and control methods. And finally Capscums diseases and how to control them. The Capscum market in Kenya. Capscums enjoy a steady demand in Kenya. Particularly in the mass market and grocery stores. Brokers absorb around 70% of the total production. Making it easier for farmers to sell in bulk and secure fast revenues. Capscums prices typically range from 30 shillings to 80 shillings per kilo. Capscums fluctuating based on supply and demand. Capscums are highest during the times of extreme shortage. The best time to plant Capscums in Kenya. For the highest profits. Ideal time to plant Capscums in Kenya is February and September. This allows you to harvest during Easter and Christmas festive season when the demand is highest. Planting this month ensures your crop are ready for harvest when the prices are peak. To maintain a steady income, ensure a continuous supply by staggering your planting and harvesting times. Buyers prefer farmers who can provide consistent deliveries regardless of the season. The best soil for Capscums farming. Before investing in Capscum farming, ensure your soil is suitable. Capscums thrive in deep, fertile, well-drained room soils. Avoid planting in fertile in fields previously used for potato or tomato farming. As these crops share pests and diseases that could damage your Capscum crop. The best Capscums varieties to grow in Kenya. For better yields, choose high yield hybrid Capscum varieties. These are more resistant to diseases and pests. Here are two of the best varieties for Kenyan farmers. Number one, Maxibel. Maxibel is a popular open pollinated sweet pepper variety known for its heavy fruiting. The fruits weigh around 200 grams and each plant can yield 4 to 5 kilograms. Maxibel matures in about 90 days and has a high tolerance to tomato mosaic virus. Maxibel variety planting density or the planting population is around 900 plants per 240 square meter or 20,000 plants per acre. The second good variety for farmers is Superbale F1. Superbale is a hybrid variety with broccoli rubs and the big fleshy fruits. It has a mild flavor and high resistance to tomato mosaic virus and potato virus. Harvesting starts 65 to 75 days after transplanting. It can yield up to 25 tons per acre. How to raise Capscum seedlings? Seedlings establishment is where most farmers fail. Capscum seeds take 4 to 5 weeks to establish. However, this can be accelerated by soaking seeds in an optimizer or seed shooter solution before planting. Sow seeds shallowly and cover them with black pepper to shorten the germination period by up to 2 weeks. How to plant Capscum and the spacing? For best results, space Capscum plants 45 cm by 45 cm. This allows for 20,000 plants per acre. Use well decomposed fermiered manure and alleviate a thalary before transplanting. After transplanting, drench the plants with insecticides like thunder and a foliar feed like city shooter to protect against cutworms and other pests. Capscum fertilizer application schedule. This is how you should now apply fertilizers from planting to harvesting. On 14 days after transplanting, apply DAP to promote root and foliar growth. 14 days after transplanting, apply NPK-317 to stimulate flowering. 60 days after transplanting, apply CAN fertilizer to enhance fruit enlargement. Additionally, use nitrogen, potassium and calcium foliar fertilizers like EasyGroo Vegetative, Advanced K and Calmax to boost plant health and fruit production further. 15. Capscum Pastes and how to control them? These are the most destructive pests in Capscum farming. Number 1, lead spider mites. These are tiny pests that feed on the underside of the leaves causing yellowing and upward curling. To control them, apply profile at the rate of 10 ml per 20 liters of water or escort at the rate of 8 ml per 20 liters of water. The second pest is hot flies. The second pest is hot flies. Hot flies stack nutrients from the Capscum plants, hidden in photosynthesis. Infested leaves show white wax material and to control, apply Zander. All profile at the rate of 10 ml per 20 liters of water. The third one is cat worms. These are pests that cut seedlings near the soil level. Drench the soil with profile at the rate of 3 ml per liter or pentagon at the rate of 1 ml per liter to control them. The other one is root knot nematodes. Nematodes cause root swelling leading to reduced vigor and plant depth. Drench the soil with alonze at the rate of 0.5 ml per liter or marshall at the rate of 10 ml per 20 liters. Capscum diseases and how to control them. The most destructive disease is bright. It is caused by fungus, phytophila capsica that leads to rapid folia, fruit and root rot. To control, apply Rydermil gold at the rate of 50 g per 20 liters or mistrust at the rate of 30 g per 20 liters. The best way here is to prevent the infection. The next disease is Downy mildew. This disease causes yellow spots on the upper leaf surfaces and browning leading to leaf drop and sunburn. To prevent downy mildew, apply at least Rydermil gold at the rate of 50 g per 20 liters of water. The other disease is Fusarium wilt. Fusarium wilt is caused by Fusarium oxyspollum. This soil-borne fungus leads to vein clearing, yellowing and wilting. To control Fusarium wilt, drain the soil with absolute at the rate of 10 ml per 20 liters of water. Absolute is a fungicide. The other disease which is very very critical is Bacteria wilt. This bacterial disease causes wilting of young leaves and discoloration of vascular tissues. To control it, apply GreenCop at the rate of 2.5 g per liter, which is a copper-based product. This will tend to suppress the spread of the fungus. Capscum farming in Kenya can be highly profitable if you follow the right steps from seed selection, pest control and harvesting. With proper soil preparation, disease management and continuous harvesting, you can maximize your yields and profits throughout the year.

What we have, we're wanting to maintain a 2 to 4% slip when setting up our tractor for the proper demo. So to do that, we've got to go in and we've got to get our air pressure set properly from tire to tire. And also on the back, the proper inflation will basically put 3 bars on the ground, solid on the ground. That will be what you look for and then you can adjust from that by whatever piece of equipment that you've got on the back of the tractor. The other thing that we'll have will be proper ballasting, which is going to be our weight issues. We're going to have weights on the inside of our duals and we can set different weights for that. Plus, we'll have weights on the front of the tractor and we can do that.",

        "category": " Tractor is broke down. So anyway, want to see what we got going on? Check out the video. So guys, the burn pile has burned down good so far. We got good hot coal, so as soon as I can get the tractor going, it'll be real easy to get this back going. And we have obviously put a big dent in this, but I got no go on that. So let me tell you what happened. It's kind of a series of events. I've got two issues. So first of all, and I'm going to include this in on the end screens when we get to the end of this video. A while back, I've got a video. It's called I Messed Up, and I'm surprised that it didn't break everything then, but I'm convinced it did like 80% of the damage. So what happened was I, and again, I'll show you the video. When I was hooking up my grapple, I accidentally just forgot to put in the locking pins. I did the hydraulic lines. And anyway, I just dropped off the grapple. It pulled all the hydraulic lines very tight. I think it did a lot of damage to them, but they did not rupture. So I've been working, I don't know, last two weeks continued to use the grapple. Well, anyway, over the weekend, it finally, it finally gave up the ghost and I had a rupture. I was shooting, as I was picking up this stuff and moving it over to the burn pile, all of a sudden I started shooting a stream out of one of the hydraulic lines about two or three feet up in the air. So I immediately shut down. I went to investigate real, you know, I knew immediately what was going on, but I disconnected the hydraulic lines because I did not want to lose any more fluid. And lo and behold, when I went to crank back up, battery was dead as a doorknob, even though I had been sitting here running it for hours. So I know just the battery over time. This tractor is over six years old now. And, you know, it's time for batteries. They usually, if you get over five years, you count your blessings, right? So anyway, guys, first thing on the list is I'm going to walk you guys through putting a replacement battery in here. And I've already pulled the battery, but no, no big deal for you guys not to see that coming out. Obviously we're going to do the reverse process. And as we go, I'll tell you guys a bunch of stuff I've learned along the way. So, you know me guys, let's get busy. All right. So obviously my tractor is a 3032E. And on pretty much all of these versions of tractors, the battery is located up in the front. And so this right here just sets in a, you know, a holder and it's real easy. You can just lift this up and move this over. And this right here just lifts up and comes out of the way. And I'm going to set this over to the side and the, the battery goes right down here in the bottom and it's got a special way that it mounts in. Now, uh, one thing I want to share with you and you know, you guys can make decisions for yourself on how to do this, but this is a 22 series battery. And if you go to like advanced auto and you can see I've got, this was a John Deere. I actually went to the tractor place to get this and I'll explain why. Uh, first of all, if you go to like, and I'm not knocking the advanced autos or the auto zones, uh, they have a battery that's pretty close to the same size. But the one thing their batteries don't have is this little protrusion out on the side with this hole indention. And so you have to make a decision. Do you want to get a little bit cheaper battery that does not have this? And then this is what's used to lock the battery on the tractor in place, or you can do one without this and you got to figure out another way to strap it down and hold it into place because it's been up on the front of the motor and it is near the radiator and the intercoolers for the, for the hydraulic fluid. You don't want the battery moving around and bouncing in and breaking, you know, you just will have another thing to get tore up. So then I played the numbers game. Uh, the batteries at the advanced auto that's in the 22 series are auto zone. They're all about the same. They were anywhere from 110 to $115. I could get this battery, which is a factory replacement from John Deere. And this was just like 140 bucks. So for 20 or 30 bucks more, uh, was it worth it to me? It was because my time, I did not want to have to take time to reinvent how to strap this down. And so, uh, I just went ahead and got it. I was there, it was available and it was the exact thing I needed. So I got it. You guys obviously more welcome to make up your mind on how you want to do the fix, but that's the reason why. So anyway, that's the battery. And now let me, uh, start getting things laid out and I'll show you how we get this in place. And by the way, while we're here, these are the straps that hold down. And this is why this is so important is this strap, the way it goes. And let me get the camera here so you can see it. It, this battery, I mean, this bolt sets right up in that little groove and that's what's going to keep it from moving back and forth. So anyway, again, the decision is y'all's on how you want to play it. But anyway, let's get this in and get my girl going. All right guys. So I'm just going to ease this on down in here like so and get it set in place and make sure I'm left and right from where these holes are. All right. And then as I was stating, there's one hole to the left, one hole to the right. And this is where the challenge comes in a little bit because that has a nut on the backside and you've got to reach around. So hopefully my arms are long enough. They sure don't make this easy to get to from here. There we go. That's that side. This right here is the hard part. It's just trying to stretch around and get to the bolts. I've got an extension on the upper end holding it in place and I'm screwed that in. So now I've got them started. All I've got to do is just snug them up. Like I said, this is the fun part, but it's not too awful bad. All right. One side done. One side to go. So now you just pull up the tabs and pull the tops off. And obviously you want to make sure black to black or black to negative and red to positive. And obviously if I was at my house, I would have much better selection of tools. But this is called in the field repair. When you make out with what you got. So it might be a little slower, but we're going to get it. So you just snug these up. And hopefully here in a minute, we're going to be ready to fire this bad boy up. So if you've been watching any of my videos recently, you know that it's extremely dry here. And you also know that it's just been dusty, dusty. And boy, if that doesn't show the tail of it right there with how dirty and dusty everything is underneath. When we get home, it'll definitely be time for cleaning and replacing filters because I'm at my fall servicing anyway. And it's just time for a good cleanup, good servicing. All right. So as you saw, I just set the tray back in place and set this on top. All right, guys, here's the moment of truth. Let's see. Oh, we got all kinds of lights. That's a major improvement. And here we go. Yeah, baby. Well, guys, I owe y'all an apology. You know, when this video started, I was going to be doing two repairs. Well, in the middle of me working, something happened, which I absolutely loved. I got some surprise visitors that kind of interrupted my work. So I never got around to recording the second part of the repair. I'm sure I'm getting ready to show you what happened. And I'm sure you guys will forgive me when you see why. Get out of my way. I'm coming through. There she goes. There she goes. And Sissy's chasing. Here she comes. And there she goes. You're the best papa in the world. Well, thank you. Are you coming through? See you later. I'm at your house now. I'm swinging with two swings. There you go. There you go. Now don't you think you're a little too big for that one. Hi. I'm setting in a baby swing. Here, let's see. Hi. Hi. Hello. Bye-bye. See ya. Crazy. Well, guys, the tractor's back running great. I also did a little bit more excavator time. And this pile is just endless and keeps going and keeps going and keeps going. So what we're doing is just reaching in, pulling this stuff out, getting it to where we can work with it, cutting off what wood we can burn. And we'll continue working, try to get the stumps run down as well. For now, everything's back in action and working great. And I'll catch you on the next one, because you know here at Project Next One, there is always one more. We'll see you on the next one. Thank you. finding out next two, knowing who is in the loop of the led demo and creating this history of the development of I. It shows you on February 1, checking out whatfit that his model is designed, trying to do different other projects and sets of projects to go through. It is pretty gutsy based on this project. It is worth spending time for what to look like.",

        "category": " Music Hi, welcome to the Making Life Changes Urban Gardening Channel. My name is Harold Helm and I'm out here today to give you some great gardening tips on how you can have continual sea of green when it comes to harvesting your green leafy vegetables. Some people like to come out here and just pull your vegetables up, the whole plant, and then you got to plant new seeds. Now that works great if you have lots of land. But if you're like us and you live in the city, our suburb, or you have just a small area where you're doing what we call square foot urban gardening, you're going to be a little bit more surgically precise when it comes to harvesting so you can continue to reap harvests week after week after week. And so today we have several types of plants here. This is a Siberian kale, beautiful. You see how large it is. The leaf's very healthy. We also have dinosaur kale. And then we have red leaf lettuce and we have some spinach that we're going to be harvesting as well. And so today what we're going to do is we're going to harvest just the leaves that we want to take off the plant. We're going to leave enough leaf and foliage on the plant so the plant will grow back. If you do this, every two to three weeks you can come out here and harvest and you can continue to have a perpetual sea of green. And you're going to get so much green that you won't be able to eat it all, so you're going to have to learn how to freeze it, preserve it, maybe you can it. There's a lot of interesting ways that you can do it. So what we do is we just go around the plant. I'm going to look for the big leaves, the leaves that I know that I need to go ahead and take off. And give me a good pair of scissors or some shears. And you want to go right down here to the base. You can see this, the base of the plant. And I'm just going to cut right there at the bottom. Take this whole leaf off just like this. I'm going to collect it. Later I'm going to clean these. I've got a great video that shows you how to clean these leaves and get everything off and get them ready. So I'm just going to go around the plant and I'm going to take off all these bottom leaves. Even some of these that don't look real great because we want to remove them from the plant anyway because it's going to encourage new growth. And just work your way around the plant. Don't take the little leaves off because you want something to grow back. You're going to have some of these leaves that are going to be a little yellow. These are the leaves you can throw into your compost bin and recycle them. They're no good but you want to get them off the plant to encourage new growth. So I'm just going to go around here and take these off. And this one here I can take off too. It's a pretty good size. And there you go. And actually I can take this one other one off. It's kind of medium. I could have left it on but I'm going to go ahead and pull it. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to encourage, I'm going to leave three, four leaves on and I'm going to encourage new growth. In just two to three weeks the plant's going to be that same size and it'll be time to harvest again. And you can do the same thing with all your different green leafy vegetables with this dinosaur kale. Dinosaur kale doesn't quite get as big. It's okay. They're going to be smaller. These are really tasty, especially if you put them in a recipe like some white beans and rice and cook them in. Kale is just wonderful. It's rich in all kinds of vitamins, especially vitamin A, high in fiber, very nutritious. And it's a super food. And this one leaf down here that's kind of going bad a little bit, starting to get to yellow, you can just throw that into the compost bin. So I'm going to take this kale and clip it all the way off. So I'm going to work it all the way to the top of the plant until I get to the small leaves. Once I get to the small leaves, I am not going to mess with the small leaves. I'm going to leave the very, very small leaves on the plant to encourage new growth so the new leaves can grow back. So I'm going to leave that on there. All this is going to grow back and continue to get up. And this kale will continue to grow taller and taller and eventually will go through its lifespan. Now, red leafy vegetables, green leaf vegetables, whatever type of lettuce you like, it's the exact same thing. You just work your way around the bottom of the plant. And you really got to get in here. It's good to kind of leave yourself some space when you're working in your garden. That's why we put one plant per square foot so you can get in your garden without stepping on your plants and they're not too overcrowded. They're not too overcrowded. I definitely want to remove this bad leaves down here and throw them into the compost bin. Get all that out because it will encourage new growth. Then you just want to go around your plant. And this is one plant. All these plants that were taken from today, they actually survived the winter storm down here in the Houston area, down here in Texas. And we were very fortunate. We covered our plants. These are green hardy, winter tolerant plants. And so they survived. We did lose a few plants, but most of the plants survived. And this is what's left. And look, they grow back and we're getting amazing harvests from them. So we're going to continue to work around the plant and take off all these green leaves. And don't take them all off. You want to leave some so they grow back. And I'll show you what it looks like when we get through. These are great for sandwiches, salads, and grow really fast. So you want to come out here, you want to trim them, but if you don't take the whole plant up, they'll grow back. That's the beautiful thing about it. So there's one more leaf on the side. I'll take this one. And you just want to look to see how big they are. See this one? These are small. These are small. I want to leave them. This is small. This is still growing. There's one back over here I'll take. And this one right here. And that's it. And I'm going to leave that on there and it's going to grow back in a couple of weeks and it's going to be another big plant again. So I have a perpetual sea of green constantly harvesting from my garden. And one thing you want to do too when you take your plants in and you clean them up and you take the stems out, make sure that before you use them, that you soak them in some water, about a gallon, half gallon of water, fill your bowl up, and put you about a cap full of vinegar, regular white vinegar. And let it set for 15, 20 minutes at least. That will kill all the germs that are on the plant. So if there's any bacteria on the plant, they're not contaminated. Let me show you the spinach. Now you can see we're filling this bowl up. We're going to come back out here. We're going to get several more bowls of these filled up here as we harvest. And we're going to have to end up freezing a lot of our kale. Not the lettuce, but the kale freezes very well. And so we'll put it in storage bags and put it in the freezer and continue to have kale throughout the year. And same with spinach. Get in here so you can see this. Here's the spinach plant. Some people just go and they pull this whole plant up, but then you kill the plant. So what we're going to do is we're going to clip just right around the outside edge and take all these big leaves off. And by doing this, we're encouraging new growth. And we're using the same plant. We're not having to wait a long time for these plants to produce a new spinach plant. We're going to continue to clean everything up and take all the leaves off. And eventually we're going to be left with just some plants that have a few leaves on them. In a few weeks, they're going to grow back and we're going to have more great greens. It's going to be a perpetual sea of harvest, perpetual sea of green. And this is what we're doing here at Making Life Changes.

        "category": " I'm going to try to do this tip where you can kind of see what I'm doing here. A lot of people when they are weeding a garden they let it get out of control and then they go in and they have to spend hours weeding it and kind of a trick that I've been doing for years I only take 10 minutes every day I come out into the garden I look at an area that's got some weeds and I spend 10 minutes just cleaning up those little bit of weeds and because I do that every day the weeds don't get out of control and it's pretty easy to keep up with so I'm kind of hoping that you can learn something from this tip that really it's better off if you get the weeds before they get out of control now there's other ways you can do this it's a little bit faster sometimes I use the other methods sometimes I come out here with a hoe and I basically just smack the ground where there's a weed at to uproot it what you'll find sometimes though is you'll pull these weeds and if you pull them out roots and all they'll actually if like it's supposed to rain later today so if I pull it out roots and all and toss them on the ground you can see some old weeds right there but if I toss them on the ground what'll happen is it'll rain tonight and they'll root again you see that happen quite a bit you can see like a weed that's knocked over and I've already done a lot of this up here but it literally I can do this whole garden almost in 10 minutes because there's just not a lot and uh that just makes it very quick to walk through here and just pull whatever weeds I see and to be honest with you I haven't actually done this in about three or four days because you don't have to do it every day you might initially like if you're already behind on weeding spend about 10 minutes every day just knock a section out and then by the time that you get the whole garden done there shouldn't be near as many weeds a second time and if you just keep doing that it gets to be really easy to take care of you don't have to deal with going out there and spending all day Saturday and Sunday and you're also by doing this every day a little bit of time every day in the garden you're also better able to keep track of any type of bug or pest issues that you might have coming up you'll have to deal with because you can you can see it way easier when there's less weeds for one and also you're spending more time out in the garden which is good for the soul I guess I mean it's good for your mental health and soul and but you can see it's just this goes really fast because there's just not a lot to mess with now I'm actually getting ready to till up this place right here where I'm pulling these weeds I technically don't even have to pull these weeds I'm getting ready to till it I've got some sweet potatoes that need to plant it and I need to heal my potatoes the second time I put a video up a few days ago about healing potatoes and I need to come out here and do it the second time to get them under control because we've had so much rain again it's supposed to rain again today so now this is one area over here that I did kind of let go on the weeds that's uh carrots and peas and I'll just be honest with you it rained so much I couldn't get in here so by the time I could get in here they're just about pretty bad shape but anyways I thought I'd give you this tip how to keep weeds under control in the garden just do a little bit each day if you do a little bit each day I mean I've probably only been out here for however long this video is already weeded this area already weeded this already weeded all that already weeded all this and uh it'll be good now for three or four days and then I can focus on getting these rows the next time and uh maybe over here to the tomatoes and peppers which they're not in that bad of shape right now if you saw the onions last week before I weeded it they were in just as bad as those carrots but they're looking pretty good again so they actually need some of those need harvested I need to plant some more but uh yeah so you can kind of see I haven't done this in probably a week and there's just hardly no weeds in here even though we've had so much rain I mean there's one every now and then but it's not like they're not taking over the garden right that's kind of the point I'm trying to make if you spend just a little bit of time each day they won't take over your garden versus if you don't spend a little bit of time each day and you just let it take over your garden by the time you realize that the garden needs weeded it's a whole lot of work that you're probably going to get frustrated with and not complete in one day so then it's never going to get done it's never going to stay caught up it's always just going to be a mess so uh anyways I'm not going to keep you any longer thanks for watching as always god bless you god bless your families god bless your homesteads love of you love this girl love you oh excuse me",

        "category": " Hey y'all welcome this is Crystal from Crystal's Den and Garden aka Crystal's Den and I'm back here with you today. Last time I was here I spoke about the five mistakes I made as a beginner gardener. Today I wanted to share six tips to get your summer garden started. Let's get into it. So the first tip I have is choosing your spot and considering how much space you have to work with. When choosing a spot make sure to choose one that gets lots of good sun. Most crops need about four to eight hours of sun a day so we want to make sure our spot can accommodate that. We also want to consider how much like space we want to use for gardening. Some plants like tomatoes and oak will grow really tall and bushy. Other plants like squash and watermelon are going to vine out really long. So just think about and consider how much space you can have for your garden and how much you can give for your crops. My second tip is choosing the crops that you want to grow. This may seem like a no-brainer but I wanted to give a couple pieces of advice or give a couple tips on some crops that you could choose. One think about native plants. So what's native to your area? How can you create a nice ecosystem of plants that you know can thrive where you live? Also think about companion planting. Companion planting is something that I like to do and that I kind of that's kind of the way that I situate my garden. That's just when you plant plants together that can really benefit from each other and grow well together and you keep ones that don't grow too well together far away. Some complaining planting that I have going on right now are my tomato and basil which both enhance the flavor for each other. My sage and tomato. Sage helps the growth of the tomato. I have some jalapeno with my squash and cucumbers and pumpkins because they help those vegetables not develop root rot. And then I have geraniums and marigolds spread throughout my garden to kind of keep away different pests since they don't like the smell. So all of that is some examples of companion planting and what I'm doing and just kind of something that you can consider as well. And then also make sure you have some really great pollinators in the garden. Some pollinators that I have going are sunflowers, echinacea, marigolds, geraniums, nasturtiums to name a few. Those pollinators are going to help bring the bees out and get that pollination process going and continued. So just think about that when you're choosing the vegetables you want to grow. The third tip I give is think about the medium that you want to grow your vegetables in. What are you going to grow them in? Are you going to do a container garden? Are you going to be growing in the ground? Are you going to be doing raised beds? Think about how you're going to grow all of your crops and what that best looks like for you and your dwelling. That leads me to the soil. Choosing your soil. When I was first starting out gardening, I kind of thought I could use any old type of soil. I remember going and buying a big bag of in-ground soil and thinking I could put it in my raised bed. Well, yeah, that part of my raised bed did not turn out so well and I didn't get the best like result with that because I put in-ground soil in the raised bed. So make sure you're getting the right soil. If you're doing gardening in the ground, you'll need like a soil amendment. So something to add nutrients to the soil. If you are doing containers or raised beds, you'll need the raised bed or container soil. Go to your local nursery. Let them help you. I've gone plenty of times to my local nursery or seed store. Ask them what's some really good soil to use for the different type of gardening that I'm doing and they've been really helpful. So let that also be a way to help and guide you too. Fifth tip is getting a good watering system going. I like to have water in the morning or in the late evening. Try to avoid watering in the middle of the day, especially if you live in a super hot climate because then the water is just going to evaporate and your plants won't get that good nourishment. So get you a good watering schedule. Figure out what's best for you. Figure out what's best for your crops, how often they need to be watered and you know, kind of like let that guide you. And then my sixth tip is just have fun, beloved. Don't give up. You can do this. There will be obstacles. There will be failures. There will be things that go wrong. It's okay. It's part of the process. It's how we grow and learn. Last year, all my corn got destroyed by a horrible wind. This year, I have something eating my cabbages and I keep losing cabbages left and right. And you know, there will probably be other stuff happening too. But it's part of the process. It's how we learn. It's how we grow. So don't give up. Keep the course. You can do this. You got this. And yeah, have fun with it. Okay. Thank you so much y'all for watching this. I hope those six tips helped you and our, you know, encouragement for you to get your summer garden started. Thank you again for watching.

        "category": " Looks like we got a problem Houston. My wheel fell off. I didn't even realize it until it fell off. Reason being, the bearings disintegrated because I drove it in the pond a couple times last year to rescue some stuck cars and trucks. Well, as I mentioned before, water and wheel bearings kills them. So I've got the axle shaft on the spindle all cleaned off. I've got the bearing hole cleaned out on both sides and the grease and broken bearing bits out. Now I have to show you how to get a wheel bearing off, or the pieces. This is the same as you do it for like, for example, the rear of a car. Or if it's a rear-wheel drive car, how to get the wheel bearings out of the front rotors. Luckily for me, when you have a tractor, it has the option of lifting up any wheel you want to, you know, so you don't have to use a jack. Cool. So, first thing you notice, we're now looking at the back side of the wheel, the big bearing. It has a notch in the hub on both sides. That's your removal notch. I'll show you how that works. You get a steel bar or a big bolt with a flat end on one end. Then you flip your wheel or tire over, so that the bearing hub is facing towards the ground. Now you use your big hammer, steel bar, drop it down each notch, give a few taps on one side, then a few taps on the other side, and keep tapping back and forth with your hammer until you knock the bearing out. Save the old piece of bearing, you need it to reinstall the new one. So you hold your steel bar at an angle like that, and start whacking. That only took about eight whacks. And my bearing piece is out. Oh! There it is. Now put that aside for reinstallation to put the new one in. There's your new parts. The new piece we've got to press in. New bearing hub and race. And axle dust seal. So, just make sure there's a bit of grease around the surface, and set that in the hole, with the widest portion always facing out. Then you set the wheel flat on the ground. Clean off this piece of shit. And you use this to reinstall the bearing, and you also put it in with the widest piece facing outwards. Then you put a block of flat steel or something on it, and tap it in with the hammer. Now I have a perfect installation tool. Set that on there. Maybe that way works better. And start whacking. You have to tap it evenly to get it down square. Perfect. Gotta love it. Now with the same method on the other side. Use your flattened end steel bar. Catch the ridge of the other bearing. And knock it out. Pack the sucker with lots of grease. And with your hands, pack that with lots of grease too. Of course, it's got a big cavity in there to hold grease. And you're all set for installation. The inner part of the bearing is in the hole. Now pre-grease the rubber part of the new seal. And install it. And tap it on square two. Well, got the other part of the bearing packed and ready for installation. Put the washer on. And your big, called a castellated nut. Castellated part always goes outwards. Then the first setting you make it is a little bit tight. Then you rotate the wheel a few times. Shut it off. Then I back the bearing off to make it a little bit tight. Then I back the bearing off to make it a little bit tight. Then I back the bearing off to make it looser. So the first cotter key hole lines up. I put the cotter key in. And then I back the bearing off to make it a little bit tight. Then I back the bearing off to make it looser. So the cotter key hole lines up. I put the cotter key in. Then the end. And that's how you set the wheel bearing. To have the right amount of plug in. And then the first setting you make it. And then you're big. And then you're big. Called a castellated nut. The castellated part always goes outwards. Then the first setting you make it is a little bit tight. Then you rotate the wheel a few times. Shut it off. Then I back the bearing off to make it looser. So the first cotter key hole lines up. I put the cotter key in. Bend the end. And that's how you set the wheel bearing. To have the right amount of play. Which is almost no play. But you never run it with a tight wheel bearing. Or it'll get hot. It'll burn it out. So now time to put the dust cap on. And we're all done.",

        "category": " So I run a half acre vegetable farm in northern Wyoming. I have 80 50 foot by two and a half foot beds that grow two to three crops a year. So I have a lot of weeds to deal with and a lot of crops to deal with. So in order to maintain all of that I have to have systems to make it go really really fast, really really efficiently, and those same systems can work in your 220 or 250 square foot garden at home. So the first thing that I like to do is go around the entire garden and pull everything I consider to be a perennial weed. What that means is it's a weed that has to be pulled out by the taproot with something like a weed hook or a digging fork and especially things like grass, dandelions, you know some of these I don't even know the names of because I've just done it so many times I know that I can't cultivate them. Find weed and get them with the digging fork and with the tap for with the taproot intact and get them in a bucket and get them out of the garden because every one of these that you pull now will not grow back and this is how over time your garden becomes weedless and a lot less work. This is brand new soil. I just started growing in it in August and it's now May so it's not even a year old so there's quite a bit of these perennial weeds. You're kind of going to have to figure out which ones are perennial in your area. You can do some research with your local extension agency but if you do this a little bit every week you're going to be in really good shape in a year. In two years it's going to be an immaculate garden so this little bit of effort on your hands and knees once in a while is going to save you a ton of bending over in the future. Now another tip for keeping your garden weedless is cultivating instead of pulling by hand so using a tool like this cull in your hoe or a stirrup hoe or any of the hoes that are available. There's a million different hoes out there. I'm not making a joke there that's just you know I have to use that term. There's a million hoes out there and any of them will work. You know the idea is just getting the weeds when they're really really small like this is kind of past due this is too big but I'm really going for weeds that are about the size of a quarter or smaller and they're much easier to tackle that way. So this is much easier than being on your hands and knees all day. This greenhouse is 1600 square feet your garden is probably only 200 250 square feet if that. This takes me about a half an hour to cover the entire greenhouse with this technique versus being on my hands and knees. If I was sitting there pulling weeds like this you know I'd be in here all day. So it's way faster way less work to cultivate your weeds instead of pulling them by hand like I just did. All I got to do with this is get underneath them the weeds will be turned upside down and they will die in the sun. That little root will die in the sun and you have to know your weeds too. You know you do this with dandelions it's not going to work. You have to do it with stuff that will die in the sun really really quickly but this saves you a truckload of work. And again this is really new soil and new ground so there's a lot more weeds in here than normal but over time just becomes less and less work. Another tip for keeping your garden weedless is planting in perfectly straight rows. See these two beds of carrots here. I use a special tool to draw a grid on the beds perfectly straight end to end. It makes it really easy to do that cultivating stuff where I'm just running a hole up and down these beds and all the weeds have been turned over just like this and they will die in the sun. Makes it go really really fast. Also if you plant with perfect plant spacing every single time that's very consistent and in a grid pattern like this cabbage you see here you're going to have a lot easier time getting that hole up and down the rows and in between the plants and you have access to every square inch of the bed so you can kill all the weeds without bending over. Perfect plant spacing every time is a must for keeping your garden weed free. I have a whole other video about that that I'll put right here. Another tip is using this black stuff called weed mat all around your garden to stop weeds from growing in between the outside and the inside of your garden and all it does is it stops light from hitting the plants. They die over time and water comes through so you don't have big puddles but this is really cheap. You can buy it on you just google weed barrier and you'll be able to put it all around the perimeter of your garden so you have a nice barrier from the outside where the seeds weed seeds are coming up and blowing in and it makes it a lot easier because you have a lot less weeds growing right next to all your plants that you want to harvest. So the most important of all these tips is doing a little bit of all of the stuff that I mentioned every week. Doing a little bit of consistent effort every week is a lot better than doing it all at once when you have giant bushes of weeds in July. If you just spend 15-10 minutes in your garden doing all the stuff that I talked about every week it'll be a lot less painful eventually it'll turn into five minutes or two minutes but as you get better at this and consistently do it it's a lot easier to manage. This whole high tunnel or caterpillar tunnel is brand new it took me an hour and 45 minutes to do all the things I mentioned in 1600 square feet and that's because the perennials are really bad in here still there's still a lot of grass that I have to pull every time. I bet you by the end of the year it'll take me a half an hour to do the whole 1600 square feet and so I do this every week on the farm uh on a half acre of growing space which is a lot more than 220 square feet and that's how we keep the all the crops looking as good as they are and the weeds as little as they are. So hope you enjoyed that and I'll see you in the next one. you you you you you you",

        "category": " Do you want to learn how to grow maize more sustainably? To get started, select the best maize variety and create a crop calendar for next season with extension officers in your area. Buy certified seeds, accessible at the agro-dealer, recommended by the Agri-Business Hubs. The right varieties match local climate and are adapted to low soil fertility. For commercial production, use hybrid varieties that have high yield and are disease tolerant. You can still use open pollinated local varieties. These are often tastier and easier to store due to their hard grains. In high rainfall areas, Agricultural Region 3, use late maturity varieties planted at the beginning of the rainy season between 1st and 30th November. Use medium maturity varieties between 1st and 25th December. Use early maturity varieties from 25th December to 5th January. In medium rainfall areas, Agroecological Region 2A and Agroecological Region 2B. If you only have late maturity varieties, plant them very early, before 20th November. Use medium maturity varieties between 20th November to 15th December. Use early maturity varieties between 15th to 25th December. In low rainfall areas, Agroecological Region 1. Use early maturity varieties at the beginning of the rainy season between 15th November to 15th December. Planting before rainy season is risky. Too little rainfall? Poor soil moisture will lead to poor germination and loss of seed. Every 3 to 4 years, test soil acidity and magnesium through the help of Extension officers 3 to 6 months before planting. This test is especially important in high rainfall areas where soils are naturally acidic. To make sure your soil restores a pH of 5.5 to 7, apply lime 3 weeks before planting. A field with plenty of crop residues will help the soil to stay in place, retain water, and become more fertile. In order to achieve the benefits of crop residue retention, discuss with your community and make resolutions to improve crop residue management and control grazing. Further to crop residue retention, use of cover crops, agroforestry, and livestock manure can all contribute towards improved soil fertility and the sustainable production of maize. Recommendations from Extension officers, project staff, and or the agribusiness hubs on suppliers can help you access the right equipment to manage your needs. Based on your farm size and available resources, field Extension officers recommend the best mechanization systems for you. For best yields, consider planting depth, density, and spacing. In good rainfall areas with fertile soils and proper nutrient management, aim for 4 to 5 plants per square meter, 44,000 to 55,000 plants per hectare. In areas with low rainfall and or limited application of nutrients, aim for 3 to 4 plants per square meter, 33,000 to 40,000 plants per hectare. Choosing the distance between plants depends on the equipment and amount of labor available. Here is a maize spacing guide. Here is a fertilizer and manure compost application rate guide. If you are using a jab planter, plant one seed per station for optimum yield. Limited labor? Plant up to 3 seeds in the same station. If you are using furrow planting, plant each seed at equal distance. Check the field regularly until week 6. If there are weeds, lightly scratch the surface with a hand hoe, hand weeder, or a cultivator. If you want to use herbicides, you must be trained on how to select nozzles and calibrate sprayers by qualified staff. You can receive more information from Extension officers and the Hub. If you are using chemical fertilizer, 4 weeks after planting, apply urea 20 centimeters away from the plant. Covering the urea with soil will help reduce nitrogen loss from volatilization in dry weather and runoff during heavy rain. Where possible, the top dressing should be combined with weeding, either using a hole or cultivator. If you are using minimum tillage practices, use spot application and cover the area with a hole. Or make a 10 centimeter deep hole with a stick. Place the urea in the hole and cover. Loam soil? Apply all the urea at week 4. Sandy soil? Apply half of the urea at week 4 and apply the rest at week 7. Harvest can be done by hand or you can ask the Hub where services are available.

It is now for me to harvest my baby green spinach. And as you can see, it is really healthy and it is ready to be harvested. So I just wanted to take you along and show you how to harvest baby green spinach in containers. Now there are two different ways you can harvest baby green spinach. You can actually cut it from the outside and work your way inward. But, oh my goodness, it would take forever for me to harvest each leaf and work my way inward. Or another way to harvest is just to cut it right off at the top like this. Now you don't want to cut it too far from the base because you want to come again. So this is going to be cut and come again. And as you can see, I still am leaving a base in the container as I'm harvesting the spinach. And I'm dropping a few on the ground. And you can see some of the baby spinach is still being left. And this is a quicker way. So I'm going to go ahead and harvest all this. And again, this is a quicker way to harvest the baby green spinach. And I did not cut it all the way down at the base because I want to be able to harvest my baby green spinach again. So if you would look inside the container and you can see there's still a lot of the stems left, which will allow the spinach to grow again. So here's my first harvest of the baby green spinach. And I am growing baby green spinach, which is a cool season crop in the dead of summer. And you would ask, how am I doing this? Let me show you. I have a screen that I put over the container like this. And I have two large stakes on the end, very thin. That I hold up. And then I curl these down and clip them. And then I also clip the sides over here. This container of baby green spinach only gets morning sun. About 11 o'clock, my patio is no longer receiving sun. So it's getting morning sun and it's getting filter sun. It's allowing me to grow a cool season crop in the middle of the summer. It is now on July 1st. And as you can see, I just have a large bowl of spinach that I just harvest. Another benefit of using a shade mesh cover is it keeps the insects off the spinach. The airwigs, the butterflies that want to lay their eggs on the brassica crops. It serves many purposes. And so it allows me to be able to harvest, grow and harvest baby green spinach for the remainder of the summer. I have about another week before this spinach grows again and allows me to harvest. And hopefully I may be able to get a third harvest before the end of the season. So hopefully in the next seven days, I should have another container full of spinach. And therefore I am going to fix a spinach salad for dinner tonight. I hope you enjoyed the tips. Thank you for watching. And don't forget to hit the like button. Bye. Bye.",

        "category": " All over the world, rice is a staple food of the people. Over the last 20 years, rice production in Africa has increased by 4% per annum. But consumption has increased faster. So Africa is forced to import large quantities of rice. Imported rice can be rice that has been produced 5 years ago. So the time imported rice is produced in the moment we eat it in Benin will take at least 5 years. So this rice is old compared to the local rice. Therefore, my choice is made. I prefer living rice. Rice is produced in Benin. We can be sure this rice has all the qualities we are looking for in rice. That is, all the nutritional values. Even though the rice produced in Africa often has superior cooking characteristics to the imported rice, several practices reduce the quality. To convince African consumers to eat local rice, it is imperative to prevent deterioration in quality. Among the factors affecting rice quality are varietal mixture, harvest date, impurities such as stones, and drying and storage conditions. Here, we will learn how to avoid devaluing the local rice. To ensure good quality rice, you must start right from sowing, by avoiding the use of a mixture of varieties. The chairman of Central Benin's Rice Farmers Union stresses why this is important. When one wants to grow rice, they go to the market, or they buy rice from the neighbour, or from any source. So there is already a mixture of varieties in the field. When this mixture is milled, depending on the calibration of the grader, if this is large, the finest grains pass through without being de-hust, and the biggest grains will be broken before coming out of the machine. Because you take a mixture to the miller, you can be sure you'll get a heterogeneous rice. That's obvious. So the seed problem must be solved. And producers have to learn that rice is not like maize, where yellow, red, white grains can all be mixed. But rice, it needs to be selected. The rice field needs to be divided into plots, according to varieties, so that it makes milling easy and effective. This is very important. This seed is from a single variety. It's only from this type of seed, that a homogenous harvest can be obtained. And therefore, there's a standard product after milling. The picture on the right shows a mixture of varieties. With such seed, we obtain a harvest that turns out a poor product after milling. The picture on the right shows a mixture of varieties. With such seed, we obtain a harvest that turns out a poor product after milling. So it's very important to avoid mixing varieties right from sowing. It's also recommended to separate the various varieties immediately after harvest, to thresh them and store them separately. Because just a seed is a mixture of varieties. The picture on the right shows a mixture of varieties. With such seed, we obtain a harvest that turns out a poor product after milling. So it's very important to avoid mixing varieties right from sowing. It's also recommended to separate the various varieties immediately after harvest, to thresh them and store them separately. Because during milling, a mixture produces a non-standard product. Apart from high amounts of unmilled and broken grains, mixtures are also hard to cook. Because each variety has its own cooking time. So to satisfy the consumer, avoid mixing the varieties at all stages. Harvesting at the right time also helps maintain the quality of the final product. When we harvest too early, the paddy contains a lot of green grains. And during milling, they turn into flour. In this way you lose a lot of rice and therefore a lot of money. Rice production demands a lot of work. And without care, we cannot obtain a good product. The harvest must not be delayed until the panicles are too dry. Because during milling, the overdrive paddy will only produce broken grains. The right harvesting time for rice is generally five weeks after flowering, or five weeks after the appearance of the panicle, which is a characteristic easily detectable by farmers. At this stage, also the colour in the grains change. The green will turn straw-like, yellow or even gold, depending on the variety. And generally, when 80% of the field has changed colour, we can start harvesting. To ensure good quality rice, ensure you harvest at the right time. During threshing, stones and other impurities can get in. To avoid this, prepare a clean threshing floor. It may be a tarpaulin, bags sewn together, a cemented or compacted floor. Farmers in Bangladesh even thresh on a table enclosed by bags sewn together. Threshing can be done by several methods. Manually, or the use of pedal and power threshers. Regardless of the method used, threshing must always be done on a clean floor. Let's hear about an innovative example of hand threshing. Some farmers in the Wayme Valley gather the panicles and thresh them on a barrel inside a mosquito net calmly. And the grains will not escape. They stay in the net. This is an initiative of a farmer who doesn't have a thresher. So, to avoid the contact with the soil and other debris, they spread the nets and thresh in them. After threshing, carefully pick the grains and winnow them on a clean floor. Winnow the paddy several times and make sure no weed seeds remain. After cleaning the paddy of all impurities, it's important to dry it on a clean floor. We use the tarpaulin to dry the paddy to prevent stones from getting in. Avoid drying on the bare floor or by the roadside, because stones and other impurities can get in. Now this is here from the director of the Songhai Centre, an NGO involved in rice sector development in Africa. Quality rice could be sold twice the price. So, it is very, very important for them to invest themselves in producing rice of quality. Making sure the sand is not there, the unrived rice is not there, so that the consumer who is becoming more and more demanding will like to go. Now that we have learnt how to avoid mixing varieties, to harvest at the right time and to avoid impurities, let's see what effect the water content has on the grains during milling. Grains that are too dry have cracks and break during milling. The cracks are so small that they can't be seen with the naked eye. This phenomenon is comparable to clay cracking in the sun. When the rice is too dry, it breaks. That's why it's tested every time by rubbing it in the palms of the hands. In this way, we avoid drying it too much. If the sun is too high, dry the rice for only a few minutes. We avoid the dry and dry the rice for only a few hours in the open air. Turn over the paddy from time to time to dry it evenly. And if possible, continue to dry it afterwards in the shade. Dry until the grains have an acceptable moisture content. Let's see how women in a Benin village test this. To know that the paddy is dry, we take some and rub it between the palms of our hands. We also test it with our teeth. When it breaks through the dry crack, then the paddy is dry. It's a lot of dry. And if you think that after proper drying the quality is guaranteed, no way. Storage also determines the quality of the rice. Because during storage, the paddy can become moist again. When the paddy is stored directly on a cement floor, it absorbs moisture and then goes mouldy. When the paddy is kept in a bag and stored on dry wood, its conservation is good. And it doesn't go mouldy. As we've just heard from an experienced trader, you should always store paddy on materials that support and isolate it from the ground. Avoid storing bags on rusted iron. Also, leave a gap between the bags to allow air to circulate and make pest control easier. As we saw, the quality of the rice improves when we avoid varietal mixtures and impurities. We must also harvest at the right time and ensure good drying and paddy storage. Handling the paddy well before milling helps to avoid huge losses and ensures quality. As you may well be aware by now, good quality rice requires commitment and a lot of discipline. It is important for we Africans to really invest ourselves in quality production. That culture of success, culture of quality is very important for us to push back all the dumping from outside. If we don't do it, whether it's African, whether it's from my mother's kitchen, people are not going to buy it. So we have to come to the left to be competitive. We have to develop competitive advantage. And quality is the most important element in competitive advantage. And it's at our reach, within our reach, we can do it. African rice has excellent nutritional and cooking characteristics. To ensure that the final product is attractive to the consumer, its quality must be guaranteed at all times. Rice farmers, traders, processors and consumers, we all have everything to gain from protecting the quality of our rice.
