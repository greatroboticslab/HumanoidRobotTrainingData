            "task": "Performed a multi-faceted planting and crop rotation schedule on a small organic farm in central Iowa.",
            "subtasks": [
                "Described leasing and managing four acres of land for farming, with two acres in production.",
                "Sold produce from CSA shares, farmers markets, online farm stand, and wholesale.",
                "Operated under organic management principles, though not currently certified, with a farm that has evolved over 10 years.",
                "Presented visual and spatial farm layout, highlighting intensive market garden beds versus broad acre plastic cultivation.",
                "Implemented varied crop rotation strategies, considering family-related rotations, disease management, and soil health.",
                "Employed intensive cultivation methods in short beds (e.g., hand-till, organic mulch, overhead irrigation) versus mechanized no-till techniques in long beds.",
                "Utilized plastic mulch for high-value crops with drip irrigation, adapting cultivation practices due to limited farm equipment.",
                "Managed high tunnels for multi-season production (spring greens, summer tomatoes, fall greens), adjusting rotations based on tunnel capacity and single tunnel availability.",
                "Handled seed germination and weed control using controlled irrigation, mulch, and manual cultivation techniques.",
                "Addressed record-keeping and planning through detailed crop rotation spreadsheets and historical field maps.",
                "Adapted to market demands and production levels by selectively growing and dropping certain crops, focusing on profitable and well-suited varieties.",
                "Addressed cover crop management, integrating no-till practices and compost applications to maintain soil health across various cropping rotations."
