Then, they talk about bolting on a side hook and a chain. So first task would be setting up the stanchion, with subtasks like bolting in cross bars, attaching chains, etc. But wait, is the stanchion being rebuilt? The person says, \"beef this up that way it is ready for her to go buck wild,\" so maybe they are enhancing an existing structure. But maybe the original stanchion wasn't very secure, leading to the need for improvements. So MAINTASK: Prepare a stanchion for a cow named Allie.",
