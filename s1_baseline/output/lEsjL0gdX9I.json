Let me read the part where the speaker talks about the recognition aspect. She says it might seem trivial, but for generations, women have been unpaid labor unrecognized as farmers. So their access to inputs, technologies, credit made them into recognized farmers. So key elements here are their path from unrecognized labor to recognized farmers, through adopting technologies. So that's a key storyline. Therefore, MAINTASK could beWomen farmers' journey from unrecognized labor to recognized farmers through technology adoption.",
