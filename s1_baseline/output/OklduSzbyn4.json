That should be my first MAINTASK. The person is in their raised bed garden, and they already have some cover crops (peas and oats) that they're going to use as mulch. First, they need to broadcast the cover crop, which is planting it by scattering. Then, they crimp it down using a tomato stick. After that, they use a tarp to kill the cover crop. So that's the cover crop subtask. Then, after two weeks, they remove the tarp, clean the area, add wood chips and compost, and plant the zucchini and marigolds. So, breaking down the planting into subtasks.",
