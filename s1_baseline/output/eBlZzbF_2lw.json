                "After analyzing the transcript, I've generated a list of physical and observational tasks that students perform as part of a crop scouting competition at the University of Kentucky's Research and Education Center. These tasks include rotating through various stations, such as soil properties and weed identification, scouting corn growth stages, interacting with agricultural experts, and gaining practical experience in pest management. The mention of the research center\u2019s environment and comfort on that day provides context but is secondary to the main activities. The transcript is relevant to agricultural tasks, so the final answer is constructed with the appropriate tasks and subtasks categorized under MAINTASK and SUBTASK headings. Additionally, the transcript's focus on education and interaction justifies the inclusion of tasks related to both active participation and observation in agricultural practices."
