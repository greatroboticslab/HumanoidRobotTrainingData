Since using the Node.js is a primary component, perhaps keeping the tasks as accessing the system, activating zones, verifying flow, switching sources, and testing safety valves, is accurate. However, the assignment says the transcript should be parsed into a series of tasks based on the video, which implied to focus primarily on the control and testing aspects. Hence, the suggested final answer with MAINTASK \"Test and control a garden irrigation system\" and subtasks as per the list above may be acceptable.",
