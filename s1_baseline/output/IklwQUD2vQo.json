Like observing for active labor, preparing a clean area, helping with positioning, cleaning the baby's airways. Cleaning the nose is a specific step. Then feeding time is another MAINTASK. That has subtasks of setting up food, making sure the babies are nursing, and possibly helping them if the mother isn\u2019t. Also, monitoring the mother's care for the babies. And then dealing with the family being there might be a MAINTASK of its own, but maybe it's part of just general caretaking? Like needing to balance helping the goats and being with family.",

            "task": "But let me check if all of that makes sense. The transcript mentions \"clean spot to be delivered,\" so setting that up. Then, \"I'm going to wipe off the airways and put it up by her face\"\u2014that's a subtask of assisting the birth. Also, mentioning \"first feeding the first night\"\u2014so the next day, checking on them. So that's a MAINTASK of checking on the kids the next day. But overall, the main tasks are related to the goat birth and care. But is there any farming-related tasks besides animal care? Like maybe setting up feed or supplies? Hmm, the transcript mentions getting puppy pads and towels, which for the birthing area. Setting up those supplies is a task. Or maybe the family gathering is an event, but I think the core tasks here are animal farming-related.",
