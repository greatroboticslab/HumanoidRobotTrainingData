Give only tasks and subtasks that are related to farming, agriculture, or operating farming equiptment. However, if you feel that the transcript has nothing to do with the tasks of performing physical farming, husbandry, or agricultural tasks, then say !!!TRANSCRIPT\\_IRRELEVANT: all caps, with 3 exclamation points at the beginning, followed by the reason for the video being irrelevant. Do not forget to include the reason after the colon if the video transcript is irrelevant. The entire transcript must be irrelevant.
