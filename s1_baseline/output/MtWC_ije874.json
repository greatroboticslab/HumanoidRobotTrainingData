So the main task I need to identify is teaching the audience about crop rotation and its benefits. That's the MAINTASK.",

The subtasks would include explaining what crop rotation is (like a soil vacation with varied crops), how different crops affect soil nutrients (nutrient cycling, root systems), benefits such as pest/weed control, soil health improvement, and then encouraging the audience to implement it and wish them well.",
