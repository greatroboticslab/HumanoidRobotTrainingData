This involves understanding the concept (SUBTASK 1) and recognizing its benefits like soil health, pest control, and yield improvement (SUBTASK 2). Specific crops like corn, beans, and weeds are noted for rotation (SUBTASK 3), with adjustments to planting schedules (SUBTASK 4) to cycle different crops. The goal is to prevent nutrient depletion and pest build-up (SUBTASK 5) while enhancing soil structure through varied root systems (SUBTASK 6). Additionally, understanding how crops affect soil nutrients (SUBTASK 7), the role of natural pest deterrence (SUBTASK 8), and improving soil through diverse crops (SUBTASK 9) are key ecological practices."
