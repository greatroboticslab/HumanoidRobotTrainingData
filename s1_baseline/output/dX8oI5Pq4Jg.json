Then several subtasks: researching the best candidates, selecting the plants, preparing the soil, planting each type, caring for them over time (watering, mulching, monitoring, harvesting). Each of those could be broken down further. Since the main focus is on the transformative aspect and the ease of maintenance, preserving excess produce might also be a part of the process. So preserving asparagus harvest, for example, is a subtask.",
