            "task": "Given the transcript of a fruit entomologist discussing strawberry pest management, create a list of tasks related to physical farming activities including monitoring, chemical applications, cultural controls, and pollinator management.",
            "subtasks": [
                "Monitoring two-spotted spider mite population by checking 10-5 mid-tier leaflets per acre under 10x magnification, applying miticides when thresholds are met (e.g., 5 mites per leaflet early in the season, 10 during fruiting).",
                "Using Southeast Small Fruit Consortium strawberry IPM guide for pesticide selection and application timings.",
                "Applying miticides such as Acromite, Vigilant, Canemite, Nialta, Portal, Agrimac, MP, horticultural oils, or predatory mites for spider mite control.",
                "Employing bait buckets or placing sticky red cards to monitor sap beetle populations and removing ripe or damaged fruit regularly.",
                "Implementing Thrips management strategies, including using Rotationalan, Chlorantraniliprole (Assail), Acetamiprid (Ciba), or biocontrol options like Azera and microtrol, along with cultural controls like mulching and sanitation.",
                "Managing spotted wing Drosophila (SWD) through monitoring with red sticky traps, chemical applications (e.g., spinosad, pyrifos-based products, organophosphates), mechanical controls (e.g., exclusion nets, vacuuming, culling), and sanitation (prompt removal of overripe fruit).",
                "Utilizing semi-permanent exclusion nets to prevent SWD infestation, choosing between overhead or under-tree drip irrigation for moisture management, and mulching to reduce humidity and larval survival.",
                "Adjusting harvesting frequency to remove ripe fruit promptly and implementing post-harvest treatments (36\u00b0F for 3 days) to kill SWD larvae.",
                "Selecting appropriate insecticides for worm and aphid control during planting and early growth stages, following recommended timing and application rates.",
                "Monitoring flower thrips, slugs, snails, and fire ants, employing cultural controls, baits, and integrated management strategies as needed.",
                "Developing and maintaining pollinator habitats, providing flowering resources, and minimizing pesticide exposure to support bee populations for improved strawberry pollination.",
                "Monitoring beneficial insect populations through periodic surveys and adjusting pesticide applications to protect natural enemies when possible.",
                "Adhering to resistance management practices for SWD and other pests by rotating insecticide classes and using multiple control strategies.",
                "Staying informed with resources like the Southeast Small Fruit Consortium guide and IPM app for up-to-date pest management information and best practices."
