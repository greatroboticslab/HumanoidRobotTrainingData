Then they mention that irrigation uses 70% of withdrawn water, so there's a SUBTASK: discussing the significance of irrigation in water usage for agriculture. The challenge is producing more food with limited water, so that's the SUBTASK: highlighting the challenge of sustainable food production with limited water resources.",

Is there a subtask related to that? Maybe describing how they use these tools? That could be a SUBTASK: explaining the use of crop models and GIS in studying factors affecting crop growth.",

Could break this into separate subtasks. For example, when increasing water supply, the yield doesn't increase much\u2014it's a SUBTASK: explaining the limited impact of water supply on yield. Then when increasing fertilizer, the yield jumps\u2014so a SUBTASK: showing the significant impact of fertilizer on yield. Then mention the range of yield remains inconsistent, which could be a different point. Maybe the SUBTASK is: discussing the instability in yield even with sufficient resources. Then the conclusion that combining water and fertilizer leads to stable yields\u2014another SUBTASK: explaining the combined effect of water and fertilizer for stable yield.",

Which would then allow the region to become self-sufficient or even export. So maybe that's a SUBTASK: discussing the potential of sub-Saharan Africa as a food supplier if yields are increased. Then mention virtual water and international trade. The fact that traded food accounts for 15% and carries virtual water\u2014maybe a SUBTASK: explaining the concept of virtual water and its role in international trade."
