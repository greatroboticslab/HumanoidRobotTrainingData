            "task": "raising seedlings, transplanting them into the fields. That's part of the planting process. Water management is crucial; the land is mountainous, so maybe they use terrace farming. The fields are made to slope, which is a subtask: land preparation for terracing. Then, once the rice is growing, there's weed control, monitoring for pests and diseases, harvesting. Drying the rice after harvest is also a task, but maybe that's less physical. Another MAINTASK is preserving traditional rice varieties. The transcript mentions a gene bank with 13,000 traditional varieties, so collecting and storing seeds would be a task. That's more of a farm management task. But farmers might still be using traditional methods, like seed selection and saving. So subtasks there could be: collecting seed, storing in a corn room (maybe like a grain storage), and probably supporting gene banks. Another aspect is training. The project has a training center. The farmers are being trained on new methods. So that's a task: training farmers on new agronomy practices. That would involve demonstrations, maybe classroom teaching, practical sessions. The transcript mentions \"how to collect rice for reserve in the corn room\" \u2013 that sounds like a specific skill. Maybe that's part of the training. Adapting to challenging environments \u2013 in the transcript, they mention upland farming, where fields are made on mountainsides. That's an important aspect. So there might be a subtask of constructing terraces. The text says the farmers make the fields slope across mountainsides. So making fields on mountain slopes is a skill. Then, managing those irrigate. Dams or whatever they use to water the terraced fields. But maybe that's more in the water management. There's talk about rice self-sufficiency. It's been achieved since 1999, but the coverage is only 6.8 months. So that indicates there might be unstable yields. So maintaining soil fertility probably is a task. The farmers are using modern varieties, so maybe there's a task involving that, like selecting the right variety for the season. The rice varieties here are \"moderate-duration,\" so managing the growth period. But I think how the farmers manage that is part of the agronomy. They might have another task adapting the varieties to the local conditions. Also, the land is subject to drought and flooding, so there's maybe flood control or drought resistance methods. But not sure if they mention that in the transcript. Another thing: the farmers are dealing with low self-sufficiency, only 6.8 months. So increasing production would be important. Therefore, the farmers might have tasks related to intensifying their farming practices. Like using fertilizers, which is common in rice agriculture. Although the emphasis here seems to be on modern varieties and breeding, so perhaps tasks like monitoring for pests and applying pesticides. Though the transcript didn't mention that. But since the problem is food self-sufficiency, especially rice, which is 70% of calories, then tasks related to yield improvement are prevalent. Maybe maintaining high yields with the new varieties. The mention of traditional varieties, though, suggests there's a dual approach. So preserving traditional knowledge alongside modern practices. Therefore, a task could be integrating traditional methods with new techniques. Another thing, since there's a gene bank, doing breeding work. breeding with traditional and new varieties to improve rice. But as a farmer, maybe that's not directly a task, unless they are involved in the breeding program. However, the farmers are benefiting from the varieties released, so they might not be doing the breeding themselves. Maybe they are planting the bred varieties. So the breeding would be a separate task, maybe at the research center. So overall, the main tasks could revolve around planting and managing rice fields, preserving traditional seeds, training on new methods, and adapting to mountainous terrain. Some of these are the core agricultural tasks.",
