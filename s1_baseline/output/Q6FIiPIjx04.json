                "MAINTASKs are the major tasks, such as comparing plowing methods or explaining no-till farming. Each MAINTASK is broken down into SUBTASKs, which are the specific actions or aspects within that main task. For example, MAINTASK \"Compare traditional plowing methods with conservation techniques\" includes SUBTASKs like explaining the environmental impacts of traditional plowing and the purpose of conservation plowing.",
                "The transcript is relevant to agricultural tasks as it discusses various plowing techniques and their implementation, which are practical aspects of farming. Each MAINTASK and SUBTASK relates directly to physical farm work and agricultural practices, fulfilling the requirement."
