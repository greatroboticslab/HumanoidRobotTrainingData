            "task": "Implement soil conservation techniques such as contour farming, strip cropping, and terrace construction to prevent water erosion and maintain soil health.",
            "subtasks": [
                "Tend fields by alternating rows perpendicular to slopes for even water absorption.",
                "Utilize equipment to till and plant across slopes, creating soil bunds to retain water.",
                "Alternate fields with strips of small grains, row crops, and grass legume hay to break up runoff paths.",
                "Survey and stake terrace lines to create channels that capture runoff and prevent erosion.",
                "Use disc tillers or plows to build ridges and channels on steep slopes, ensuring proper gradient for water flow.",
                "Maintain terraces annually through processes like filling gullies and repairing minor breaks.",
                "Operate tillers to fill gullies by discing soil towards the edges until the ditch is leveled.",
                "Adapt tractor operations for contour cultivation, using methods like sweeping soil up and down slopes to create ridges.",
                "Implement safety measures when working near slopes and gullies, such as avoiding close proximity to dangerous areas.",
                "Establish vegetated outlets in drainage areas to dissipate runoff and prevent gully formation.",
                "Protect water channels from damage by adjusting equipment settings (e.g., using power lifts for row crop cultivators).",
                "Apply manure, limestone, or soil amendments as necessary to maintain soil fertility.",
                "Integrate leguminous vegetation for nitrogen fixation and overall soil health improvement."
