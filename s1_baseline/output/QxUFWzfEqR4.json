The chain saw tasks are all about felling the tree, so from approach to falls, right. Then moving on to the trailer, they need to position it, load the tree, secure it. Then after that, driving. If they needed to unload, perhaps, but not stated. Confirm, the transcript says \"Drive the trailer to the designated storage area.\" So they don't mention unloading. That's correct.",
