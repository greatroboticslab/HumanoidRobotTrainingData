Then a separate MAINTASK: Applying pesticides with subtasks on restricted use handling and label adherence. Also, a MAINTASK: Understanding pesticide safety, but perhaps that's more about the cognitive aspects. Wait, but the question is asking for tasks based on the transcript regarding physical farming. So mixing and loading would be physical, applying also is physical, understanding is more mental. But the task of understanding might involve checking resources and perhaps recording notes mentally or on paper. But the question's criteria are \"a series of tasks based on the transcript that a person would have to perform\" and \"a for each sub-tasks\". So tasks related to the transcript's content. So perhaps the understanding aspect is part of the main task of mixing and loading, as in knowing to check the label before applying.",
