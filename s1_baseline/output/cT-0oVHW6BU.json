                "Press the new gear onto the shaft with the new roll pin. But in his case, he needed a special tool to press in the new roll pin, but since he couldn't get the gear on, maybe needed a press to drive the new gear onto the shaft properly? That's unclear. Alternatively, if he had to use a hammer and punch to drive the roll pin into place, that could be part of the subtask. Otherwise, the inability to get the gear on suggests he may have needed to push or hammer it on, but without proper tools. However, it's also possible that the size and tightness required a press. Since he calls the process a nightmare, it likely involved significant manual labor and potential risk of damaging the gear or drill."
