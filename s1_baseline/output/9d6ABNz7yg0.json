            "task": "The transcript involves discussing agricultural topics, such as farm sizes, crop types (e.g., canola), weather's effect on yields, and regional comparisons (e.g., Saskatchewan vs. North Dakota). While not focusing on specific physical farming tasks, it touches on aspects that relate to the broader agricultural context and operations. Given this, MAINTASKs 1 and 2 capture the essence of the conversation, and a final note explains the relevance. Therefore, the transcript is relevant despite not containing detailed task-oriented content, as the dialogue is centered around agricultural themes.",
