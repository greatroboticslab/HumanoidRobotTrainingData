If we are to follow the instructions and generate a series of tasks based on the transcript, each MAINTASK accompanied by its subtasks. So for the farmer's problems, the tasks related to physical farming are the ones about crop assessment, family feeding concerns, etc. For the displacement, it's about people moving to find work. For the aid project, the World Food Programme implementing the tomatoes project. But the instruction says physical tasks by the person (the user's task), so maybe the aid project is not included. So contain the tasks to farmer-related physical tasks and the broader affect, but since the question is about generating a series of tasks related to farming, the main tasks should center around farming challenges and their immediate solutions.
