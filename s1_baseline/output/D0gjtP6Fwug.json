But perhaps it's just her way of saying she's reversing the grain chute, but I would need more context. Without more details, but given the time constraints here, perhaps the key tasks would be starting the combine, adjusting settings, operating the combine, and moving the grain to the truck. But that's four main tasks. Let me check my initial idea.
