So I think that's a separate main task.",

The viewer could then expand by following the second set of tasks for a larger installation. So, I think the appropriate tasks are the first set. Therefore, I will finalize the answer with those four main tasks under the MAINTASK \"Train plants to climb a wall using command hooks.\" If a user wants to replicate what's shown in the video, they need to perform these steps. However, if they want to build a more extensive green wall, they can refer to the second MAINTASK.",
