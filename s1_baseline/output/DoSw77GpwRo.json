So the video is relevant to farming, specifically goat ranching. Hence, the MAINTASK should cover the overall activities, with subtasks broken down into the physical actions performed. The transcript is not irreverent, as it provides clear examples of tasks involved in goat ranching. So I think these tasks should hold up. The reason for accepting it is that it's about physical tasks related to performing farming activities, specifically goat ranching.",
