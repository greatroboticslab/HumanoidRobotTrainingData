This involves recognizing what plants are growing (SUBTASK: Inspect soil for plants, SUBTASK: Recognize different plant species) and determining their edibility (SUBTASK: Differentiate edible from non-edible). However, the speaker's viewpoint implies needing to challenge the conventional definition of weeds, so there's a mental adjustment required (SUBTASK: Adjust perception of plants as potential feed). Once identified, the next step is to communicate this availability to the livestock (SUBTASK: Communicate feed availability), but perhaps that's more for training the livestock or herd to use that feed.",

This entails observing livestock behavior (SUBTASK: Monitor livestock eating habits, SUBTASK: Observe which plants they consume), and adjusting grazing patterns to direct their consumption towards these previously neglected plants (SUBTASK: Adjust grazing patterns). At the same time, they need to ensure that livestock don't consume harmful plants (SUBTASK: Remove or prevent harmful plants).",

                "Test plant safety with livestock. But the transcript doesn't mention this. Therefore, I think \"Communicate feed availability\" could be considered more about ensuring the livestock know that these plants are edible, but given the context that it's all food and the farmer doesn't see weeds, perhaps that's implied. Alternatively, some livestock might avoid novel plants, so the farmer might need to introduce them, which aligns with monitoring and adjusting grazing."
