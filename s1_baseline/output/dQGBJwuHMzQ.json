But here it's just a sound. But maybe in some herding contexts, \"Hiirk!\" is used as a call to gather animals or something. However, given the lack of context and the instruction being very short (just one word), the most straightforward interpretation is that the task is to produce that sound. Therefore, MAINTASK would be \"Hiirk! exclamation call\", with the subtask being to exclaim it. Since there might not be more to it, I think that should suffice.",
