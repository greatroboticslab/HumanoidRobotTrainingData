The task of operating the machinery is not included as the narrator is a tourist observing, not performing the tasks. The initial task of differentiating barley from wheat is derived from the explicit recognition in the transcript. The tour of the machinery is a significant part of the video, hence separate MAINTASK. Challenges with filming are also a notable part (though secondary) of the content.",
