That makes sense. Let me confirm. Yeah, this is directly related to agricultural practices, especially for maintaining gardens, which is a common task in farming. So the final answer should present these three main subtasks under the main task of installing the drip irrigation system. The transcript is relevant as it provides steps for setting up an irrigation system, which is a physical task. So I'll add a summary note at the end to confirm that.",
