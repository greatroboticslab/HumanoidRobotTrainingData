They also say peppers like high organic matter soil, so maybe ensuring the soil is good. Planting after the last frost; that's a key timing thing. They mention that peppers can tolerate cooler weather but do well when it's really warm. So, maybe watering regularly once they start growing? And if they're in a hoop house or greenhouse, protecting them. But since they can grow in coolish weather, maybe not all that necessary?",

Then, the next part is storing peppers. They talk about freezing peppers for winter use. So MAINTASK: Prepare freezer storage for peppers. There are different types\u2014hot and sweet. So, separate them. For hot peppers, just freeze them in bags. For sweet peppers, chop them up, use ice cube trays with water, then freeze and transfer to bags. So the subtasks here are identifying types, preparing different methods for each, and then storing.",
