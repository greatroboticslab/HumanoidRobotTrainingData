The transcript starts by mentioning the principles of weed control. So, the first subtask could be: SUBTASK: Explain prevention as the first principle of weed control. The second principle is eradication, so that's another subtask: SUBTASK: Describe the second principle of weed control as eradiation. Then, the difference between control and management methods. Probably: SUBTASK: Differentiate between control and management methods of weed control. Then, the transcript introduces mechanical methods as the physical methods. The main idea here is that these methods have been used since man started growing crops."
