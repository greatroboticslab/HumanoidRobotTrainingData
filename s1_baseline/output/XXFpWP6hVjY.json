Breaking it down, the person has to get into the field, identify where the weeds are, then physically remove them. The subtasks would involve approaching the field, getting down to weed level (like crouching), using hands to grip around plants (but gently so as not to damage the corn), pulling them up by the roots, lifting them out, and then disposing of them. And maybe repeating that in different areas. That makes sense. So MAINTASK would be Grappling with weeds in the cornfield, then Subtasks for each step.",
