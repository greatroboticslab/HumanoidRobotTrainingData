            "task": "All right, so let's get into this. A little bit about my background. I am a biologist by trade, nothing to do with plants. I worked at the DNA level at Indiana University. I recently retired last year. But everything I've learned in terms of fruit growing and stuff has been in the last eight years, typically through people who are doing the growing themselves. So why fix? This is not something that is common here in the Midwest. However, there is a demand for fresh jigs in the Midwest, especially down where I'm from. I lived in Bloomington, Indiana, Indiana University, and I was also a student at Purdue. A wide diversity of folks in those areas, many of them coming from California or warmer regions or countries where figs are common, and people eat them every day. If you want to get a fresh fig here in the Midwest, kind of good luck, right? Not easy. Not easy. And if you do get them here, they've been shipped from California or someplace else. And by the time they get here, they've been on a truck for months or weeks or whatever. They're not going to be as great. So we know that there's a demand for fresh figs. If you can get them to grow, you could probably command a very good amount of money for what you grow. So it is a niche market. And so our goal in this project is to work out the conditions where more farmers can start growing fresh figs on a small scale or bigger scale and provide them to local markets if there will be an interest. Okay. So the beauty of figs, unlike other fruits, and I'm not going to get into the growth of a fig and whether or not it's really a fruit or not. But if you're growing apple, pear, peach, persimmon, pawpaw, whether it's native or non-native, you're going to take years before that tree can give you fruit. All right. So the beauty of figs is you can actually start to get figs on one-year-old trees. And if the stars align and the climate is great and everything is perfect, you can actually get a second crop, which is called a Breva. The main crop is in the summer, fall, mostly towards fall, but the secondary crop can be in the spring. The main crop grows on new growth from the season. The secondary Breva crop grows on last year's growth. And I don't talk about the Breva crop very much, but I can direct you to some reading if you're interested in that.",
