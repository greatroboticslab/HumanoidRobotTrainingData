They mention it's 24,000 square kilometers, maybe the size of Belgium, though the speaker hasn't been there. So if we focus on Randall managing the station, which is a cattle property, the main tasks would relate to cattle farming and ranching. So the MAINTASK here is probably \"Cattle Ranching and Cattle Management\" at Anna Krieg Station.",
