Key subtasks include collecting traditional knowledge, engaging communities in research, conservation, revitalizing traditional practices, and sharing findings. This approach ensures that food systems remain resilient and culturally relevant in the face of change. TASKS: Conduct ethnobotanical surveys, engage communities in participatory research, conserve endangered crops, revitalize traditional recipes, apply interdisciplinary methods, and acknowledge Indigenous knowledge contributors. These tasks collectively support the preservation and promotion of Indigenous Food Systems. Physical tasks involve data collection, community engagement, knowledge transfer, and policy advocacy. By integrating traditional and modern methodologies, these research efforts aim to reinforce cultural practices and ecological sustainability.",
