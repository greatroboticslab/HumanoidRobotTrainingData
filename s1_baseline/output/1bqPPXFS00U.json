Testing the provided *compost* (MAINTASK: Testing compost nutrient content) involves similar steps, comparing results to garden soil. Finally, **testing the raised bed garden's soil (MAINTASK: Testing raised bed garden soil)** reveals deficiencies requiring adjustments. Each task contributes to creating a fertile planting environment."
