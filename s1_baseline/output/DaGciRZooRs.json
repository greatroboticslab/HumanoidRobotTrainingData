I think not, as they are just for promotion and not physical actions. The tasks should be related to the farming process. So the MAINTASK is rice transplanting with the subtasks listed. Once the video is analyzed, and seeing that the transcript is all about proper rice transplanting procedures, which are physical tasks related to farming, there should be no issue. So I think the breakdown above is correct. Let me check for anything else. They mention organic manure. Adding manure would be part of preparing the field. They also talk about issues like pests and weeds, so controlling them is a task. Timing the transplant is crucial. Alright, seems comprehensive.",
