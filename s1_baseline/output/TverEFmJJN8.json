Breaking it down further, when they are growing the seeds indoors, they need a temperature around 75-80\u00b0F for optimal germination. So perhaps \"Sealing and maintaining indoor seed trays\" at a certain temperature. But maybe that's too specific. Alternatively, the main task could be \"Gardening: Starting Seeds Indoors\" which subtasks would include setting up seed trays, watering, providing warmth if needed. Then once they're transplanted, that's another task. So maybe MAINTASK: Transplanting seedlings outside. Subtasks: Planting seedlings at 18-24 inches apart, ensuring temperatures are above 60\u00b0F, providing they need six hours of sunlight.",
