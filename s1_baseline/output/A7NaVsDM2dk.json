But the transcript says \"draws the diagrams of agricultural tools,\" so even if it's not explicitly shown, the task exists. The key is to look at the content that a person would have to perform; since the transcript includes tool use and actual physical processes (like plowing, seed selection), these are activities that require physical labor.",
