            "task": "The transcript is simply \"No Thank you\" and \"Thank you\", which are social interactions and not related to physical agricultural work. Therefore, the answer should be \\*\\*\\*TRANSCRIPT\\_IRRELEVANT: due to lack of relevant content. However, according to instructions, need to write the final answer starting with MAINTASK: and then include each subtask (if any). But since there are none, justomenclature get started, first, in this case, MAINTASK: and the reason. Since it's the first MAINTASK and only task here. However, the initial examples provided in the user instruction had MAINTASK and then subtasks. But since our final answer is \\*\\*\\*TRANSCRIPT\\_IRRELEVANT, which itself is not a task, but a classification of the transcript. Therefore, perhaps no MAINTASK is needed, just that \\*\\*\\*TRANSCRIPT\\_IRRELEVANT: is the answer. Yet original instruction says when irrelevant, start with three exclamation points. So that's the rule, according to the user guide.",

            "task": "Another perspective: The user instruction says \"when you are finished with the subtasks for a task, you can start a new task by writing MAINTASK: and then the new general task.\" But in this case, the proper action is \\*\\*\\*TRANSCRIPT\\_IRRELEVANT:. Since it's impossible to generate tasks, even if we tried to subtask it, the conclusion remains the same. Thus, this is the correct final answer. However, 'subtask' in this case would just be the three exclamation points. But since this is the top-level classification, there's no depth here. Ok, the user instruction says \"If you feel that the transcript has nothing to do with the tasks of performing physical farming, agriculture, or operating farming equiptment, then simply say !!!TRANSCRIPT\\_IRRELEVANT: all caps, with 3 exclamation points at the beginning, followed by the reason for the video being irrelevant.\" So that is the proper guidance. Therefore, the answer is exactly as through above, with that note.",

        {
            "task": "Revisiting the original transcript again, \"No, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\" states the case. No, they didn't thank you for a task; that puts a slight nuance but the three exclamation points still require the main point. And given that the subtask would need to outline some kind of task, but in this case, perhaps the main task would be, \"derive physical tasks from the transcript,\" and the subtasks would detail those steps. However, given that there are none, the MAINTASK is \"explain why transcript is irrelevant\" or sometimes the most basic answer is made under 'main task' as \\*\\*\\*TRANSCRIPT\\_IRRELEVANT: with subtask being the reasoning. But despite the instructions to use one task per line with subtasks, given the irrelevance here, the most straightforward maitask would be to state the transcript is irrelevant and no further subtasks are needed. Hence, in such cases, the standard is to omit the subtasks and just include the MAINTASK.",

            "task": "\" and then list of possible subtasks, but since all suggested answers end up being \\*\\*\\*TRANSCRIPT\\_IRRELEVANT:  with no mention of agricultural tasks, each kickoff remains the same. Conclusively, despite the words used, the fact that the conversation isn't about farming and doesn't mention any tasks proves that the transcript is entirely irrelevant.",
