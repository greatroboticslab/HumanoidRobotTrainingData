                "The original question instructed to generate tasks based on the video transcript related to physical farming activities. The transcript describes tasks involving a tractor and a plough, so the breakdown focuses on attaching and detaching the plough, operating the tractor for soil preparation, monitoring progress, and storing the equipment afterward. Each main task (MAINTASK) represents a major step in the process, with subtasks (SUBTASK) detailing the individual actions required for each main step. For example, \"Attach a hitch to a plough\" has subtasks like approaching the plough, locating the hitch mechanism, aligning it, and securing it. The tasks are ordered logically, from preparing the equipment to finishing the job and securing the tools, ensuring a complete workflow relevant to agricultural operations. This answer structure aligns with the instruction to make tasks general and break them down into sub-tasks, providing a clear sequence of physical actions a person would perform in this farming scenario. The response is concise and directly addresses the prompt's requirements."
