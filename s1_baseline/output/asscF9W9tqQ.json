Then \"Planting maize\" as a MAINTASK with subtasks on clearing land (both manual and herbicide options), correct planting spacing, seed rate calculation, and calibrating planters. \"Applying fertilizers\" is another MAINTASK, broken down into timing (10 days after sowing for DAP, then CAN 55 days later) and types (DAP 18-46, NPK 23-23). \"Controlling pests\" would be a MAINTASK, focusing on fall armyworm and the application of Marlon or Escort. Finally, \"Managing weeds\" as a MAINTASK with options for manual versus chemical weed control, including zero-tillage.",
