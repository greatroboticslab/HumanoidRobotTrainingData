            "task": "Install the solar-powered lighting system. That would have subtasks like connecting the solar panel to the battery using the crocodile clips. Then attaching the bulbs to the battery. Positioning the solar panel on the roof. Testing the system by turning lights on and off. Also, since the video shows explaining how it works, maybe there's a task about educating users, like demonstrating how the panel charges the battery and how the lights work. So those would be two separate tasks: the installation (with subtasks), and then an education/assurance task. Does that sound right? The main tasks should be \"install system\" and \"educate users\"? But the installation already includes testing. Hmm. Maybe combine it. But the user feedback part is important. Maybe split into: 1. Install the solar-powered lighting system (connect panel, attach bulbs, position on roof, test). 2. Ensure user satisfaction and explain system operation. Then yes. So two main tasks. The install task would have the specific steps as subtasks. For the first task: MAINTASK: Install solar-powered lighting system. Subtasks: connect solar panel to battery, attach bulbs, position solar panel on roof, test lighting system. The second task: MAINTASK: Educate users on system operation and satisfaction. Subtasks could include explaining how the solar panel charges the battery, demonstrating the lights brightening, and confirming users are happy (though the second task might cover some of that within itself). Hmm. Alternatively, the second task could be \"Test system and confirm user satisfaction\", but they mention explaining how it works, so perhaps separate into two tasks. But let's think, the user talking in the transcript seems to go through each step, first the connection, then attachment, then positioning, then testing. Then after testing, they talk about how easy it is and user satisfaction. So maybe splitting into two main tasks: one for setup/installation and one for user interaction. So it's two MAINTASKs: \"Install solar lighting system\" and thereafter \"Obtain user feedback on installation\". Alternatively, maybe \"Testing and user education\". But anyway, the video title mentions \"System\" so maybe the focus is more on system setup. Then the second part is assurance post-installation. But since the transcript is detailed about the system, just maybe one MAINTASK and the rest are sub tasks with a bit of education at the end. But that maybe becomes separate. Let me read the transcript again. The main content is about the person explaining the setup and showing someone how it works, then asking if they can work it, and then confirming user satisfaction. So they are walking through the entire process from initial connection to testing and then final satisfaction. So maybe I can just have two subtasks under \"Install system\": the connecting and positioning, then another subtask for testing, and perhaps a subtask for ensuring user satisfaction. But the transcript isn't too long. Alternatively, since the transcript begins with the installation process, which is the main task, and the solar system's connection is a specific and detailed process, separate from user education. So maybe the \"educate users\" aspect was an afterthought. But given that the user is explaining the system's operation, maybe it's part of the install task. Alternatively, start the MAINTASK with installation and explain that it also includes user education. Then having the user satisfaction as a subtask. I need to decide. Since the transcript is about someone going through the steps of setting up this system and then confirming it works, maybe the main task can be \"Set up solar-powered lighting system\" including testing and user interaction. But considering that the user interaction is minimal in the transcript, just the end part where they ask if people would welcome the light. Alternatively, if the main task is about the physical setup, then maybe there's a separate task for explaining the system. But the transcript is mostly about the physical steps, with some explanation. Let me check again: the beginning is about connecting the solar panel to the battery, attaching the clips, testing the lights, saying it's easy. Then they move to the roof, attaching it there. Then testing again. Then at the end, they confirm that people are happy. So possibly, the main task is about \"Install and test solar-powered lighting system\", and perhaps a follow-up task about ensuring user satisfaction. However, the user satisfaction part might be considered part of the testing phase. Alternatively, since the transcript ends with user satisfaction, maybe that is a separate task, but in the video transcript, that's at the end. If we need to structure two main tasks, given the content, one is setup/installation, the other is confirming satisfaction. But given the content is about the entire process from start to finish, it's more of a cohesive task. Alternatively, considering it's a powerpoint presentation or demonstration, it's one comprehensive task. But given the user is listing the steps, maybe someone would need to perform these steps physically. But perhaps some of the steps of the system are automated or not physical. Wait, no, the entire system: connecting wires (physical), placing the solar panel (physical), turning on lights (physical), testing (physical), confirming that it's working. So to what extent are these tasks? Are connecting wires considered a task? Or is that a subtask under \"Install system\"? Probably. Similarly, placing the solar panel is a physical task, so that's a subtask. Similarly, turning on the lights is a physical step. So perhaps the key task is \"Install solar-powered lighting system\" with the following subtasks:",
