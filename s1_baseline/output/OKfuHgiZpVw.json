The farms use some kind of rotation to bring the harvesters around. They have to position the crops away from the turning points where the machine would hit them. Also, the gear shift and the toggle power latch. Some people might want to add an off-switch, so that's another thing. Redstone frequency setup as a precaution. Then the chute and chest for output. So for the MAINTASK of constructing the farm, I need to list all these subtasks.",

We have harvesters connected to a Gantry Carriage which goes along our Gantry Shaft.\" Then he goes into the mechanism. So the machine operates by the Gantry Carriage moving back and forth on the Shaft, powered by a rotation that's toggled via redstone signals when the carriage reaches the ends. The operation explanation is quite detailed. So that would be a separate MAINTASK.",

But the transcript does spend a significant portion of the video explaining how it works, so perhaps separating it as two distinct tasks would be better. The viewer is both building the machine and learning how it operates, so the subtasks would need to cover both aspects.",
