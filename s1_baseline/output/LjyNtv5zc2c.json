Maybe some parts of the transcript were unclear or overlapped, but the key is to identify the broad actions and break them down into manageable subtasks. Once identified, the MAINTASKs (major tasks) with their SUBTASKs form the complete list. This approach ensures coverage of the transcript's relevant content."
