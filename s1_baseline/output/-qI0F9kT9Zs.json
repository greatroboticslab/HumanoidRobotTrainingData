Also including moving on to container gardening\u2014so small terracotta pots for herbs (portable, snip while cooking), then vertical gardening with rain gutters (showing how to repurpose them for growing seasonally, like radishes and beans). Then the vertical totes for carrots (show, mention blue color). The melon trellis (DIY system, how it supports plants, allows space efficiency). In the front yard, mention using containers on the porch (herbs, peppers) and a plum tree. The community garden plot: talk about the challenges of growing organically in a plot, methods like using protective covers (tutu tool), growing garlic, cucumbers, tomatoes.",
