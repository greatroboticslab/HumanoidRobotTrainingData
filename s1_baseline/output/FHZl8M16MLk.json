The MAINTASK is broad enough to cover the main educational points, and the subtasks provide structure for understanding each aspect. The inclusion of specific animals (ferrets, mice, chickens) relates to agricultural practices, albeit in a specialized context (laboratory and research settings). This maintains a connection to farming/agriculture through the use of animals, even if the tasks are primarily informational.",
