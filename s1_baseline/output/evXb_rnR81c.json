So I need to make sure each main action is generalized as a MAINTASK followed by more specific SUBTASKs. I think that's the format.",

However, since the transcript shows dialogue with someone explaining the entire process from start to finish, all the tasks are interconnected. The user is described as right in the middle of doing various things. However, the transcript mentions several different steps, but they are part of the overall process of using winter rye as a cover crop. Thus it's one main task split into several subtasks. Hence why I grouped everything under a single MAINTASK and then multiple SUBTASKs."
