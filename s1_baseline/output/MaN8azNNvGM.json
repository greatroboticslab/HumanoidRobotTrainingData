Specific subtasks are included to demonstrate the range of activities involved, and the roles are assigned for clarity. The structure follows the initial MAINTASK with its subtasks, then breaks down into preparatory (MAINTASK) and post-harvest tasks (MAINTASK) as well. The DRAMATIS PERSONAE section provides character roles, which may be helpful for understanding the division of labor. The answer is concise yet comprehensive, capturing the key aspects of the described combine harvester's operation.",
