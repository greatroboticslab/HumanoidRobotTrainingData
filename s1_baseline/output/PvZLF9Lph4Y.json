However, maintaining and operating such systems on a farm would require physical labor and adherence to multiple smaller tasks, hence this composite task. The sub-tasks relate to the process involved in running such a system, considered a farming operation involving technology. Therefore, despite the initial concern about getting into project leaps, the main task is positioned as \"Farming Operations and Equipment Management\" (as per the earlier task). However, if the focus is strictly agricultural tasks without considering the technological elements, then the process steps might not apply. With that caveat, I proceed.",
