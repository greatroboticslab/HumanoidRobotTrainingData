The rest of the transcript seems to talk about benefits and wrapping up, which would be two more maintasks. But the rest of the transcript is marked as an ending. Thus, even though the transcript finishes with additional text, I should only include the sections related to the physical tasks. Considering that the main tasks in the first part of the transcript, like moving hogs into the new grazing plot with all the steps, setting up the water and shelter, expressing thanks, all thing relevant. Each of these are main tasks with their respective subtasks. If the intention of the user is to generate tasks based on the given transcript\u72ec\u5bb6\u4ee3\u7406, then based on this, responding MAINTASKs for moving hogs, discussing rotational grazing benefits, expressing gratitude, and final conclusion. Since the rest is unrelated, I need to consider stopping when the main tasks are completed. It's possible that the last few lines of the transcript are part of the conclusion (e.g., \"Rel at Edited Explained...\" might be a clumsy attempt at saying \"Rel at the end\" or \"Peace at the end,\" but doesn't make sense in context, possibly some mistake in speech-to-text. But regardless, because the provided transcript ends with it, and in the absence of a clear end, it's safest to stop including text after a certain point.",
