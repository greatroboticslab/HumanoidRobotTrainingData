First, since they're comparing it to how wild animals do it, one thing is to observe how those animals move. So, the first subtask is to observe patterns of wild herbivores\u2014I changed it to \"gravitational\" roots and green grass growing\u2014never ending? Hmm, maybe that was a typo. Anyway, but the main point is the patterns of the wildlife. So, maybe noting how often they move, how much land they cover, that sort of thing. So, calculating the duration they stay in one area would be useful, like 40-50 days.",
