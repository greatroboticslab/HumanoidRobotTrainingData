 How are guys doing up there? I mean, Jason, for example, has a little farming operation. You know, he has one field at 1,600 acres. They don't make many corners. Wow. Canola is still really big, that kind of thing. It depends on where you're at. They got a little dry at the end, and it really affected the canola crop. But at the same time, if you go to Tisdale, Canada, it reminded me a lot of Oaks, North Dakota. Really? You know, a lot of still square. It's funny, in Saskatchewan, they still talk about miles, and they still talk about acres. Shhh, don't tell anybody. They do? Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. And they still got to, you know, follow the street signs and all that kind of thing. But, you know, everything's laid out very similar to North Dakota. They don't do as much tiling as they do around here. They haven't got that far yet. And, you know, very little row crop. There's a few areas of soybeans. It's just, you know, just that much farther north. And it gets a little colder there. Yeah.
