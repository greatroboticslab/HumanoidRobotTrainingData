 G'day there. Managing weeds is unfortunately a part of land ownership. Many weeds are highly invasive and can quickly overtake land. They can have a devastating impact on agriculture and ecosystems and can also cause severe illness in both people and animals. So, for better or worse, you have an obligation to control them under the Biosecurity Act 2015. The good news is that weeds can be controlled and there are resources available to guide your weed management. Here are a few quick tips. Have practices in place to prevent weeds from entering your property. These include having a holding paddock or yard area dedicated to receiving new livestock so that weed seeds can be eliminated from animals, having a dedicated, well-equipped area for washing down and cleaning vehicles and farm machinery, and knowing where your fodder is coming from and ensuring that it's weed-free. Simple measures can all help stop weed spread. It's important to control weeds before they seed or spread, after rain and during spring are key times for weed control. It's useful to get out and have a walk around your place regularly to look for any incursions, particularly around watercourses and boundaries. Also, check out any feed distribution areas or locations where new stock have been. If you notice any new or suspect species, check the Department of Primary Industries Weedwise app for tips on identification and management, or contact your local authority. These are usually your local council. Identifying what weeds you have in the paddock is key to an effective control program. Some control techniques are not appropriate for all weed species, so you need to know what you're starting with and have a plan. Again, check out the NSW DPI website or contact your local authority for control advice. Until next time, cheers.
