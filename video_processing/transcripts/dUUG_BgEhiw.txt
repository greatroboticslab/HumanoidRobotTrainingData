Science & Technology
 I want to do it how the wildlife did it, where they rotated constantly every day. How the buffalo did it, how the antelope and deer did it. Before fences stopped them from rotating, they were never in the same thousand acres for, you know, 40, 50 days. It just never happened. I want to create deep, thick roots and deep soil. And by doing that, the only way you can do that is rotate livestock. And keep a living root and green grass growing as long as possible.
