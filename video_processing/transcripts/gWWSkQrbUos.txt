 Straw input is a useful practice that can improve soil fertility and crop yields while simultaneously helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, if not done properly, it can lead to excessive emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4, and N2O. A recent study has shown that the optimal combination of straw input and management practices can help to reduce these emissions while still providing benefits to farmers. This includes low straw input rates, straw mulching, application of straw with a high C-slash-N ratio, long-term straw input, and no tillage combined with straw input. These measures have been found to be effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions without sacrificing crop yield or soil quality.
