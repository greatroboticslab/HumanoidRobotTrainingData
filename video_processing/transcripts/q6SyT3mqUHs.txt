 Hey what's going on this is Nate with Tiny Hilltop. We got hit pretty hard with some snow and a lot of the things I want to get going on I've kind of had to put on hold. Luckily it's warmed up today we're in the upper 50s low 60s a lot of Sun so the snow is melting pretty quickly. Today I'm right outside my house I'm under one of my black walnuts and I'm going to build some cold frames underneath it. First thing I need to do is move a little snow then I'm gonna let the ground dry a little and build those cold frames. ooo. oooo. haha. o I have done a lot of weird things in my life, but I think that's the first time I have shoveled earth just to shovel it. I've created trails a few times, but I think that's my first earth shoveling. But I'm going to let the sun kind of get out of that spot for the rest of the day and get at it in the morning. It's the next morning. The spot's really cleaned out really well. It's melted. There's no snow left in this little area. So I'm going to get the cob on. All right. So I have the boards cut for those. I'm just going to make some rectangles. I think I'm going to go inside and do it. Usually for a level surface, I use my dad's deck, but it's still really covered in snow. So I think I'm just going to take them inside and make sure they're level. I have those bottom ones done. The bottom rectangles. Now I'm just going to build the top ones. I'm going to build the top ones. I'm going to build the top ones. I'm going to build the top ones. I'm going to build the top ones. I'm going to build the top ones. Sometimes I'm growing where there shouldn't be any walnut roots. Also this area gets a lot of southern sun. So I think it's a good spot for me to extend my season both ways. Long term, I want to have about eight to ten of these. And my goal is to have it be sort of like my kitchen garden, my personal kitchen garden. So when I'm cooking or making smoothies, I can just walk out, have a bunch of herbs, and go through, find what I need, and cook with them. What I'm doing for the top frame for the diagonal part, I'm basically just cutting the same parts out I did for the bottom rectangle, but I'm just taking the sideboard and just doing one and splitting it right down the middle. I had the top sections all put together. I'm going to go through with foot sections of pine, 2x2 pine, and secure them to each other. Those are good to go. I need to build the top. I'm going to build the top out of some tough text panels or something similar. But what I'm going to do now, before I do that, is actually fill them with some soil from the pile I have from where they dug my dad's foundation. Just to see how they sit and if I need to put a crossbar or anything before I put a top on if I have to move them around or finagal them in any way. You can really imagine if three steps can work. Not so much before the edge of the plate. There's これを作りました。 You need to do that in your third pieces and in your eighth. And there is some staan床のdieも to wrestle with Otsosok andülpaid where I Ал are two, and someone gets out of the middle. There are two little hills and Raj contain range. There are kind of plenty of jump-and-�동s left竹合 that are just getting on on the middle. Sales demokrat Ham. The first step of the record is shorten it along. It's actually a variety of depth that I can't jump from the top of on the here, of which is BrittanyFS and an 아주 ч. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so I mulched the area and now I'm going to throw together some tops out of some 2x2s and then fasten the plastic Tuftex panel to it. It's not exactly a Tuftex panel, it's a substitute, I don't know what brand it is. I'll track that down and throw it in the description. And there they are. I'm done with them, pretty pleased with how they turned out. I put a little thing so I can open them halfway to working them. I can also open them all the way with the hinges on the back. Probably eventually going to have to get some stronger hinges, just use some ones that are laying around. But I'm going to see how they hold up. If they rip out, I'll get some new ones, no big deal. Thanks for hanging out, I appreciate it. Take it easy, I'll catch you later.まぁ before I leave, see it on screen now. It's been kind of modularity crystal, it's quite great. There we go! Do another action today. Are you dinosaurs dead?
