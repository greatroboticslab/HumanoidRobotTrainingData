 I don't think a lot of people think about managing pasture, that you can make a lot of money off just managing your grass. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to fire up a tractor. I probably didn't fire up a tractor to do anything with cattle for 10 months last year. There's lots of ways, you know, that you can manage your cattle and not have to put grain into them. I don't give my cows grain at all. They get grass and then they graze corn stalks. And, you know, and there's a lot of economical ways to make the grass even more profitable with the cows you select for, you know.
