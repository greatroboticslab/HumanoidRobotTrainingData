from the business side of peak farming of course i understand uh that peak farming for many is a passion is an interest uh there is a probably an enthusiasm towards it you enjoy doing it but uh again in the in the end what really matters is uh how profitable is your venture how profitable is your business so let me quickly share some tips with you today on how to make more money from the peak farming business uh several farmers are not making profit from peak farming i could prove that to you because uh from my own experience moving around i can tell you already that several farmers are not really making it in peak family and that's not because peak family is not profitable it's really profitable but because of certain mistakes and that's one of the reasons why this channel exists to share with you lots of great content to educate you to enlighten you on certain things you need to work on to ensure you get your farm much more profitable all right so uh let me let me talk to you about certain things uh from a business point on uh peak farming and how you can enhance your business how you can make more money from peak family all right uh now there's one thing that uh we all need to understand in in business generally business is about buying and selling of products and buying and selling of certain items in this case selling peaks so depending on whatever model you are doing one thing that makes you to be in business is that you have uh a product the peaks and you are selling them to a customer to your final consumer or whatever you have there so now you have products that you want to sell out if you are able to sell at the right price to the right customers then you are in business and if you can continue that for a while because the peak farming business is not just for a day or for just one set you're not just doing this for maybe you just buy 10 peaks and you sell them and that's all obviously you are continuing a process uh you can be in people for 10 years for 20 years so obviously you need to have a continuous uh sales of your product and that brings me to the very first key the very first tip for you to make more money in peak farming and that's number one have a very good reputation have a very good reputation you see it's an emotional business you know business is generally emotional and i believe you have probably heard this saying that people don't buy product people buy state so uh so someone will decide to buy from you because they like you because they trust you because they believe in you and they will not buy for the same thing the same price from someone else so people buy states and if you understand this uh logic this psychology to business then you understand that you want to ensure that your customers have the right uh interest as the as the right relationship with you so you want to build great relationship with your customers you want to ensure that you are very honest you are very credible you want to ensure your credibility is on the higher side that you have great reputation when it comes to dealing that means number one for instance let's say you are selling um breeders to farmers you want to ensure that you have all the if you say this breed is a tn breed it's a d it's a tn breed if you are calling this breed a duroc it's a duroc you want to have great credibility if you want to say this pig is pregnant then this pig is pregnant you know i heard of someone a farmer that bought uh pigs from another farm and uh he was told that if the pigs were pregnant but on getting to the farm after two months the pigs are not pregnant the pig was not pregnant and in calling that farmer back the farmer is not picking picking up the call do you see exactly that that farmer do you think that farmer is going to get to that farm to get any other thing or he's going to make any referral to that farm no and that's already a very bad thing for his business because nobody if if he knows anybody going to that farm he will caution the person that that guy is not credible so you want to ensure you have the best credibility when it comes to any business and which include the pig farming business anything you are going to if you're going to talk about their medication you are going to ensure you're giving them the proper medication they do warming and everything you're not going to sell pigs that are going to be uh i'm going to call turn to casualty when it gets to the other farm because that will kill your credibility and once your credibility is dead the business is a very small world the business one is a small world everybody in town understands that that person is not credible they don't come to you anymore and if you can't sustain your market if you can't keep selling your product you're not in business so if you won't have the ability to expand when you don't have the right customers coming to buy your product so you want to earn honesty is a very important currency in this business so that's one key that you must have to ensure that you keep making money in peak farming you must be extremely honest great reputation they know this person is like this and they know you you would not lie about what you're doing that's very very important now i talked about the external customer but let me quickly channel this discourse to also the internal customers a lot of people forfeit the interest and the importance of their internal customers i call the internal customers their workers now if you don't have the right credibility the right reputation with your workers you should know you are you are you are a dead meat if i permit me to say that because your internal customers are the ones that sustains your business so if your internal customers feel you are fraudulent you don't pay them they are wages you don't pay them their salaries or you are not faithful or you treat them like like uh like uh they don't exist like they are unimportant then you are writing letter to failing in your business because they are the ones that keep your business going somebody said you don't make it a duty to impress your customer but make it a duty to amaze your customers and i'm talking both your external and your internal customers i for a person now i can tell you one thing that uh permit me to say this and to talk about myself when it comes to reputation it's really there i have people that will vouch for me anyway and it's it's just that way even without me being there a worker will tell you what kind of that that's pressing it's not like that it's a very fruitful person i would not deny my internal workers of their uh right of what they are supposed to get i would actually do much more and go for that to impress them to amaze them to make them worthy to make them interested and that's the reason why you will see how passionately they do the work and they are they are given to do there is a guy that works for me uh he works in certain ways that you will be surprised you will think i pay more than what i pay you know but because of the fact that he understands there's fitfulness in this person i'm not going to you're not going to do a work for me and i'm going to try to swindle you or to scam you no what i i do as much as possible to ensure that you are also making it in life and that's what we must also do if you want to keep making money in peak family ensure both your internal and external customers are doing very well and you have great relationship with them great repetitions with them and that's uh that's uh once you have that believe me the the it's it's uh it's very certain that you can have great profits great money and make good money from your peak family business well that's not all i will also talk about this one is something i've spoken about uh in a while i've been speaking about this and that's getting healthy stocks getting if you want to make money from your peak farm from your peak um business please get ld stock please get ld stock be very careful of not just don't just get stocks from any farm i think i've said that uh very often here make sure the farmers you are getting your stocks from are very credible they have the right reputation themselves so that you can easily trace their genetics if they tell you they are selling to you a large white you know it's a large white you're buying don't buy stocks from just any farm be very careful when you are buying your stock uh ensure they have the right medication being done on the farm ensure they have the right genetics ensure that they've taken their high on injection when they are supposed to have taken it because that was one of my friend um he told me he was telling me recently that he suspected that the reason why uh some pigs he got some while ago while i think all of them died or something was because of probably uh the fact that that those pigs probably did not take their iron injection when you're supposed to there are farmers like that that don't care about many of all these things they don't they don't maintain good uh medication on their farm if you get on peaks from that farm they may be good while you are looking at them right there but once you shift them away from that farm to your own farm then they start having problems so make sure you get the right genetics and you ensure that they have taken all their medications and they are the right breeds you are you intended to buy so number two is for you to make sure you buy ld stocks please if you already want to make money from because this your ap can stay on your farm for at least five years and keeps giving you uh piglet so you want to ensure you are buying the best uh um ensure pigs in the best state so please uh make sure you buy ld stocks number three is take the peak farming business very serious take it incredibly serious many people i i you know i can i cannot tell you what i don't know i can only tell you what i know from my own experience in watching farmers around me i've seen that several people don't take their farming business very serious uh if you ask many farmers to show you their records on your farm many don't even have anything called a farm record if you have a farm if you're in business and you don't have the right record how then do you monitor your profit and sales how then do you uh monitor what's going on how do you monitor the amount of money you are spent so take your farming your business serious the right time to feed them the right medication the right um cleanliness the right management everything you need to know to everything you need to do to ensure the business is is done well it's moving forward please do it take it very serious take it like i see uh your life depends on it because it really does so you want to pay attention to it immensely you want to put in all your all effort to ensure it goes very well don't um be like those who that come in the morning feed the pigs and that's all they go away they don't check on the piece they don't check if they are okay they just go away and uh they don't give them the warmer they don't deworm them they just put them there expecting that somehow somehow the pigs are going to be okay please take your farming or your pig farm very serious pay attention to every detail be extra uh involved in your business and then the last but not the list is for you to invest in knowledge if you really want to get it right in peak farming you want an expert to be around you because anything can happen at any time it's as much as uh you may you may have been doing well for a while you could wake up one day and discover certain things may happen on your farm and that's why you need an expert around to be able to walk you
