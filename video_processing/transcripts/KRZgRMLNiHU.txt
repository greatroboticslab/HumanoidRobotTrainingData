 Life could be changing for the better for the Batwa people, a minority tribe in Uganda that once survived on hunting from the forest they occupied back in time. The people have now embarked on smart agricultural practices to boost their production of food and cash crops. A number of Batwa communities in Rwanda and Kisoro districts are currently benefiting from a soil and water management project that has seen them learn new conservation approaches. The project is implemented by Nature Uganda, a local conservation organization in the country. Part of the approaches is the use of contoured trenches that help in preventing soil erosion since Chegezi is a hilly area. According to Achilles Biaruhanga, the executive director of the nature of the nature of Uganda, with the resettlement of the Batwa, most of them acquired small pieces of land. But due to the poor land practices they were using, they could not get any good yields. This prompted them to consider encroaching on the forest once again for livelihood. Biaruhanga says the strategy is aimed at better farming and will see the Batwa transformed to better living. They served for younger families. It is also trying to Jacne Mark insanlar. Trying to provide assistance in areas where they can use these facilities to get those benefits that they'll receive from the forest. So if, for example, they going there for food, how can we work with them so that we'll manuscript where then they would use fire to harvest the honey but eventually burn the forest. He adds that smart agricultural practices in the Batwa communities have so far proved effective and most people are embracing the approaches for improved production. They have introduced soil and water conservation so that they can protect these small pieces of land where they live. But also we have got some other additions. We are practicing what we call climate smart agriculture where you can produce a lot from a small piece of land. So we have been digging fanyachini, what we call fanyachini, all contour trenches to stop soil erosion. On those trenches we are going to put some plants like animals, like napier grass, so that these plants that we are planting to stabilize the soil can be used now to feed the animals. Some of the beneficiaries say they are optimistic of increased production and therefore their farming practices will be desirable. We appreciate the new approach for farming because prior to this we would plant our crops and they all get swept away by the heavy rains. The system is going to help us get the best from our efforts. We appreciate the efforts to use contour trenches. These people have surely helped us in good resettlement because they have taught us good farming practices and also offered us crops to grow for improved food production. Prior to their resettlement the Batwa lived in huts constructed of leaves and branches moving frequently in search of fresh supplies of food. Since 1992 the Batwa communities have been experiencing a vast transformation as Bwindi impenetratable forests which was their home became a national park and World Heritage Site to protect the 350 endangered mountain gorillas within its boundaries.
