Howto & Style
 All right, it's as simple as that. I read a blog post a little while ago saying that you can keep your chicken's water from freezing by putting a saltwater solution in a 20 ounce bottle. I'll link to the article down below. I don't know if it's going to work, but let's try it today and see what happens. I've been waiting for it to get cold out again. We're 15 degrees today. It's a pretty simple process. It just calls for a quarter of a cup of salt. I'm using rock salt, and it says fill it up the rest of the way with water. I'm just using lukewarm water to help melt the salt. Come on, Pluto. All right, it's as simple as that, I hope. We've been using the saltwater solution for three days now. Today's the coldest morning. It's nine degrees Fahrenheit out. Let's go check and see if the chicken's water froze overnight. Come on, Pluto. Let's go check on the chickens. Come on. Come on, ladies. Some fresh eggs. Noisy rooster. Sounds about right here at Lumna Acres. That guy crows all day, all night long. Sometimes we'll hear him at like two, three in the clock in the morning. No ice buildup there. A little bit here on the sides. You can feel it. I'm going to call that a success. It's not below zero out, but it's nine degrees out, and the water didn't freeze overnight. So I'm happy with that. Ends up freezing when it gets below zero. That's fine. I can deal with that every once in a while. We've had good success so far with this. I hope you do too.
