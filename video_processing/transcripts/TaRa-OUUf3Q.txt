 Hi, I'm threshing wheat and this last couple weeks I've been harvesting and threshing wheat, grinding it into flour and I've finally gotten a system that I think is working pretty efficiently, so I'll share that with you later in the video. But this whole episode is going to be devoted to the wheat harvest which takes up a significant amount of time but it also nets us a large amount of calories and this wheat would have been planted last fall when fossil fuels were widely available and then as fossil fuels crashed through the spring the wheat grew up and just sat there and was not able to be harvested so I had to come and harvest it by hand using very minimal fossil fuels. I did use my truck to move all of the stuff back to my house but it was only a mile so you know we used a minimal amount of gas really to get this job done and now I am in the process of threshing. This is about half of what I harvested so I'm about halfway through the threshing. I'll take you through it as I go but welcome to this week in foodmageddon where we're harvesting wheat. Hi, you usually don't see me here until the end of the video but I thought I'd jump on just in case there's some new viewers to the Foodmageddon series because of this wheat video and I just want to look at the what we're doing. Basically we are simulating the collapse of fossil fuels in the today's food system. So back in January we started weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels as if there was some sort of fossil fuel crisis. Luckily this worked out really well because we were really prepared for COVID hitting and essentially by September we will be completely cut off from the outside world and the only one of the food that we can add to our pantry will be from what we are able to get ourselves with human power around our house. So part of that process is harvesting the wheat from a nearby farm and you may see me talk about how if fossil fuels disappeared this is what we would have to do in actual terms as if it was actually happening because what this series is meant to be is a window into an alternative reality where fossil fuels have collapsed. So I'll make some links here you can go back to the beginning and start watching from the beginning if you're interested we have we we have episodes almost every week telling about how we prepared what we're doing and how we're coping with the loss of fossil fuels in our food system which I think is a really important thing to consider especially with the disruptions and for the food system we've seen since the coronavirus has been has been happening. So yeah have a look back and I hope you'll subscribe and share the this with some friends so thanks for watching. Time to harvest wheat this was planted last fall on my neighbor's property but now you didn't have fossil fuels how would you harvest it and luckily I happen to have the tools to do it so we're going to be harvesting about a tenth of an acre and I'm going to be letting you know exactly how much work it is to harvest a tenth of an acre. A tenth of an acre is about 4,350 square feet and and it should have enough and it should have about 8 bushels worth of wheat which will be 450 pounds of grain. We'll see how it goes. Well I've done half a row out of 6 and I already have a big appreciation for not only the people that could do this well hundreds of years ago but also the modern machines that you know could do this with fossil fuels because it's a lot of work and also a lot of skill so don't take this as a good instruction this is just me practicing and learning how to do it maybe by the by the end of this week I'll have a good good rhythm and pattern down. But my goal basically is to use this scythe to cut and cradle as much wheat as I can and drop it neatly into a pile with all the heads on one side and all the stubby tails on the other. Doesn't always work out. It's quicker I'm finding if I make a foul throw to just come and fix it. And I'm getting a lot of shatter which means a lot of grain is falling out on the ground because the heads are shaking and it's knocking the grain loose. Problem is this grain is too dry. I should have harvested this a week ago. I don't have that background knowledge that someone a hundred years ago would have had to know that I should have done it earlier. I should have harvested this a week ago. I don't have that background knowledge that someone a hundred years ago would have had to know that I should have done it earlier. pretty much cheaper Ahhhhida The it A huh I We'll be right back. PiggyRY coercion nurses team Hus蓮 or Smoked Now believe it or not, doing all this maybe five minutes with the side. That's the easy part. Now I have to bundle them into sheaths. This is dwarf wheat. You can see how short it is. Thanks to Norman Borlaug and the 1960s who developed this dwarf wheat, we can grow a lot more wheat on the head of each stalk than we used to be able to. If this wheat were as tall as old wheat was, then it would lodge. The head would be too heavy for the strand and it would lodge in the ground and become useless. So they shortened the wheat. It was a Japanese dwarf variety. They crossbred it, shortened the wheat and now you can grow tons of wheat on each stalk. However, I can't do what I used to do which was use the stalk itself as a binder for a sheaf of wheat or a clump, a group of wheat that you bind together. You just use the wheat itself to do it. This is too short so I have to use twine which is kind of annoying. But now I have to bind all this together. Now in days long ago when people actually mowed their own wheat like this, this would be the job of two binders for every one mower. Because you can mow twice as fast as you can bind. So usually it would be the husband generally doing the scything. The more evenly you mow this the easier it is for the binders. So you had to be as skillful as possible not to upset the people that had to come after you and clean it all up. And then the wife and older kids helping with the binding and the younger kids, they'd be picking up off the ground these loose heads and stuffing them in a sack. These are gleanings. You may have heard in the Bible or maybe old accounts of agriculture, gleanings in fields. This is what you pick up off the ground that's not attached to the stalk anymore. And biblically you're supposed to leave it for poor people and the birds. I may or may not do that. I may just pick it up myself. So we'll see. We'll maybe get some kids out here soon to help me with this. So after about 8 hours of harvesting total I have all these sheaves of wheat, which are bundles of wheat, piled in my garage. And I have to process them into grain as quickly or process them to get the grain out as quickly as possible. Each one of these heads has grains and chaff in them. And so I have to essentially do that to every single head to get the grain out. And the process to get that grain out is called threshing. And there's many different ways to do it. The traditional way would be to put this all on the ground and beat it with flails or have oxen trod over them until they knock all the heads loose or have kids jump on it or beat it with sticks. There's all kinds of different ways to do it depending on where you are in the world. Another kind of low budget way to do it if you have a small plot of wheat that you want to work is to use just a clean tub. So this is a clean garbage bin. I have never used it for garbage. It's only for food and food related processing. So if I take this sheaf and open it up, and this is why it's important to get all the heads on one side of the sheaf and all the straw on the other side so you don't have to go through later and pick through and make sure that it's aligned. See here I have to turn, grab all these heads and turn them around. So that they're all aligned to one end. This is what really increases the time to process. So it really behooves you to make sure you align all the grain really carefully in the field to save yourself time later. And then really I just take these heads of grain and beat them. Beat them on both sides. And you can see the grain heads are still here but there's no grain left in them. All of the very dry seeds have dropped out. So now that's just straw. Straw is when it doesn't have any seeds in it. Hay is when it does. So now it's straw. This is hay and this is straw technically speaking. So we could do that a lot. But I've built a flailing machine basically that can be run by bicycle. I'm going to use a motor, an electric motor because it's just me. You need two people to operate if you run it with a bicycle. But it's right behind me here so let's have a look at that. So over here I have essentially what amounts to a large octagonal drum. And right now I have it set up. This can close but right now I have stops in here and I'll show you why later. So what you can do is put in your wheat here, close it, latch it, and then ride a bicycle. And it turns a series of flails inside and I'll show you that in a minute. I have it set up right now with this opening so that I can let it run and I will stick the sheaves of wheat in as you'll see. But this is a little bit of a modification to run as a one person operation as opposed to a two person operation. You can run it as a batch meaning you put it in, run it for a set amount of time and then clean it out. I'm going to run it continuously and just keep putting heads in until it's full. So what this is essentially is a central axle with these flails that spin in kind of a worm pattern. So it pushes everything this way and then the seeds and chaff fall down this open slot in the side. So I add things over here and it gets beaten as they move down and then I have to clear out all the straw and the excess chaff. But most of this or almost all the seeds and some of the chaff falls down through this gap. And you're not supposed to run it with it open but we'll do it here just for fun so you can see. Now this gets to be very dusty so I'm going to wear a respirator and I'm going to tie my hair up with a bandana to keep the dust out of my hair. That, here comes the respirator which makes it a little hard to talk plus it will be loud anyway. But essentially what I'm going to do is take from my wheat over here and then as this is spinning put the heads of grain in and those flails will knock the wheat right off of it. Then I can pull the straw out and put it in that waiting wheelbarrow. So here we go. I can stop cooking so we'll like the Smoothie to get rid of it. So now kr Agrла, it's a clue to the brunt that's all right! The Goodwill Okay, so, oh, sorry, got my respirator off. Okay, so now that I've run it, in here we've got a lot of chopped straw. And the stuff on top I can just take out, because all the grain just fall into the bottom. So I can pretty safely just grab this stuff and chuck it out. What's left in here is just grain and chaff. And I'll just sweep all that grain down the little gap there. Get the straw out. There we go, ready for the next batch. And the bucket then is the bucket. Now this is full of chaff and seeds. So I'm going to run it through a sorter. And then we'll do some winnowing. And we'll do some winnowing to get to the grain. And now we have the sorting machine, which is a series of boxes basically, with different sizes of screen in them. From quarter inch to eighth inch to window screen below. And each one is going to separate out different sizes of seeds or chaff. And what I want is to save everything that comes out of this gap. So at the bottom of this chute I have a bucket that will catch hopefully most of the grain that's going to come through. So let's have a look and see here. And now I can use, on the side here I've got a handle, I have to shake it. And I'll find it helps to kind of remove the stuff and move it up. And now, my angle isn't very steep so I get a lot that gets stuck up here. And a lot of this is chaff but we'll get rid of that on the next go through. Alright, now I have my bucket of mostly similar sized chaff. And then underneath are a whole bunch of seeds that are kind of hard to see. Okay, and now I have a widowing tower. So essentially what this is, so a fan sucking in air, it blows it up this tower and then back out so there's good wind coming out right here. Now what happens is I pour the chaff and the wheat into this hopper. And it has a little door, a choke door, that I can adjust here so it'll just let out a trickle of the chaff and the wheat. And the seeds will drop down in here. And as they drop, the wind will blow the chaff up and out. And down here, the heavier wheat seeds will fall and drop. There's a screen here that catches them and then drops them into this bucket. This is a more, a fancier way to do it than you could. I could just sit with a bucket underneath the fan and then pour the other bucket. And then that needs a lot more attention and time. This only should take one or two passes and the grain should be clean. So at this point it's pretty clean. At this point it's pretty clean. Got some here. I can just kind of... I've finally gotten a system that I think is working pretty efficiently so I'll share that with you. So the first step I take is I use my trusty threshing tub here and I grab a sheaf of wheat. I've done this different ways in other parts of the videos you'll see where I can feed this directly into my thresher but I'm finding this to be a more efficient use of my time. So what I do is I hold it over my bucket by straddling it and then I just cut the heads off. Now if this wheat has been bundled really nicely and all the heads are on one side I can get by with just cutting the top half or so of the sheaf into this bucket. But in many cases I end up having to cut this wheat into quarters and just throw it all in because the heads get dispersed throughout the entire length of the sheaf. In future years I might make more effort to make sure that everything is aligned in the field because that would mean I have to thresh half the amount of wheat or half the amount of straw. So I still have a lot of heads in here. Sometimes if there's only a few I'll pick them out. I'll take this bucket full of cut up straw and drop it into my thresher. So I can do about half a sheaf at a time. Otherwise it gets overloaded and it won't thresh properly. There's not enough space in there. Close that up. Turn on two switches. I turn on the fan which I'll show you in a minute. The fan blows the chaff away as it falls out from underneath saving me the winnowing step that you've seen elsewhere in the video. And then I turn on the motor. Thirty seconds seems to be about plenty. Then I can check, look through and find some heads and just give them a feel. If I try three of them and they're all threshed then I consider it to be done. Yep, all the heads are off. So now this just goes in my wheelbarrow. And the process continues. I'll add more. To the thresher machine and start it back up. So what happens here is. Wheat and chaff fall out of this vent here in the bottom of the thresher. They hit here and the chaff is blown away by this fan. Which I have running on the highest speed. This is a trash can lid. This is my food trash can that never actually gets trash on it. It's just a big container of food safe plastic that I keep clean. And this ends up obviating both the sorting that you saw. As well as the winnowing for the most part. I'll have to winnow it a couple times. But I don't need to use my big winnowing tower. I have all this extra equipment that I don't actually need to use now. So that's fun. Anyway. So here let me turn this on and we can see it in action. And there's a little bit to toss out. But for the most part. This does a pretty good job with about 80 to 90% of the chaff I usually have to deal with. So. Makes pretty clean. And pretty quick work of the rest of the winnowing process. I take the half winnowed bucket or lid. And pour it into a bucket. And then later I'll winnow this for the remaining small amount of chaff that remains in here. So it's not fully clean. But pretty close. Just a couple of rounds of winnowing will get that ready to use. And now I'm in the garage. I'm building a stand that's going to go behind my stationary bike to grind wheat and other things into flour or other ground seeds. And now I'm going to try to push effort into the monstrous buddy that's launching a pre-adar and fais me fine. Okay, now what I have is my finished stand with my grain mill mounted here and my wheel V-belt that turns down there. So what I need to do now is connect the belt. So this is a variable length belt because this is kind of a long connection. It's about seven feet of belt that I need and most belts aren't seven feet long. Plus I'd have to cut a hole in this to get it through. So this variable length belt just seemed to be like the best solution to all of life's problems. Other than the fact that they are kind of annoying to get set up. But once they're set up they're great. They have less vibration supposedly than a regular belt. And again this is not a how-to blog so I'm not going to go through the exact way to deal with these belts because there are people with more expertise on them than me. But suffice it to say it's a whole bunch of links. A polymer plasticine type thing. And they link together in a pretty clever way. Got two there. Links through. It's got little notches. And they're pretty cool. So look up a variable or a link to V-belt on YouTube and you can find all kinds of videos about how they work and what they're about. Um... I'll link to one here if I get around to it. Alright. The nice thing is I can put it right through a hole without cutting a slot. Right? Because I have it in a closed hole in the wood. The fewer openings I have the less place for flour and other bits to get everywhere because everything that gets covered in flour will attract rodents. And then once you get rodents you get feces and urine. And then it makes it unsterile and unfit to use. So I really do want to keep this stuff as cleanable as possible. Having a more enclosed housing is one way to do that. There we go. Let's see. Hey, it's turning the right way and everything. Oof. Now we have to limit this to 300 RPMs. So now I need to count how many RPMs this takes for every spin of this. Cool. It's only five. That's awesome. That means I can turn at a much more comfortable pace. Alright. Oh yeah. That's much better than using my arm. And now I take that cleaned grain that I just cleaned. All these bits of wheat. And I'm going to put them on top of this hopper. So burrs on my mill. I've kind of jerry-rigged a little hopper with a spout here. It could be a little more permanent once I get it exactly how I want it. But for now what do with this. And again this can be run by a bicycle. And all winter I anticipate I will be running it with a bicycle so I can have some exercise when I'm stuck inside on the snowy, snowy days. But for today I'm going to run it on an electric motor powered by our solar panels and battery. So now I will fill this hopper with about three quarts of grain. Now usually I'm only going to grind this right before I use it. So I'm about to use this flour. Otherwise I just keep it in the berry form in these buckets in my basement. But since I'm going to use this flour I'm going to grind it now. So It will be hard for us knowing the paper I brought that積 them forever. How much happens there until I use older it? And when I use marble work I use the ground and speed. garbage going by Okay, now it's time to use the flour. And so this is some of the flour I ground. And this is not whole wheat flour, this is whole grain flour. And I'm finding that it is much more difficult to bake with than white flour that you buy at the grocery store. The main reason is when you're baking with white flour and you knead it, right, we all, most of us know that kneading it forms the gluten which are chains. Kind of think of them as like elastic bands that form in the structure and that's what gives it that bready consistency that we like. The bran and the germ and the other things that are left in the flour act like little glass shards. So imagine you have a bowl full of rubber bands that you want to make the gluten, right, and then you throw a bunch of glass in there and you knead it, it cuts all those bands to bits. And so you don't have that nice gluten structure that you generally would want. So I've had to adapt and I still don't have a good handle on baking with this yet so I'm still learning. One tip that I did learn is that when you mix it, instead of putting your water and your flour together and mixing right away, you want to let it sit for about 10 minutes and that weakens and breaks up the bran and the other bits that would otherwise break the gluten down. It causes them to soften and breaks less of your gluten. So that's one tip I've learned from the internet but I still have a lot of adjustments to make in my usual bread making process. So, I'm just going to make a simple sourdough and here I have my sourdough starter that I mixed last night. It's active. So I'll take my mixing bowl, my scale, and now I'll add a pound and a half of the whole grain flour and then I'm going to add a half a pound of white flour just to give me a little extra wiggle room. And then I'm going to add four ounces of this starter into a well in the middle and then a tablespoon of salt. And since this is a two pound loaf, I'm going to do about 70% hydration. So I will add a pound of water, that's 50%, and then another five ounces of water and then I'll mix that up real lightly just so it's not mixed in and then I'll let it sit for ten minutes before kneading. Alright, it's been ten minutes. And instead of just letting this mixer run or kneading it continuously, I'm just going to knead it for a minute and let it rest for a minute, knead it for a minute, let it rest for a minute. That in effect has the same effect as kneading it for ten minutes if I do that on-off on-off for ten minutes. It's going to be the same effect. It's going to be the same effect. It's going to be the same effect. Now instead of using my usual kneading method, it's risen some, I'm going to just stretch and pull the dough, trying to build up the gluten and the structure. If I knead it, I'm afraid I'm going to overwork the dough really easily just because of the different nature of this. So just draw and pull over. I'll let that do a little more rising now. And now I'm oiling up a pan. Drop the dough into it now that it's risen again. Never mind the noise of the fire truck being pushed around the floor over there. So the goal is to give this a little bit of a structure, so I'm using the pan. I haven't gotten to the point where I have enough control over this dough to make a free-standing loaf. But hopefully the pan will give this enough form that it will keep all of its nice bubbles inside. Let's see if I can shape this thing. It's pretty wet and I don't want to overwork it because we'll just tear all the gluten. That is one wet loaf. I guess I could challenge, reduce the challenge on myself by making a drier loaf. Alright, let's get a flour covered tea towel over that to rise. They also say that it's possible to sieve out white flour from this and you lose about a third of the content. So I haven't tried this before but let's see. Yep, that would do it. So here's all that bran and germ and other things left over from the grinding process. So I can make bran muffins and other hearty things by adding that back in. And then here's the white flour. Oh yeah, definitely. So maybe I will try baking with the white flour someday. But for now, let's mix it all back in. Okay, it's as risen as it's gonna get. 425 and fingers crossed. Well, definitely not my greatest loaf of bread. Needs workshopping to work with this new flour. Is it getting better? Are you learning? Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah, it's just that. So used to cooking with baking with regular flour. I did try and sift some of it out and I totally can do that. So I just... Have you tried doing the overnight? Yeah. No meat with it? Yeah. Same thing. Yeah, because I can sit over for my little bit. It's all that sharp, you know, the bran and the stuff and the gluten. You know what I should do is try and do just a... I'll sift an entire loaf and do just white bread from the stuff that I've harvested just to see how that goes. And then I'll have all that bran we can do things with like, I don't know, bran muffins. Which are yummy. Ugh, melted over the sides and now it's stuck in here. Ugh, finally. Yeah. This one took a beating. Ugh. I mean the bread... the crumb itself looks fine but the top... Well that was not my finest baking hour. I used to work in a bakery. I can actually bake bread. And I have other videos that I'll link to here and here about making sourdough starter and also baking bread. So have a look at those for a little more successful... Ugh! Yeah. A little more successful baking. Yeah. Well that's all we have this week. Thanks for joining us for this episode of Foodmageddon. I hope you learned a little bit about what it takes to process wheat into flour and the amount of work we take for granted when we buy a 10 pound bag of flour at the grocery store. Wheat's been a... this has been a goal for me for years to do this. So I've been really excited and enjoying it for the most part. But I imagine that if I had to do this every year, it would be... it would become quite the chore. Anyway, thanks for watching again. Don't forget to subscribe. Share this with your friends.
