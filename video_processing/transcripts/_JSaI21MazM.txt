 oh shoot hey y'all well it's october the second we are a few days into our calving season and we have a few calves on the ground but it's also time for us to finish up our hay season for the year so i'm standing in front of one of our smaller fields that my husband has just started cutting it does not look great even though we do have a great stand of johnson grass but we need to clean these fields up and get done so i want to take you through the process of how we cut ted rake and bell our hay here we go and that's my boy cutting hay for the very first time riding with his dad awesome go wesley go and this is the good stuff y'all this is the good stuff i always love the way hay looks when it's first cut i'm just gonna follow that little blue tractor and show you some tedding so we used he used to use the big tractor but he acquired this little tractor last year and it works perfect for this so for three days of its life its first three days of life if this calf is not nursing it's laying under this tractor and i really hate to break its little heart but i'm about to have to go rake and i'm gonna need my tractor back little buddy so the time has come for the best most important part of the hay making process which is raking and baling raking because it's my job and because if you don't rake right then you don't have good bales and in the end that's like the most important thing so the pressure's on today my ride has new bigger wider tires i haven't driven it yet and the pressure is on because i'm not gonna be able to turn as tight as i usually do and sometimes i've been known to turn too tight anyway and you know like sometimes blow hoses and like hit the rake and stuff so today i can't do that or i'm gonna royally mess something up so here's hoping that i don't royally mess something up we'll see going back home because i forgot the radios guys really have you ever seen such a fine truck as this it's pretty awesome it's even got the whole heartbeat the whole heartbeat of america thing going on yeah radios and tea we can now go bail hay sorry bonnie you gotta stay here the sky's clouding up which is not good for making hay and i think little bit thinks there's a storm coming anyway here we go as i bump my head all right it's been a while hopefully i remember how first things first air on it's really hot today y'all like 80 80 something etc so Woo! Tight turn. I missed a little bit of hay, but I didn't run into my race with my big new tires, and that is more important. You can tell we're not going in straight lines yet. I make two laps around the field, and then I start pulling straight ropes. And so, with these new tires, I'm going extra slow around the corner. And so far, so good. But I can feel the stress. I can feel the stress in my body with these tires today. I just don't want to mess them up. Because if I mess up, it's not going to be bad. And it's too hot. It's too hot for a big mess. It ugly works. And it's just too hot. So, the goal is to stay in the tractor, pull in the rink, and not plug anything. So now, I'm going to start pulling straight. Right. It's too hot. Ah! But the important thing to do is to not be trying to video yourself. Find the video yourself. And remember to turn the wraith on when you make the turn. Take two. Hello, can you hear me? I think I'll just go out right here. Do you want me to go to the next film? We're going to Sally's first. Okay. Alright. This is not my favorite. Sally's. So every farm around here is named after somebody, like the person we called it from. This is a little farm. This is a little piece of land that we don't own or rent. She just lets us take hay off of it. But I have to drive down this Virginia pig path. Paved pig path. And I hate it. Because it's narrow. Not snarrow, but narrow. And if there's any traffic, it just, it makes me nervous. Anyway, here we go. To Sally. Another fun part. Another fun part of this little piece that's next to somebody's house is attempting not to run into the telephone poles. Oh, shoot. Okay, well, I did. My tire just hit the side of the race. But nothing broke. What is he doing? Oh, my gosh. He constantly makes fun of me for being on the phone. Oh, I thought he was talking to somebody. He's pretending like he's taking a picture of me. I thought I called him. Dang. He's doing a good job. He's doing a good job. And that is all she wrote. And one more film. We might do, we might not do. It's on what it looks like. That's it for today. Cookie at Carhey 2018. Nothing broke. Just left a little rubber on the rake. That's a pain. I do love my rake. One year. Wow. That's bad. One year with my self-folding rake. Would not trade it. So don't ask. Anyway. Bye. There we go. Well. That's a wrap. Pun most definitely intended. I think I'll go wash my hands now. And if I think about it, I'll come out here and try to clean my steering wheel sometime. Hey 18. In the books. Feels good. Feels good. Always feels good. To finish one season and roll right into the next. And that was another amazing pun. See you. See you. See you. See you. See you. Bye. Bye. See you. See you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Des sabes.
