good to go i bet you can hear me better so welcome to streams of collective consciousness this is a bi-weekly news live stream where i talk about sustainable fashion talk about environmentalism and social justice happens tuesdays and thursdays for from 4 p.m central time to 6 30 central time so about two and a half hours yes yes yes let me check the audio really quick see how everything is going let's see let's see let's see hello there's seven people in here jesus hi everyone fixing the audio i'm so excited to get into it today is actually the first time i have good wi-fi the at&t guy just left so i'm super excited to talk about so sustainable fashion environmentalism all the things so how it works let me move over to the canva so here is the cute little art that i made i always use this canva deck so feel free to take a look at this in my description it's a link it's free it's accessible so even if you like jump off later on and still want to know what happened for this week or last week just jump on the canva deck and look through if you're watching the recorded version you can always skip through these live streams are always saved on my youtube and i'm also on twitch it's a multi-stream so excited um so how it works is it's structured it's very structured i'm not gonna lie i'm type a i'm like very straightforward so you always know what i'm doing so basically i start off with single fashion news that's what i focus on that's like the bread and butter of the live stream then i try to take a break at five but i always forget i always forget and then i then talk about social issues any environmental things happening any positive news i cover on later in the half section of life in the live stream i do want to watch more fashion shows around six i always watch fashion shows but i always get copyright striked on youtube so i'm thinking about like doing like a 12 hour live stream on twitch where i watch all the fashion shows but that's like an extreme thing but i do want to watch fashion shows it's just the copyright music on there is always just uh so bad for the recorded version and then i get copyright striked and then no one else watches my live streams uh afterwards so yeah i'm still trying to figure out how to do that and then i do want to get into gaming i honestly feel like i'm not gonna end off with gaming today i'm probably gonna do more like gaming sessions so i'm thinking wednesdays and sundays from like 6 30ish or 7 30ish until like 10ish i game so that's gonna be super fun and then yeah here's the schedule oh my god i drank too much coffee i'm like swelling all the coffee that's like in my mouth but if you guys ever want me to talk about anything community submission form is in my description anything sustainable fashion environmentalism social justice whatever whatever you want me to talk about fill this out and i will take a look at it and cover it in the next live stream that is about news so next tuesday i'll most likely cover it if you do send me something i don't really look at links in the chat or anything like that i just i like to think about whether or not this would be a good idea for me to talk about um and then i always start with personal news so i'm actually in a really good mood today i think one of the biggest things i've struggled with live streaming honestly has been the connectivity issues so i've had very crappy xfinity basic essentials for a whole long while while living in a basement and if you know anything about like so many basic essentials or like basic internet it's just like very basic it's very basic like it doesn't reach any sort of location in the basement and so my wi-fi was always very trashy uh connectivity was always something that was making me really anxious when jumping on because i have no control whether or not it's going to work so now today i for sure know i got good wi-fi i got AT&T um and i can't afford it because i do spend a lot of money on the weirdest things i don't know if you guys know but i'm like someone that cares about sustainability about consumption but i'm also someone that buys a lot of knickknacks and i have knickknacks all across my room like even my window that's a perfect example i'm kind of lopsided today but if you look at my window why does it look like i'm on a downhill slant but if you look at my window there's a lot of knickknacks and that's just kind of a bad habit i have with over consumption um don't look at my frizzy hair but yeah i finally have good connectivity i think it's going to actually be a game changer in the education and the news that i provide in this live stream so like if you care about this live stream if you care about learning about sustainable flash and environmentalism all these things like having good wi-fi for me is like gonna work wonders for you to learn and like stay updated and um to jump on and be entertained hopefully i'm entertaining now that i'm like less stressed and less annoyed with the internet um i'm also very excited to have a pc i don't know how to work a pc but i am uh learning slowly for sure z's i don't know i'm for sure learning how to use the pc um but yeah that's just all work in progress it's a work in progress doing stuff online i started off not really knowing how to like live stream or anything so uh this is yeah just a huge huge improvement i'm really excited where i can take things um i've been live streaming for like four or five months i started in january yeah i started in january on youtube so it's been january february march april may june so six months it took me six months to improve my setup i've been changing the lighting the the audio i've been changing the internet stuff maybe you don't care but for me like it really is a huge huge improvement i never really thought social media could be something i could do or live streaming could be something i could do um i i'm still incredibly new to this but i think there is more need for more people like me to be online talking about like sustainable fashion or talking about the latest eco news talking about social issues and like making these things a bit more humanized because sometimes you can fall into like abstract theories or concepts or just like make all these things out as like more scary than they are and then just having someone like talk about it it's like okay like maybe we can like kind of analyze and and feel these things in a more sustainable way versus feeling like oh my god like we can't do anything or like it's all doom and gloom sort of thing so yeah i just just want to just want to talk about the news and like make it feel a bit better for everyone even though we're kind of in the hellscape but uh we can be in the hellscape together um but yeah oh the the tnt guy not to like feel like this is sponsored or anything i would never take corporate money but he was so nice he was so nice and he was so speedy um it was like the four hour process though like it takes four hours to like connect the internet which i didn't realize so i was just like in the house waiting because i'm anxious and i'm like okay does he need anything i was just in the kitchen i don't know if you guys ever experienced this but like when someone is doing something to your house i i'm always like what am i supposed to be doing right now am i supposed to follow them around am i supposed to be in the kitchen like they're installing the wires like what am i what's my role here you know so i was just in the kitchen on my laptop and at the end he was like i like this house i like the vibe i'm like cool it's like you're chill i'm like yeah thanks he was very extroverted and i was like not not really just saying much so i just didn't want to annoy him i just wanted the internet so bad i was like let me shut up and like not say much but yeah he was very nice very helpful so i got that all set up but um now getting into the news which i'm super excited about there's a lot of things happening and shia never feels too disappointed so there has actually been a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes with their ipos and they've been getting into new markets like japan but also they've been having some contentious issues with their protection laws i'm not a lawyer so i'm gonna read this article and try to understand it with you because i sometimes don't know what the hell is happening or what she is doing or what is being said in these articles but basically um apparently the european commission is asking the fast fashion giant to address a lot of issues including fake discounts and pressure shelling selling i mean selling pressure selling um so basically here in this article it explains that the fast fashion company must respond to the commission's findings within one month and to propose propose commitments for how it will address the identified issues and if she doesn't address these issues then a belgium france ireland and netherlands can take authorities or take enforcements uh to ensure compliance which could include fines oh hit them with the fines so i don't know what the issues are per se i don't know what they investigated but the european commission found the tea apparently oh i'm a poet okay so it says here from fashion dive that they must provide internal documents and detailed information about the potential sale of illegal products on its platform dang illegal products what would that be hmm also it wants to mitigate the commission wants to mitigate risks relating to consumer protection like user data as well as public health and users well-being interesting i've not heard of this before it's interesting i haven't seen this on social media or on tiktok or anything fashion dive if you're not familiar is such a great source for information i learn a lot from them and they don't have a paywall i think within fashion journalism and fashion news in general it's really hard to find reliable like trustworthy news so i highly highly recommend fashion dive um i've i've really seen really great articles written by them and they like link everything which i really respect because sometimes i'm like where are they getting these facts from but they're always really good with that um but yeah she is in trouble apparently they're saying they're planning to invest more than 15 million dollars in its product safety tests and compliance protocols i don't know what that means hmm but apparently she had completed more than 2 million product safety tests through third party testing agencies guys if i'm yelling in your ear you should turn down the tv because i cannot change the mic sound on my thing and i kind of don't want to kind of feel like yelling today kind of feel like yelling about sheehan and how much i hate them today okay so yeah they're not really specifying in the article what is happening so let's go back to the original one and see what what are these protection laws their articles do tend to be on the shorter side but they are good at giving like the general idea so yeah they're so the european commission okay here european commission is basically asking sheen to provide internal documents about its recommender system and the risks linked to the potential sale of illegal products wait didn't we already read that oh my bad okay so the consumer protection law investigation is complementary to a separate european commission investigation announced last year to examine sheen's compliance with the digital digital services act and the investigation also includes sheen's fast fashion competitor timu and resulted in two separate probes into timu so apparently they're facing sheen is apparently facing regulatory challenges from various countries including u.s vietnam and italy can we can we just boycott sheen the more i read the more i'm disappointed see i don't i don't know half of the things that they're doing but i know that they're not up to no good up to no good dang so sheen and timu have until july 12th to respond dang hmm i what are these illegal products that's kind of what i'm curious about what are they selling on there and they have to guarantee that users have safe predictable and trustworthy online environment have a safe predictable and trustworthy online environment as the laws require hmm is it because of their gamification i did notice that sheen has this like gaming vibe to it like oh if you spend this thing you get five dollars off this thing right here is this it and then you get flooded with ads and then i have to click out of every see this this thing i have no idea why they do this it's just i'm clicking out of things all the freaking time i'm like let me just look at the things i think this is what is being warned as like a mental health warning thing like here's a special deal i don't want a special deal sir and then this thing pops up how many things do we have to click this this 90 off dang why even sell it full price if it's just 90 off like where would it where why all these discounts see when i see 90 off or 50 off i'm just like how many people did they exploit like how many people literally were were uh dying over here out of exhaustion and uh were sweating in their garment factory for this stuff like we don't need we don't need this you don't need this but um yeah so she and atemu are now designated as very large online platforms by the commission and they have more than 45 million users per month dang imagine 45 million people boycotting both timu and sheen fast fashion would not survive man so that is what's happening with sheen and timu they're just under a lot of scrutiny a lot of uh demand for more protection of their users more transparency of their systems more traceability of their trades compliance by design ensure that they're have that customers are having a good experience online um and that they're not selling quinco anything illegal i do still wonder what is illegal products to be sold on sheen and so yeah sheen is working working on this apparently and the spokesperson actually communicated with fashion dive and they said we share the commission's goal of ensuring that consumers in the eu can shop online with peace of mind and we will continue working closely with the commission to ensure our compliance with the digital services act and it says we also like to reiterate that we're fully committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations in the markets where we operate says a timu spokesperson so i i do love this regulatory and legal challenges i i think we need more of this all across the board for the fashion industry i think the industry is highly unregulated and for the commission to be like yo what are you actually doing and can you prove it i think is actually going to be an example for all other brands like the the malls the brands the brands in malls like all those fast fashion brands that are not at the same level as she and timu hopefully they are aware of what's happening to to these two major ones and being like okay like maybe i should do better because the commission's on their ass but um yeah they even mentioned here that she has been accused of underpaying its factory workers and is also facing several copyright infringement complaints when a class action lawsuit and another action brought under federal racketeering laws yes yeah she is always in a lot of laws i do wonder what it's like to be a she and lawyer can you imagine being a she and lawyer lawyer sir we do not copy this design sir we are not violating the rights of government workers sir we swear we did an audit sir we are making sure that there is transparency in our supply chain sir we are for sure ethical yeah it would be i would i would be uh brain broken after a year of working there even within a week could probably quit who wants to be a lawyer for she and that's that's uh that's another good question i would love to interview a she and lawyer or some a lawyer that represents she and because the audacity that you have to be justifying their actions is the next level of like i want my money and i don't care how i get there to get my money um yeah but there's also a lot of other news about she and which is not surprising and then i'll move on to like actual sustainable flash and stuff because i just like to trash on she and i also like to track them because i like i said um they're like the worst players in the industry and we need to know what's happening to them and if we don't know what's happening to them we're just uh i guess mindless consumers or that's what they call us mindless consumers if you don't know what's happening so you're welcome i guess okay this is a heavy website okay so it says it says exclusive she and working towards hong kong listing after london ipo stalls now talking about stalling is my wi-fi glitching now or is it this random website no ant don't feel me ant don't fail me jen says hi jen the alchemist i love the name i love the name hello i haven't seen you in the chat before so thank you for commenting appreciate you being here but going back to this crappy website that's glitching me out oh i hate crappy websites blah blah blah blah blah so apparently xian is going to hong kong and getting an ipo there then plans to go public in hong kong within this year so she plans to change venue in absence of chinese regulatory node don't know what that means i'm not that smart with chinese regulatory node as a as a basic consumer i have no idea what they're talking about i'm not gonna lie let's just read this part and like try to understand what the heck is going on i'm not gonna pretend that i have any idea what this is no wait my wi-fi message youtube is not receiving enough video to maintain smooth streaming adnt what are you doing ah okay maybe it's this website it's juicing it up it's juicing up my usage okay i said okay let's speed run through this so she is working towards a listing in hong kong after the online fast but okay i'm kidding she is working towards a listing in hong kong after the online fast fashion retailer proposed initial listings uh public offering listing what initial public offering ipo in london which failed and now they're going elsewhere so the china founded company aims to follow a draft prospectus prospectus within hong kong stock exchange and the uh no gosh this website sucks i'm trying to read here okay so the china company dang and i'll have to start all over again see this is so annoying this is journalism and consumerism all in one moment of uh trying to learn so the china founded company aims to follow a draft perspective with hong kong stock stock exchange in the upcoming weeks so they are planning to go public in the asian financial hub within the year hmm uh oh i am not excited about this why why why hong kong why hong kong why hong kong youtube give me the answers i don't pretend to be smart i look for the answers hence studios okay she is working towards a listing in hong kong tell me why oh it's been happening okay cnbc i see you they're finally talking about something procrastination no no not ads skip to list in hong kong not london this year with the company aiming to file a prospectus in coming weeks that's according to reuters which says the fast fashion giant is eyeing up the listing in asia after its proposed london ipo failed to secure the approval of chinese regulators cbc has approached shian for comment i gotta say i was pondering this the other day in terms of why would you list on the london market so much scrutiny now as to where it makes its products and whether that should be attracting more tariffs and whether these very cheap products should be let into developed markets upending local commerce and that of course has come through from the trump tariff threat the regulator domestically is the csrc i do wonder whether they are somewhat of a guardian angel here protecting shiim from being exposed to uh some of the scrutiny of international markets so perhaps protecting face and also fortune for the company face in the sense that maybe it wouldn't get the same level of attention that it had desired originally when it was going after a london listing don't forget that the scale down from a us listing uh previously back to a hong kong listing where let's face it there are fewer questions asked i've been to press conference in conferences in hong kong you often have a speech you don't necessarily have the q a from journalists and in the backdrop you've now got a company that is trying to put production facilities in a warehouses at least in vietnam and i think there's going to have to be more of that to protect the business model in future so you would want to have fewer questions is my point if you were shiim from here to protect yourself i think you've also got the pull of a hong kong listing when you look at cattle and the listing uh earlier this month and how well it went went it was the biggest global ipo in 2025. there's um a lot of investors saying hong kong is going to be the hottest story from a market perspective this year we just had a guest yesterday um touting the uh the the opportunity in hong kong here so yes i mean she and has are you could say scaled back they've um transitioned their goal away from new york and now seems to be away from london to hong kong but is it going to end up being a positive for them that they end up listing in hong kong given the momentum behind the hong kong market here certainly a win for hong kong i would say but the the problem i think with the flip side here for the london market is that she and was meant to be almost reset the idea that technology companies could list in the uk on the back of delivery which was somewhat of a flop or the pushback from manager from fund managers about the esg side of the business i think this time around uh that you've got now issues that we haven't got a big name like that coming to market it was almost going to break the seal yeah she and deliverer are such different beasts though and the reason that she and won't be listing in london if this story proves to be true so different i mean it's obviously a very geopolitically sensitive story here um but certainly an interesting one very interesting indeed it's caught in the attention of major news places which is a good news to keep us informed because it's it's really rare to see fashion being covered in news sites and it's really needed to understand what is happening i do wonder whether there is more things that we can watch based on this if we can just look at the keywords look at the keywords routers a case like this no capitalism today blah blah blah ads ads ads ads blah blah blah sheehan is working towards a listing in hong kong after failing to get approval from chinese regulators for its proposed ipo in london that's according to three sources one source said the china founded online retailer aims to file a draft prospectus with hong kong's stock exchange in the coming weeks the others added sheehan plans to go public within the year in march sheehan secured approval from british regulators for its london ipo and expected to get a green light from chinese authorities but a source said the fast fashion giant has seen an unexpected delay and limited communication from the china securities regulatory commission sheehan and the watchdog did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment the firm had originally pursued a listing in new york to access a wide pool of large western investors it aimed for legitimacy as a global rather than a chinese company a separate source said the london ipo was complicated by allegations of cotton use from china's xingshan region sheehan says it has a zero tolerance policy for forced labor and child labor in its supply chain but such claims could have risked embarrassment for beijing according to the source they added tensions with the us over trade also made chinese leaders more wary reuters reported in february that sheehan was due to cut its valuation in a potential london listing to around 50 billion dollars that's almost a quarter less than the 66 billion dollars valuation it achieved in a 2023 fundraising deal sheehan wants her money sheehan wants her money oh my god they're doing anything they can guys we didn't get into london let's get into hong kong it just it feeds onto this vibe of desperation of like just looking at any possible solution to get what they want which is money capitalism let's make those bottom line goals let's make these shareholders happy god if they didn't originally want hong kong just leave them alone that's my logic that's just my logic can you tell i don't like capitalism oh my gosh my hair is so frizzy by the way it's it's very very humid out here in illinois and it's bothering me sheehan and humidity same level of annoyance right now they put both pains and the oh gosh but very interesting turn of events very interesting turn of events we're gonna take a deep breath and move on to the next news bit because we'll be following sheehan and their shenanigans i will make sure of it so that we know how horrible these power players are so that we can make better fashion choices and i am sure we already don't shop from them but it is still good to know because they are leading the charge of how terrible a fast fashion brand can operate yes they are the villain we must not let them become well i don't even know what i'm saying we must not let them win okay so let's see i love how i can live stream and just mess up and like wing things as i go this is the beauty of live streaming this is why i like live streaming because i can mess up and y'all are still listening to me you have no choice unless you click out but um yeah i trust you guys want to learn with me so also okay so she oh back to sheen okay i did want to talk about this before i move on but this is a piece that i've been seeing all over social media media maybe you've seen it on linkedin maybe you've seen it on instagram maybe this is your first time seeing it now but someone called emmanuel made this very cool rp showcasing the waste i need to sign in showcasing the waste that sheen um produces and it's like working off of a ad because as we know fashion is advertising and a billboard ad so yeah very compelling visual very compesual compeshing compelling visual i think it was done by ai not gonna lie if it is i i don't like ai so uh maybe next time don't use ai but yeah very compelling visual that just illuminates what's going on because it can promote this idea of fashion and beauty and this is like actually what's happening you're just creating trash man you're just creating trash and here is the caption i really love the caption so let me read it to you let me get my freaking face out of the way okay so it says an uncomfortable truth sheenna didn't just build a fashion empire built a momentum or oh it built a monument to excess says anewen so stop wasteful spending with fast fashion that ends up in landfills after one wear instead invest in tried and true advantage that has with with stood i cannot read sometimes with stood the test of time and still offers a unique style and quality so please shop vintage and put those dollars to work in your community yes sir we will be having a sidewalk sale tomorrow oh nice sidewalk sale for two dollars i'm gonna go vintage store where's it at i wanna go i love a good vintage sale a to vintage psi nice doesn't say where they're at that's fine it's okay it's okay it's okay it's okay i don't need stuff anyways i don't need it i don't need it oh don't look at my music oh guys look at the anti-capitalistic book of fashion if you guys want a good audiobook or a good book in general i highly highly recommend that the anti-capitalistic book of fashion by tansy e hoskins i am using the premium version of spotify so what that means for me is that i get to download these books and listen to it when i'm not online or on wi-fi which is so great when i'm like driving my car or when i'm like shopping in the store and just don't want to be bothered with anything else and i have a terrible phone plan so um i i don't really have data so i just kind of use spotify for when i'm offline and i usually go to spotify to listen to music or whatever so highly recommend if you like something to learn about or you think about when you're shopping or driving or um just vibing in life you know just plug in an air pod and there you go you got a very interesting book and it's very nuanced it's a very long book i'm on track seven track seven and every track is like an hour so and there's 14 tracks so it's like 14 hours worth of really good knowledge and it's very intersectional talks about the nuances of capitalism how it's connected to colonialism how it's connected to very ugly ugly roots of greed and exploitation um yeah it's a very very very very dense listening session so it's not for like very casual listening i would say but like if you're bored and like want something to kind of like learn from it's a perfect perfect uh book so highly recommend i'm always reading it by the way i'm always digesting this so i have both the physical copy and then the audio copy also nothing i'm saying is ever sponsored i'm actually just talking just talking to talk no one is paying me nothing this is coming from my heart no one bought my soul today um and i love five seconds this number there you go i've been listening to english love affair over and over and over again i am just a girl i'm just a girl that carries okay so oh don't look at my screen okay so we're gonna go back to the news but yeah very interesting shien billboard visual illuminates the truth but uh let's move on let's go to more news so have you guys heard that alta is turning employees into influencers why am i still down here i'm in the corner as a latina i cannot have myself in the corner any longer i don't increase the brightness my room looks dark okay so alta is turning employees into influencers i would hate to be a alta beauty worker if i had to be an influencer jesus another heavy website it's starting to glitch as soon as i put this website on but here it says alta beauty isn't just cool with its employees making social media content on the clock it's paying them to do it and this article is by tube filter if you want to stay up to date with content stuff like uh the latest news on youtubers and twitch rumors and stuff like that tube filter man and their newsletter so good so good but it says the relationships between companies and employees who make content about their experiences working there has always been a tenacious one a few years ago employees were possibly more likely to get a call from the boss and hey stop that then in congratulations you're making our brand go viral but things have supposedly shifted during the pandemic with tick tock letting everyone from fast food staffers to fairs share their daily lives at work and now alta beauty is not just letting employees make social media content about working there it's also paying them for it so there is a new ambassador program which seeks employees who are already successfully making content about alta um and they call them alta beauties i'm laughing because this is kind of like not that serious but kind of silly and like it's kind of weirding me out alta beauties and basically how it works is that it pays them to make a lot of money to make two commission deliverables so two things um per month so per glossy what okay oh wait no that's part of the sentence per glossy okay by because glossy glossy explains these deliverables are usually themed around alta's current sale promotions and new products and category launches huh so it's about the products and their promotions and about their uh products and launches okay yeah product launches and promotions nice and these beauties also consult with beauty beauty what i cannot read today the beauties consult with alta okay the beauties consult with alta there you go helping it sharpen its own account social media strategy so what they're saying is to get help from corporate hmm okay beauties are allowed to make content on or off the clock oh please be it be on the clock wait do they get two salaries so let's say i'm a nolta beauty talking to corporate and there's a promotion and i can do this on or off the clock if i do this on the clock but i'm getting paid to do content do i get two paychecks now or is it better to do it off the clock because it guarantees an additional paycheck hmm right girls right big brain moment see what i mean or is it a two-in-one where you only get paid when you're on the clock and then off the clock you don't which would be highly unethical and i don't think they're doing that but let me see um associate manager stacy says we knew we had an untapped super we knew we had an untapped superpower with our stores associates yeah not only are they struggling to survive and barely getting a livable wage at alta but they got some untapped superpower meaning we could get more labor from them they know what's happening before we do okay kind of sounds stoggerish we know what they're up to we just need to get it what the heck okay lady you're really invested in your job she oh okay so alta chief retail officer amy says our associates are really the heartbeat of what we do what is this article our associates post and engage on all sorts of social media platforms wait honestly this is giving like stalker vibes our retailers are everything to us there are the heartbeats they aim they they post and encourage they are everything my gosh they are our biggest advocates and most passionate about what we do okay i don't know about you but i'm not vibing with this how would you join an ambassador program for the job you're already working at i just i feel like social media is to be i don't know to be fun to be yourself and then when you have corporate in your ear it's like brother is this fun anymore like brother i don't want to talk to amy about my strategy today like am i gonna get paid extra for this or i'm just gonna get more watched at work because of what i'm doing you know but apparently there's interest so 1500 associates applied when this was announced but uh for context alta has 50 000 50 000 what was that accent 50 000 total associates so out of the 50 000 total associates only 1500 associates applied can we get a calculator over here can we get a calculator let's get a calculator okay okay okay so 50 000 you're doing math over here divided by 1500 oh equals not had 33 percent of the total staff no 33.33 to be exact applied which is not bad i mean world or nationwide 33.33 dang like i say do about fans wait how much do they pay does anyone know how much all the beauty pays oh wait no i'm not supposed to use google i use ekojia not pluto geez not my search history i'm so into sailor moon right now don't judge me i'm 28. don't judge me everyone has their hobbies okay what was i looking up ultra beauty wage illinois i'm in illinois let's see let's see let's see let's see let's see i cannot type i cannot type plant a tree for me nice okay so where can i get a estimate 17 to 20 dollars okay okay that's not bad that's not bad like someone working in the store is what i'm looking for to clarify 2021 they were making about 10.75 damn that is old news okay i think they're just getting minimum wage average average associate average wage average wage that's the noise when i'm learning blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so it says here average ultra associate hourly pay in the united states is 16.44 damn god damn that's very little so many tabs okay so they're only making 16.44 and so 33 of them said yes i want to be part of this program but not everyone gets in oh okay it's exclusive then dang on top of surviving a minimum wage it's exclusive to get in and will only accept around 30 staffers for its first cohort y'all gotta be kidding me um so these staffers range in position from cashier etsy store manager with expertise in and around content um and they have to know hair styling makeup skincare and nail care oh my god that sounds like so much work ah would you be doing this if you're an ulta beauty associate you're stressed about money and you and you somehow get into this very elitist exclusive beauties ambassadorship would you do it a lot of them want to end up at corporate and marketing so creative social media or pr so i'd say the possibilities are limitless they should they could be ceo of ulta one day huh okay that was a big jump i was not expecting to read that i don't know i feel like they're making it like a huge thing while these people are like surviving but i do think ulta beauty wants to capitalize on tiktok and social media on the ground that they otherwise can't do with their corporate team or sitting in their pretty desks not knowing what's happening in the stores because they're in their pretty desk so i think they're just um basically sourcing content from those on the ground to get like quote unquote more organic authentic content now i don't think this is necessarily bad i think it's very strategic for those working in the corporate marketing realm in the high offices in the high fancy you know chairs and uh looking at their cute little portfolios of like marketing strategies but then the day like those that are on the ground that are making sixteen dollars and forty four cents do not deserve to be like yeah we'll probably pick you and we know you love ulta we know that there is a lot of talent but we'll only choose 30 out of the out of the what was it thirty thousand what was the number what was the number i forgot the numbers i hate numbers out of the 1500 that applied only 30 get accepted and there's this promise somehow that you'll probably make it in corporate marketing if you get accepted like yeah like give them something substantial and also like how are you paying them because i know they explain like oh you can either do this on the clock or out of clock or in on clock or out of the clock like whether you're in the store or not you can do this but like what is like the pay structure because it has to be ethical no matter how passionate you are like tell us how this is going to work so that not only the consumers are aware but also the people applying are aware and if you don't disclose that in a article or in a pr statement then like how is a general you know person gonna gonna understand this so ulta beauty like i would hate for them to use their passionate staff for their own benefit to source organic or authentic marketing content but it's just i just i really do want to trust that they're doing the right thing that they're doing this from a gentleman level but uh as we all know retail workers are often overworked they don't have any downtime especially in retail especially when there's customers asking you where the freaking makeup brush is at so if these dirty ambassadors do take this up like i do wonder what privileges or what time they'll be given to actually do this in the store as we face a lot of weird customers in the store you know like how can you like do a video and then like answer people's questions you know what i mean like how what's that tension look like but hopefully they're supported hopefully um they get more resources hopefully they get uh abilities to like move up in life and uh and show their passion for ulta i've been seeing ulta beauty on youtube and tiktok everywhere to be honest i'm not a huge like makeup makeup person i do care about clean beauty but i'm not someone that's like oh i'm gonna put blush on my thing right here what's this called um yeah i do want to get into makeup more though i i think it's a talent i think it's an art i'm not not that creative i feel like i'm a tomboy but i don't want to admit that i'm a tomboy because it just sounds bad to be like oh i'm a tomboy i feel like i'm a very feminine person so i don't know but i do have tomboy tendencies i'm like very darn down to earth i think that's what i'm saying i'm a very down to earth person um but i i like casual like relaxed fits i like things that are comfortable i like things that are easy i'm always wearing like men's shirts so i'm kind of like a tomboy in nature but like i my pinterest board man my pinterest board is so different from what i actually look like and dress like um so i just kind of need to manifest my pinterest maybe maybe maybe that's what's happening here i need to dress like my pinterest board here i'll show you my aesthetics before i move on to the next article because i have been going on a bit of tangents but here is my pinterest i want to dress like my pinterest board i want to look like this it's just i can't look like this i i feel like i have a very feminine energy or feminine desire to look a certain way but i look like a tomboy so i want to look and be immersed in in this sort of world and like have the makeup looks and the the vibes and stuff there's no makeup looks in this one i do have a makeup board but this is a this is it but guys i do need to work on my makeup so i need to uh i need to manifest my inner baddie see okay so yeah that's that's a bit of my style a bit of my style but for the old type beauties out there you guys are you guys are a next level i can't understand yet okay so we're gonna move on i've been going on tangents okay so here we are going to talk about how tick tock bans skinny talk this may be a bit triggering if you have body issues or struggle with mental mental stuff around weights so just a little warning but basically tick tock banned skinny talk um i don't know much about skinny talk to be honest i'm not on that side of tick tock but it says tick tock is taking action against posts that depict the effects of disordered eating so amid mounting pressure from regulators affect affiliated with the european commission bite dance own app has banned the skinny talk hashtag which was used to disseminate videos that perpetuate harmful beliefs about body image um so skinny talk took off in april when the namesake hashtag hosted thousands of videos that celebrated unrealistic and unhealthy female standards so the skinny talk clips heightened broader concerns regarding the social media's industry's delish deletrius effects on teen body image a trend that can be seen through the long-form popularity of the diet pill and steroid like drug videos it didn't take long before skinny talk drew scrutiny from regulatory bodies clara chapaz france's minister of state for digital affairs brought the hashtag to the european commission's attention and chapaz called skinny talk unacceptable and urged the commission to crack down on toxic body image beliefs so tick tock quickly acquiesced to those demands and said we have blocked search results for skinny talk since it has become linked to unhealthy weight loss contents of tick tock spokesperson bow and low in a statement published on june 2nd um which chippa has cheered the move as a collective victory so this is not the first time tick tock has taken action to curb controversial body image content two years ago the app caused a stir among creators when it restricted videos that promoted semi-glutide drugs like a zempic as weight loss solutions and youtube has initiated similar crackdowns on its own platform while companies like meta and x have been criticized for relative inaction so tick tock's attempt to nick skinny talk is a good step forward but to fully address toxic body image standards and their effects on teenagers used the app has to do more playing whack-a-mole with dangerous hashtags is an imperfect solution one idea would be to take a page out of youtube's book by tweaking recommendation algorithms to surface fewer videos that could be tied to disordered eating and related ills the article ends off by saying with a new lineup of features tick tock is moving in the right direction on good morning american representatives for the app announced a new self-care tool for the for you page including a topic manager improved keyword keyword filters and an updated safety centered guide the popular app is becoming a healthier place to browse even if it will take more work to reverse negative body body standards interesting i do want to watch what they said in the good morning america segment so let me look that up because i think this is a very important news and information that we do have to digest and kind of think about because internet can be a very very unfriendly place very unfriendly place and i've personally struggled with body disorder issues so the less toxic ideologies and concepts online can really make a difference i personally know that so let's see let's see let's see let's see just kidding where shall we see this oh i don't see it give me the clip give me the clip and maybe it's in this one should we just watch a full hour of the good morning america let's just all much good morning america right now right here not the ads not the ads guys if i can't find it in this clip i'm probably going to move on do do do do do do do do uh speed run it guys let's speed run this okay nope can't find out there oh i'm looking at all the news right now taylor swift is low-key don't care cream is don't care um i don't know where it's at you don't know where it's at that looks like tiktok nope it's just a girl i can't find it guys i cannot find this news i just stereotype someone no no i can't find it so this was from two years ago so i'm probably going to move on um but that's good on them for going on good morning america and bringing more awareness about the harmful effects of tiktok and also just making initiatives to like make the online world a bit more safe and more uh accessible and not so toxic so yes there you go there you go okay so we're gonna move on i actually saw this tweet it's about a political dominant dominatrix that uses mind games to humiliate her submissives which reveals how she focuses her unique skills on right-wing men in order to turn them into socialists as an old article by daily mail but it went viral on twitter recently and i just found it very funny very weird um but basically back when this was published in 2018 it featured a girl called riba who goes by mistress rebecca who was 27 at the time and is a professional dominatrix as well as political science lecturer at central saint martin's in london and she apparently dominates white men especially on the right wing she is a socialist who has a mixed race and she admitted that she could never be mean to someone who wasn't white because the world is run by white men again these are all very controversial ideas um but uh let's see what what what she uh what she has to say man so instead of i kind of don't want to read this article but she basically relies on words and mind games to degrade her male clients and her work comes from a a frustration with men who indulge in fetishes that have no alignment with their everyday politics so i think she's just someone that has tried to do a lot of uh activism i guess in the past and this is just her route now or has been her route i don't think this is necessarily my path but as you can see here this is an example of what people would do to try to change people's mind i don't really think it's effective to uh i would say bully people into into your personal ideologies um i feel like there's some good good intent in trying to submit submit someone into your ideas or make them submissive under your ideas but i i i don't really think that you can beat people out of their values you know what i mean or you can't gaslight people out of their beliefs or you can't like trick them with mind games after a certain while you know so i just found that very interesting that uh dominatrix thought that she can like beat the values out of their head so even if they're a right-wing people like i don't think that violence really causes more ethics or more goodness or like more left-wing thoughts to emerge you know i feel like it just breeds more violence and more hate and more frustration um but those are just my thoughts my immediate thoughts i don't know why people turn into dominatrix i think there's an underlying tone of like wanting to control people or wanting to serve dominance or they find pleasure in pain or pleasure in a lot of uh torturous moments in life i i don't really understand their the logic here but teach their own hopefully she finds happiness and hopefully right-wing men become illuminated illuminated and more self-aware through their journey of life but i don't think i'm gonna go ahead and go and find them and beat them up they become leftists or socialists i don't think i'm capable of that either ways and that's a lot of work that's a lot of work to be honest i don't want to be dealing with them either ways i do think that it's more impactful to reach like-minded people that are not really taking action and motivate them to take action so hopefully they become like activists or community builders or host clothing swaps or um have more of an anti-capitalistic leaning i think we all generally care about each other and want to come together as a collective especially when we're so lonely and isolated given there's no third spaces which is like something outside of like work and home like we want to congregate we just don't have that and we become isolated so i just always encourage people to come together and and just be with each other in a wholesome platonic way and uh find joy and find resistance through that process i just don't necessarily think we need to waste time with right-wing men um but if they're up in our space if we need to defend ourselves we might as well engage but usually honestly right-wing men come to us they come to the left list leftists to to you know disturb the peace and uh harass them sadly enough and i think that's when we can be like yo you want a whooping right now like you want some uh domination right now i think that's when it's justified to like self-defend yourself but uh i'm not gonna go out and seek them but to to this political dominatrix that's a very interesting angle no judgment on her but that's a lot of effort man that's a lot of effort hopefully maybe it works there's no guarantee you can't guarantee someone's gonna be whooped out of their senses um but uh you know you can always try you can you can have your methods i guess be experimental here and there but yeah like that went viral on tiktok or i mean on twitter and i was like what am i looking at right now what is going on oh my god but we're gonna move on i like to keep it wholesome over here um as we talk about anti-capitalism but i do want to move on and talk about some other luxury fashion news too because i like to keep up to date with like who is our latest colonizer in the fashion industry and that is jonathan anderson who's going to lead the charge and dior he's going to be at the helm of both the women's when women's men's and hot couture house so that's what that's the dude that's the dude that's going to dictate our next collections there you go there you go i don't know much about him do you guys know anything about him because i have no idea who this man is yeah it looks like your average joe mr joe mr jonathan anderson is he cool like does he does does he do good stuff i want to feel like a queen when i wear dior now will he do this for me will he make me feel like a queen let's see let's see not the ads blah blah blah blah blah okay dior will appoint jonathan anderson to head its women wear designs and haute couture the lvmh owned label confirmed monday he will take over from maria grazia chiuri it further widens his role at the fashion giant where he's already its menswear designer lvmh ceo bernard arno called anderson one of the greatest creative talents of his generation the french fashion house named the 40 year old as head of menswear designs in april the award-winning irish designer generated buzz around his previous role at lewey fashion critics were impressed by his quirky designs that caught the attention at the spanish label the move comes with the sector currently struggling to recover from a prolonged slump the luxury industry has been hit by china's property crisis and economic uncertainty in the u.s top luxury houses have bet on new design directions to help bring back shoppers bring back the money bring it back to us apparently he's talented okay okay can i get his portfolio is this an example of his stuff um i don't know if i want to watch this let's see it was not your traditional announcement this news did not come in the form of a your typical press release but rather during the 2025 lvmh annual general meeting and it was revealed that jonathan anderson would be the artistic director for dior menswear and just to backtrack a little bit kim jones left your earlier this year right after we saw the dior men's fall winter 2025 collection now of course we discussed this when it happened a few months ago we took a look at his last collection his swan song it was very obvious that this would be his last show and it was announced only after that he would be leaving we also covered recently how jonathan anderson was leaving loeve and how it has also been speculated for quite some time that jonathan anderson would be going to dior but during the annual meeting during the q a portion bernard arnault was asked who is taking over kim jones's position at dior and bernard arnault answered jonathan anderson's debut collection would be the dior menswear collection in june so again typically these types of announcements are in the form of official press releases but maybe it was fine to mention simply i switched my airpods out because i can't hear give me one second because it's been an open secret for so long and of course there's a lot of announcements that are happening this year but it's something that has been anticipated for some time of course this is a major move for jonathan anderson even though we've known this i think he's been elevated to this position rightfully so and i also appreciate how lvmh they hired a talented designer and they really invested in him gave him a chance at loeve they invested in his own brand and loeve has become a major fashion house so all the credit to jonathan anderson and i think this is actually a positive story now also an interesting note here because this was in the form of a question there was no follow-up as to what about the womenswear side because he was just responding to the menswear side what about womenswear now i don't know what is specifically happening i don't know if perhaps they're going to make a big announcement after maria grazia leaves dior and i think that's probably why it's being prolonged maria grazia curie's last show or at least it's anticipated it's likely going to be the collection i think it's a cruise collection in rome on may 27th probably around then or after that they're going to announcement that he is likely going to do both of course this is speculation here i'm just guessing but you know if this is a this is an old video so he was chosen for this the speculations have become truth it is major props to him dior is a very prestigious brand it is one of lvmh's top brands i think this is a testament to jonathan anderson and when bernard arnault was asked during the q a portion about his success as a ceo running the biggest luxury conglomerate and being able to still do it at 76 years old he mentioned one of the reasons why he's been able to be so successful is he's hired some of the best creative talent in the world and one of the names he lists is jonathan anderson that is a testament to jonathan anderson his work at loeve to become a billion dollar brand when he really did expand loeve it really i think made it a brand that we know for their leather goods for their own heritage for their leather goods their handbags things like that i also did a deeper dive on jonathan anderson when it was announced that he was going to leave loeve in that video i looked at his various eras at loeve as well as his handbags so check that video out in the realm of menswear i think he's going to do a great job i think loeve has such a strong menswear line i also think he's going to create a great men's bag or really unisex bag because i think the beauty about handbags they are unisex they can be for men or women she's glazing him over here okay okay got the vibes you got the idea okay let's see let's learn a bit more about him because i have no idea who he is he's been in the industry for a while huh mode story jonathan anderson by l let's see come on barbie come on barbie let's party code de la mode est à l'origine de tenues et d'accessoires iconiques et il vient tout juste de faire son mon triche oh i don't know how to speak french jete moa jete moa rentra she's door i'm actually learning french on duolingo it's not been going good french is such a difficult language i know spanish and english and i want to pretend i know french it's just a very hard language to learn sadly enough okay i think i'm gonna move on um i really don't like luxury fashion to be honest and i'm not gonna glaze designers hopefully he comes out with empowering collections and is creative in his own sense but do we need more stuff do we need more stuff do we need more stuff that is the real question here is the world has enough clothing to close the next sixth generation and obviously that is coming from fast fashion but i do think luxury fashion influences our trajectory it influences uh what's gonna happen in fast fashion so we can't discredit luxury fashion to have nothing to do with what's happening fast fashion and i feel like luxury fashion is so overpriced but like do we really know where it's coming from half the time no there has been there's been controversies that it's been made in often unethical locations and not been so sustainable or it hasn't been made by artisans so we need more transparency and accountability and sustainability in the luxury industry in general because look at what's happening in the industry there's clothing in landfills there's so much clothing this is in chile there's dumpsters and dumps and piles and piles and piles of clothing that they don't even know what to do with it and it takes 200 years to disintegrate polyester man why do we make plastic based materials for it to take hundreds and hundreds of years to decompose like what are we doing i don't care if it's luxury i don't care if it's fast fashion if it ends up in the landfill it's the same thing it's waste it's wastefulness like let's just love clothing no matter if it's luxury or fast fashion because look at what's happening it's affecting so many beautiful locations like chile and it's always hurting the most vulnerable it's always hurting the most poor i bet your butts that no one wants to live next to a textile dump no one wants to be surrounded by clothing that's being lit on fire so that they can get rid of it they're inhaling that odor they're inhaling those toxic fumes those chemicals no one wants to go through this no reasonable reasonable person wants to like suffer because some white person didn't want their their clothing anymore now sometimes we think okay we donate to the thrift store that's fine but a lot of times thrift stores can even sell what is being donated only like a certain percentage is actually sold on the floor a lot of it is actually donated to these companies that then export them to different countries and they usually end up in the global south quote-unquote like developing countries like chile they don't even want it it's just they're kind of forced into these unfair contracts and then they're like what are we supposed to do with this this is very bad quality and then they just end up burning it they're burning it uh see even chile chile is like yeah let's uh pass a law where the importers have to be responsible for this because we're kind of done taking uh the responsibility of other people's uh wasteful practices it's almost like a kid is like yeah sure love it cute toss it away and they're like mommy mommy like be responsible for this and then the mom which is the united states is like yeah we're gonna blame this on this random chilean person yeah we're gonna talk to chile and coros them into uh making sure they deal with it chile had nothing to do with it i mean they can't decide to make business with the united states but like there's power dynamics there's a lot of um complications within the global supply chain that doesn't make things always the most fair for those with less power less privilege so i mean there is choice there but like how much choice do you have when there's a power and corrosion within the dynamic you know what i mean so it's not a very pretty picture for chile not a very pretty picture for the most vulnerable so yes i don't care about luxury fashion i don't i don't i'm sorry people i don't very pretty though very pretty and i love my fashion shows don't get me wrong but we shall move on we shall move on and learn more and progress and uh keep on moving on so there is a lot of conversations right now on the topic of target i've been seeing some tiktoks where people are like tiktok is going bankrupt tiktok is going bankrupt and all the comments are like bro stop coming up with your weird theories target is not going bankrupt um but yeah so retail dive said that the mass merchant mass the mass merchant is looking to turn around falling sales and declining customer sentiment but first it needs to diagnose its own problems which is i want to say dei diversity equity and inclusion that is a problem here but the article explains it's been a tough few months for target or at least that's how the ceo brian cornwall is describing it in a email to employees in early may so in the email which target shared with retail dive cornell recognized that silence from leadership has created uncertainty but added reassurance that we are still the target you know and believe in a company that welcomes all and aims to bring joy to everyone every day dude the prices at target are so expensive what joy is that they're scamming us i don't know that's just my personal opinion but i'm mexican american i'm the wrong demographic here so uh just saying but target is not standing still in the face of these challenges wow they're really making them out as a hero in this article they're not standing still so the retailer announced a slew of new brands or offerings over the past few months met with some on met with some well-known activists to discuss its dei changes launched a strategic refocusing initiative and switched up its executive team okay so they fired everyone and they're like let's start new dang okay did they did they uh fire the racist ones that's the question here but still analysts seem doubtful about how quickly the business can be turned around plus the work comes at the time uh major changes in u.s trade policy is happening which is upending retail planning aka tariffs and there's a lot more uncertainty in the retail industry right now but target has a plan why are they glazing them so uh let's see let's see yeah blah blah blah blah blah blah so what are they doing differently that's a good question we're not like other retailers which is precisely what consumers have told us they value about target wait why do people buy at target that's a good question actually because from my understanding can i just ran a second can i ran a second and from my understanding i've always seen target as the bougie version of walmart if you don't want to go to walmart and you got an extra buck go to target if you're white and want to feel a bit more elitist go to target if you like if you want to feel a little bit more successful in life go to target if you want to be poor broke and like everyone else go to walmart that's like been my mindset because you can go to walmart you can just go to walmart so like when you go to target like what's the reasoning here for me it's been like only only the americans go there only the people with money go there because everything is so overpriced and it's way too clean it's like i don't know how to explain it it's just like it's it gives like clean girl vibes but it comes with the price like the literal price of everything overpriced things so as a mexican american with my grandparents target has not been the demographic it's not been the demographic and if you take a stroll in the store you see certain races most of the time it's just one it's just one race and it's not mexican so um what makes them different i think it's a sense of elitism i think that's just me though if you if you uh shop at target good on you i guess i don't know you got that money what's your job but they say here where the place oh let me go back to the article they say where the place where the place to go to discover on trend affordable products that can't that you can't find anywhere else where the place they know will be a welcome break in their in their day their day whether they're scrolling or stroll i mean strolling the aisle or scrolling their feed okay okay so uh i think i know the solution here target don't be racist but i think their entire business is built on that like the vibes the vibes have not been uh that diverse for a long time so if they can change the vibes and i think uh they'll get their money back mm-hmm i know it's not that simple but you know it could actually really help getting getting your money back get those dei programs back in get those dei initiatives back in i do wonder if they're gonna bring it back though i do wonder hmm okay let me see if there's any news bits on this whether there's any updates on target and their dei initiatives because i mean if they want to make their money they should go for it like they should really uh work on that stuff you know how the pride marketing is toned down is it what i like the gay pride but what are brands doing are they messing are they messing this up too not only are they conservative but they're anti-gay pride gosh how many times can you mess up this year jesus these brands are uh just uh and they're on a little bubble huh many corporations are cutting their programs and pulling back on sponsoring pride events new york city pride has launched what it's calling a community fundraising campaign to make up a 750 000 budget shortfall and take a look at this survey from the pew research center earlier this year they asked people why they think corporations promote pride and as you see there 68 percent of lgbtq people surveyed said these businesses think it will help them and 54 of non-lgbtq people said the same but take a look at this only 16 percent of lgbtq adults believe corporations promote pride because they have a genuine desire to celebrate the community that compared to 13 percent of non-lgbtq adults let's bring in adrian pascarelli now she's a senior reporter for ad age who covers marketing uh in retail and finance great to have you with us uh this morning adrian so how widespread are these changes in the retail sector and is it just about rainbow logos or are there more noticeable differences out there this year well the pride marketing is very very quiet this year it's really quite sparse and that reflects as you said this overall trend about this fear of any of brands doing anything diversity related these these days um brands are afraid of backlash from conservative consumers they're also afraid of retribution from the current administration in in washington uh one one big brand that had previously been very vocal as a champion of pride initiatives in the past they told me that they are still engaged they're still sponsoring some uh some parades and things like that but they're not willing to speak about it on the record because of this fear of of broad backlash and i think that's the sentiment across the board and as we saw from that survey though if companies are trying to genuinely commute communicate to customers that they do care about these type of inclusion policies um how are those or which companies i'm wondering are actually leaning into this despite the resistance from the current administration well we are seeing a couple brands such as sephora american eagle and levi's and they're doing some marketing and pride related collections and they're not being as quiet about it as other brands they're posting about it on social media they're emailing some of their consumers sephora has a campaign with lady gaga and i think this speaks to their target consumer american eagle for example their target is teens and teens have said that they support uh pride marketing and diversity initiatives and we have seen in places like target experience business um declines because of their pullback of dei and and efforts to boycott them and i know that as we reference this survey in the intro we know that there's a sentiment of many consumers not taking this stuff seriously or not believing that corporations really um are doing this out of the goodness of their heart well why do you think there is that suspicion uh when it comes to companies trying to support pride well i think this overall pullback that we're seeing really shows that those companies that had had pride initiatives in the past they were really just rainbow washing i mean we're hearing that term quite a bit and it shows that maybe those companies that were promoting pride were not so genuine about that support it's not actually there in their mission all right adrian pascarelli great to speak to you about this thanks for joining us this morning thank you the pride washing why can't brands just actually be good brands i need to post more stuff on pride month i support i am in solidarity i actually do care about this stuff it is not just a marketing scheme okay but uh the brands like target and everyone else and you really need to do better like i think it's really important to show solidarity and to show support of all sorts of different people i think the the taking away of the dai initiatives and the reduction of pride of gay pride is uh it's very worrisome it's um very telling that our current president is changing the culture and um silencing a lot of critical voices and perspectives and making it harder for those that are marginalized or often oppressed to emerge and be loved and respected and be seen as worthy of living a safe and dignified life i think it's going to be a bit more of a struggle to have a fulfilling um and normal and safe everyday you know life so i worry i worry for those that are not white men that are conservative in their values because we're just being criminalized left and right whether whether you're gay whether you're black whether you're latina or whatever you are um undocumented or undocumented if you're not a white man with conservative values and you're just kind of like not that accepted right now very worry sometimes but i think that we can all play our part we can be you know more compassionate we can be a bit more understanding of different values different perspectives we can you know put on our pride shirts even if we're not necessarily in the pride world even if we're straight we can be like yo that's cool you know like let me let me wear my gay pride banner or put on the flip put put the flag in my room i'm but uh this hate this hate that i see is very worrisome worrisome and makes my head literally like fog over um i always like to say it's gonna get better but mr trump is not making it very easy for for the world to get a to get better so i think uh just being kind to each other in the ways that we can even if it feels very very very small in comparison to other damages done on us is uh necessary it's very necessary to be kind and remember that we're all just people and everyone deserves a good dignified safe life i don't care if you like boys i don't care what your race is i don't care how much money you got we all deserve a good life we all deserve a good life not just the white men not just the white white women who believe in christianity and are republican they're part of the universe they're part of the collective and um all this hate is just so unnecessary so unnecessary oh gosh but there's a lot more to cover and i shall all progress onwards and let's just talk about this before i start crying about how hateful and spiteful people are but uh yeah adidas is actually facing a lot of troubles right now it did have a lot of good uh intention last week when it banned kangaroo skins from their shoes but now they're in a lawsuit because it does apparently it apparently does not own all of its stripes so and let's let this load let's let this load so fashion dive actually covers this where it says the footwear brand is asking a federal judge to confirm that two of its sneaker designs don't infringe on adidas three stripe trademark so steve madden is essentially like making sure it's not a company copyright infringement on adidas so steve madden is suing adidas well that took a turn weren't didn't this imply wait what so from what i got from this is steve madden is making sure that they're not copying from adidas but then over here is like steve is suing adidas okay that's a good turn that's a good turn okay so steve madden is suing adidas because there's some anti-competitive efforts there to monopolize common design features in the fashion industry so i guess steve madden is kind of like dang adidas i can't even use three stripes they're gonna sue you now because how am i supposed to compete with you if you got that trademarked i think that's what's happening so in court documents filed last week steve madden asked the court to confirm that two of its sneaker designs the viento and ganos don't infringe on adidas trademarks both are low top lace-up sneakers that feature two non-parallel stripes so attorneys for steve madden said the company is tired of being targeted by adidas regarding footwear that bears no resemblance to adidas trademark three stripe design and further argue that no customer is likely to believe the sneakers are associated with adidas so adidas has a federal trademark protection on a three parallel stripe design in specific locations on certain items of clothing and shoes attorneys for steve madden said adidas has complained about the designs on steve madden's viento and gano sneakers which include a divergent band design and a k design respectively adidas filed a request in april to extend its time to ex to oppose steve madden's trademark application for the k design and its lawyers reached out to steve madden about concerns over the divergent band design per the complaint so variations of two bands and footwear are common in the fashion industry steve madden said in the complaint which also includes an image of several sneakers with two band designs from labels like converse vega tommy hilferger and bailey so simply put adidas does not own all stripes and should not be allowed to claim that it has a monopoly on all footwear that includes stripes bars bands or any shape having four sides parallel straight or not attorneys for steve madden said in a complaint for example these are the ganos and here's the viento um so adidas has sued steve madden over stripes before dang okay adidas getting getting a little bit get over here i want my stripes man no one else can have my stripes in 2002 in 2002 the germany based company filed one complaint over a four parallel stripe design and another one over a two parallel stripe design per the complaint so the two lawsuits were combined and both parties reached a sediment settlement in 2003 damn they go back man they want them stripes so steve madden is seeking a jury trial and the latest complaint which was filed in the u.s district court for the eastern district of new york the footwear brand also is asking for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and ruling that states no and what and ruling that states no unfair competition between the companies so there's no unfair competition basically okay cool an adidas spokesperson declined to comment adidas is like yeah i ain't talking these are my stripes they're my stripes guys um so steve madden isn't the only brand that adidas has targeted with litigation over its three stripe design adidas sued thom brown okay in year-long litigation over the use of stripes both in the u.s and the uk ultimately judges ruled in favor of thom brown in both instances damn i'm fighting dang dang dang dang drama drama over stripes who knew wow the fashion history is so funny like that that's my stripe no that's my strap i want to sell my shoes with the stripes no they're like mine and what the heck hmm let's listen to this Let's listen to some lawyers on YouTube. Heck yeah. Heck yeah. Hi, welcome to BL Business Branding. I'm your host, Nick Martinez, and here with my co-host, Isabel Wadsworth. Today we're going to talk about a trademark dispute between Steve Madden footwear and Adidas over the three-stripe trademark they have for their shoes. So here we're going to kind of dive into the history of Adidas' marks and then what Steve Madden is trying to do, and then Steve Madden's kind of allegations of unsavory or anti-competitive business practices, and then kind of try to find the line between when something is taking inspiration from a design versus when you're infringing on their protected mark. Right. And so why don't we just jump right into Adidas' well-known, pretty famous three-stripe mark. Yes. Everyone, I would say, knows what an Adidas shoe looks like. I don't think, you know, that's a little bit of a generalization, but I think that's fair to say that, you know, pretty much everyone is familiar with this brand and has been for several years. It's a brand with a lot of history. It has established itself as a truly strong brand, not just with shoes, but with clothing, especially with sportswear. And so, yeah, it's definitely a well-recognized brand. There's no denying that. And the history is robust in terms of the development of each product, the story behind each product. And people have a real attachment to Adidas shoes, Adidas clothes, especially, you know, in sports, especially in this country. And as you see on the screen here, this is the fairly recognizable design that you see on a lot of Adidas products, the three stripes. It's a legendary brand. And you see this type of design over and over again on the Adidas product. So it's very well-established. Certainly. And whether it's the footwear, the jackets, track suits, even the three stripes is throughout all of their products. Yes. It's very well-recognized. I think the company is some hundred years old out of Germany. And it has worldwide recognition. Right. And so diving into the dispute here and getting more into the, you know, kind of what's happening with Steve Madden and Adidas. In May of 2025, Steve Madden filed a lawsuit against Adidas in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. And this case centers around two of the Madden's sneakers, especially really keeping in mind that Steve Madden has different designs. But the specific ones at issue are the Vento and the Janos shoe, which feature two non-parallel, you know, borders or bands. And Adidas is claiming that these designs infringe upon its iconic, as we mentioned, three-stripe trademark. And it argues in this case that consumers might be confused into thinking that the Steve Madden shoes, the two that I just mentioned, are affiliated with or endorsed by Adidas in some way. But Steve Madden is pushing back. And the company is arguing that the use of these banded designs that they're using on their products is common in the fashion industry. And it's widely common. And that Adidas does not have the right to claim exclusive use over all striped products. That's how Steve Madden would sort of frame that argument. Certainly. And if you look at the screen here, we got the Steve Madden version of the shoe. And there's certainly there are some similarities, right? There's the you can see the stripes. But notably, there's only two of them. Right. And whether or not there's an exact match, what isn't necessarily what you need to establish, right? You need to establish whether or not a consumer is likely to be confused by the mark. Right. And here, Steve Madden's, you know, I think they're kind of trying to walk the line a little as close as possible to maybe be evocative of Adidas's brand, but distinct enough that they don't find themselves in legal hot water. That's yeah. And you mentioned legal hot water with respect to these three stripes. It wouldn't be Adidas's first rodeo with this. So Adidas has found itself in a legal battle over this design many times. In 2024, Adidas actually lost a lawsuit against a French fashion brand by the name of Isabel Marant and then another brand called Sandro. And these two brands were, you know, having similar arguments that we're seeing from Steve Madden. And the court ended up ruling that the stripes used by the two brands were not sufficient to establish infringement of Adidas's intellectual property rights in the three stripes. And the court also, you know, mentioned this positioning of the brands in the market and sort of what impact these cases have on the market. So it's really it's an interesting development that we're seeing with Steve Madden. It's definitely something that we've seen before with the three stripes in terms of the legal battles that have ensued because of people, you know, challenging that. So it's it's interesting to see this play out. Certainly. And I think we should kind of focus in now on what the actual like the catalyst of this current lawsuit, because it's interesting where most of the time trademark infringement suits are, you know, the owner of the mark sues an infringer. Right. Where right here, Steve Madden is they would they are the plaintiffs and they are suing for declaratory judgment, trying to have a court affirmatively state that they are not infringing. It's interesting. And they're doing that because they're saying that Adidas has had this history going back, I think, to 2002 of zealously enforcing their trademarks, which, of course, when you have a trademark, you have to enforce it. But you get to situations like this where Steve Madden is saying that Adidas has attempted to monopolize their mark and that they are chasing down, hounding and engaging in what Steve Madden says is unfair business practices with over policing. Yes. Steve Madden is definitely taking an aggressive approach with this case. I think it's it's interesting to to see them take that level of, you know, proactiveness in terms of protecting their products designs. And that that procedural aspect is particularly why I'm interested in following this case is because of the posture that Steve Madden is taking as plaintiff and the burdens that they will have to meet. It is going to be, like I said, interesting to see how that plays out. We'll see what the court says about this case. But you mentioned before that line between inspiration versus infringement. I think, you know, what does that mean for the fashion and footwear industry? Right. When that line is blurred, as brands continue to sort of push their creative boundaries, I think it's important for them to be in contact with their IP team and IP attorneys who can help them sort of navigate the difficult determination of where that line is drawn. And that line can become blurred very easily. We see it time and time again. But when it when it is with such a big brand like Adidas, the the risk is larger. And so it's important for businesses and brands and entrepreneurs to keep that in mind. And I think these legal battles they that we see unfolding are underscoring the importance of understanding what your IP rights are and what you need to do in order to protect them. Certainly. And I mean, as we tell pretty much all of our clients, no matter how good your case, your arguments are, you don't know the results until the jury makes their decision. So this is a time where possibly Steve Madden was told or Adidas was told, oh, yeah, we can certainly go forward with this. No, they're certainly infringing. But the only way we get a final answer is here in the courts. Right. Or negotiating an agreement with another with another brand, which, you know, that's that's an option for folks, too. But again, all the more reason to keep our eyes peeled to see how this unfolds. So this is a very interesting case with two very esteemed brands involved. We'll keep our eye on it and keep you posted. It's a lot of legal drama for some stripes, man. I like the dedication. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, I'm very curious about how this unfolds. I mean, this has been a longstanding thing with these brands. So very interesting nuance. I like the breakdown by these lawyers. In another life, I would have been a lawyer. But life said you don't have any money, so you can't go back to school. I was trying to do a Trump accent and then I had like an inner like cringe moment. And then I was trying to like play it off. But yeah, very interesting. I love this nuance. Very interesting. It's lawyers that do YouTube content, man. Barriancing Week Leonard LLP. There you go. Oh. Is a vintage car company treading on Ford's Bronco trademark? Oh. Uh-oh. I like this. I'm going to subscribe because I do want to learn more about that. I'll watch that later on. But I am going to move on because of time. Actually, I'm jumping on at 6. It's been a long day. I kind of low-key get really stressed when people I don't know come to my house. AT&T guy came over to my house and was like doing stuff. And I was like, dang, I didn't take my nap today. I did not take my nap today, guys. I love my naps. I function off of naps. Even if I'm not doing anything all day today, I need my naps. So I'm kind of really tired today. But hopefully you're enjoying the live stream. I do feel like I'm doing much better because of the internet. Hopefully my personality is coming across a bit better. For the past, like, six months, my live streams has just been me really stressed about the internet. Being like, dang, this sucks. Everything sucks. But, yeah, I'm so excited that the internet's working. It's been excellent. Except for one moment at 4.24 where there was an error. But I'll investigate why that happened. Maybe it was like the page, the article page, which is getting all the Wi-Fi power or something. But, yes, I am really, really excited to keep doing these live streams. Tuesdays and Thursdays, guys. Tuesdays and Thursdays. From 4 p.m. Central Time to 6.30 Central Time. Just put it in the background. Just have my voice infiltrate your personal lives. Oops. That sounds creepy. Never mind. But I actually do want to talk about some things before I jump off at 6. So, I was scrolling on social media and I saw the Hollywood Climate Summit. It sounds very fancy and kind of weird at the same time. I'm like, why is Hollywood having a climate summit? But I saw this on social media and I got really curious. And then I started watching their live streams. Because they live stream all their workshops. And I'm like, maybe y'all will be interested in listening about this or learning about this. Who knows? Y'all maybe like the climate. Maybe like the planet. Maybe care. Maybe don't like the fossil fuel industry. You know? Like, who knows? Maybe they actually want to learn. I'm sure you do. So, here is the live streams. If you just go to Hollywood Climate Summit. They have everything here. Have not subscribed. Let's just subscribe. Ta-da! But, yeah. They have a bunch of different workshops that they live stream. So, they talked about famous people and their perspective on climate justice. They talked about telling the story of climate resilient communities. They showed how there's movements on screen. Maybe that's like through ads or something. I don't know. I have no idea. How music mobilizes. What else? Oh my god. That looks delicious. That looks delicious. And messaging on the stand. Comedians, actors, and experts. Gaming takes on climate change. Maybe we'll watch a bit of that. Earth's epic comeback story. The new era begins behind the making of Jurassic World Rebirth. Don't know about that one. Okay. Hollywood Climate Summit 2025 Partner Spotlight. Gotta get them ads. Nice. Nice. Nice. Okay. Why are we consuming this? Because we like the food. Maybe. I don't know. I like- I want to watch this one. This one sounds interesting. And then Interdependence Day Reimagining Community Care After Disaster. Nice. Not sponsored. Nothing that comes out of my mouth is sponsored. I'm just simply curious. So let's watch a bit of this before we move on to how Greta is going to Gaza. Which I'm really worried about because she is- she is a one powerhouse of a 22 year old. I strive to be like Greta. But it does take a lot of bravery. So we're going to watch a bit of the gaming- which one was it? The Gaming Takes on Climate Change seminar or workshop, whatever it's called. And then we'll end off with Greta. I'm sure you've heard of it. But Greta is going to Palestine to raise awareness of the- of the issues in Gaza. So we'll watch a bit of this and then we'll watch a news clip on what Greta is doing and then kind of close off from there. So hopefully you've liked the live stream so far. I've loved it. So let's watch this. Let's watch. Okay. Blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. Blah blah. Blah blah. Blah blah blah. Blah blah. Okay. Hopefully I don't get copy striked. I just want to support. Okay. Let's see. Okay. Okay. Okay. Is it playing? I can't hear anything. And for us by the people who are responsible for it every single day. Inaction is an active choice. Like doing nothing is doing something. Taking action is an antidote to despair. We say I'm fighting for something I believe in. But the time is now. We have to step up. We can't sit this one out. We have to collaborate. We have to work together. It's time to get to know people who might feel like unlikely allies. Nature favors bravery always. So I want to encourage you to be brave. Trying to navigate how I can best use that platform to create real change. In the fight against climate crisis, our best weapon is our people. We have to be really intentional about the stories we tell. The worlds that we create on screen should be the worlds that we want to see off screen. It doesn't have to be a climate change story. Just weave it in naturally into every single story. The resistance movement has to be sexy. We have to figure out ways to find joy inside of struggle. We are able to link arms around these issues and work towards real solutions. They're going to take that positivity and they're going to take that hope. And they're going to share that with their friends and their family. But first, it's got to be entertaining. Entertainment shifts culture and culture shifts society. What kind of society do we want to live in in the future? The reality we think we live in is mostly just a story we tell ourselves. Because stories not only change the world, they shape it. Everybody is coming together and... We need you now. Hollywood is about imagination. It's not just ideas, it's also action. Everybody is in this together. Be optimistic. Let's go change the world, guys. Let's do it. This is proof of what can happen when we work together. Change is inevitable. We decide which changes we are going to be in. Me'iha ne'hinkam. Hello, relatives. Hello and greetings, esteemed guests and fellow environmentalists. It's truly an immense honor to stand before you today at the Hollywood Climate Summit. Where we've all come together with a shared vision for our Mother Earth. To save our planet and create a brighter future for the generations to come. We stand here today on Tovangal, the lands of the Tongva, the indigenous peoples. Here in this magical place called Hollywood, once stood our villages of Kauengna, Maungna and Yanga. It was on these very mountain ranges that the first barn was transformed into a movie studio, marking the beginning of a golden age of cinema that swept across the world for over a century. These movies depicted stories of romance, suspense and war, but also unfortunately included numerous derogatory stereotypes of the Native American or Indian. In the years since colonization and the prevailing influence of foreign culture, much of our own culture has been forgotten. Our language, songs, dances and traditional methods of hunting and harvesting these lands. That are so deeply imbued with the wisdom of our ancestors. But we remain working to recall our past and restore a time when we lived in harmony with the land we call home. You no doubt have heard that California has seen an unprecedented number of wildfires in the recent years. These wildfires are but one of the many catastrophic results of climate change. And can be mitigated by utilizing indigenous land stewardship and culture. Here, with the collaborative efforts of our communities and the governing agencies of the state, We have made substantial progress, but still require more support to truly make an impact. We have several indigenous led organizations that directly support our efforts towards redirecting climate change. You can learn about and directly donate to the Gabrileño Tongva Springs Foundation, The Tongva Tadahapahava Conservancy, A Hachiman Tongva Land Conservancy, or Sacred Places Institute for Indigenous Peoples. We ask that you help us in preserving our waters and returning the land to its rightful stewards. To nurture and cultivate the flora and fauna that we cherish so deeply. Please listen to our stories, prayers, and songs, and help us spread our message. Pay homage to the cultural bearers and caretakers of this land who pass down their wisdom and knowledge From generation to generation. When you look upon us, we hope that you recognize us as more than just natives. But as storytellers, singers, weavers, fire chiefs, paddlers, poets, filmmakers, painters, teachers, artists, and above all, we are the land. Hi everyone, how are you doing today? Woo! Day two! Let's go! My name is Allie Weinstein, my pronouns are she, her, and I am a co-founder of the Hollywood Climate Summit. So thank you, thanks, thank you for being here. I'm also the content lead of the Sustainable Entertainment Alliance, and I'm so excited to have you all here today. I would like to start off by saying I'd like to thank the Academy. It's very rare that you get the opportunity to say that in an appropriate situation. But they really are incredible. This is our third year partnering with them. And we've always appreciated their amazing support and the team that makes all this happen. So I would like to thank them. I would also love to thank our sponsors. That's great. That was our team that is our sponsors. That was hell. Thank you for spending the shopping visits with your team! So that we're our sponsors! That's great. Thank you for using your support! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It doesn't feel right to do nothing. It can break something in two seconds, or it can take forever to fix it. That's why we have to be careful on this earth. Stories about protecting what you love. Come with me. Come with me. Dubai Air is owned by a horrible company. One that has turned the southern coast of Nigeria into a hellish, fiery swamp. I can no longer wear that name on my chest. How will you be remembered? There's someone who fell back. Did you just proactively protect the environment? Maybe. Well, our theme is climate crisis meets extinction event. But in a fun way. Okay. Oh, it's breathtaking. Or a story of adventure. Wakanga will no longer watch from the shadows. We must find our way to look after one another as if we were one single tribe. Climate change is the story of our time. And it's being told right now. In small moments and blockbuster events that are connecting with audiences worldwide. Together we can change the world. So, want to tell a great story? Let's get it done. Go to climateonscreen.org where climate and great stories connect. I have seen that video genuinely 800 times. And I still get chills every time about what is possible with our storytelling. And someone who we partner a lot with on that storytelling is the NRDC. So, I'm very excited to introduce Katie Jacobs, who is the Director of Entertainment Partnerships, to introduce this next panel. Hello. Hello, everyone. And welcome to The Final Boss, Gaming Takes on Climate Change. I'm Katie Jacobs. I'm Katie Jacobs. I'm NRDC's Director of Entertainment Partnerships and the founder of the NRDC Climate Storytelling Fellowship. For more than 50 years, NRDC has fought to protect our climate and public lands, to save endangered species and their habitats, and to work toward justice and equity for all. We also develop strategic partnerships that leverage the power of entertainment and storytelling to shift the cultural narrative around the climate crisis and show the path toward a better future. We are thrilled to bring you this panel today, produced by the Hollywood Climate Summit and NRDC's Rewrite the Future program, which supports environmental representation in entertainment. For decades, gaming has been an influential medium in shaping our culture and how we interact with the world. With over 3 billion players worldwide, video games have massive potential for reaching and mobilizing the public to address real-world issues like climate change. In collaboration with the Playing for the Planet Alliance, a United Nations environment program facilitated initiative, NRDC is partnering with the Hollywood Climate Summit to develop a games and climate storytelling resource to support environmental themes in game design and narrative and to enrich players' experience with both the digital and natural worlds. So we're excited to dig into these topics today with our brilliant panelists, and we hope that this conversation and the report that we'll publish later this year can serve as an industry roadmap that game developers, studios, and creatives can follow to support culture shift work in the gaming industry that we and other organizations have been doing for several years in the film and television industry. With that, I'm thrilled to pass it over to our moderator, co-founder of the Hollywood Climate Summit, Heather Phipps, to kick off this conversation. Heather Phipps and Heather Phipps, Heather Phipps, Fan большойiec and Hone division management paris Criminal Pathspackingcios, Minister and Co-Founder of the Hollywood Climate Summit. Heather Phipps,africр Instructional panel Awesome. Hi, everyone. Thanks for coming out. I appreciate it. Good to see you. Let's give it up for our panelists. I can't wait to tell you about them. And I also want to express gratitude to our partners, the NRDC Rewrite the Future program. They do such incredible work. I'm so moved by that video as well, as Ali said. And I think that the lens of this conversation is really thinking about that opportunity for storytelling in the context of video games. And I will say that video games are so interesting because they have different modalities of storytelling in ways that film and television don't. So with our incredible panel today, I'm really looking forward to getting into that. First, I'd like to introduce you. So sitting to my left is Ashley Burch. If you don't know Ashley, you absolutely should. She's in, voices several of my favorite video game characters, I have to say personally. Ashley is a producer, writer, and series regular on Apple TV's Mythic Quest, as well as the co-creator and showrunner of its spin-off, Side Quest. She starred in last year's South by Southwest feature, We're All Gonna Die, which has secured distribution with Cinemark. And she previously starred in Disney television's The Ghost and Molly McGee. Ashley won an Emmy for writing an episode of Cartoon Network's Adventure Time, and is a BAFTA nominee for her lead performance in the video game version of Horizon Zero Dawn. And has voiced so many other incredible projects, like Borderlands 2, Fortnite. So truly a profound voice in the gaming space. Thank you for joining us, Ashley. Thanks for having me. Marina Passaros is a climate change planner, researcher, author, and creative technologist. Over the past 20 years, she has built environmental impact programs for government agencies, Fortune 500 companies, public schools, nonprofits, and everything in between. And I'm so excited to unpack the term creative technologist with you, Marina. Let's get it. And Carla Reyes is the founder and studio director at Anima Interactive. She's a Forbes 30 Under 30 fellow and a World Economic Forum Global Shaper with diverse experience in the media and gaming industries. She is also involved in environmental and social impact initiatives in the entertainment sector. She's a driving force at Code Coven, the first global games industry accelerator where she has raised substantial funding and established crucial partnerships. And she also partnered with us last year on the Hollywood Climate Summit for the Game Jam, which if you got to experience the prototypes playing last year and you saw the video at the beginning of the Solar Punk Game Jam that's happening now. So let's talk about that. But I want to open it up with a question for all of you to respond to, which is first, I'd love to just get your individual take on what's the scale and importance of engaging the gaming community? Who is drawn to games and why? And why do you think that that community could be uniquely activated around the issue of climate change? Who's first? I know. Sure, I'm happy to get started. Because I think that that's like part of the ethos of the studio that I'm trying to build as well. Because, you know, as Heather already mentioned, there are over three billion gamers globally. So video games are the largest entertainment medium in the world. And this is something that some people aren't necessarily aware of. And it's, you know, an immensely untapped tool, an opportunity for game developers, and not just game developers, but truly like anybody across any sector to be involved. And we'll dig into that probably a little bit more. But there really is this untapped opportunity to drive real world social change. So when you think about gamers, you know, there are people who are playing on their mobile phones, right? If you are opening up your New York Times games, like you are a gamer, right? And I think sometimes people don't necessarily identify with gamer, because there might be the stereotypical perception around like, oh, I only play Grand Theft Auto or something, right? So there are so many different definitions of what a gamer is or what a gamer looks like. And I think that's something that is an evolving conversation. But yeah, I think everybody is invited to the table when we're talking about that. And one of the things with games specifically that I really value is that the community and the audiences can actually participate in the development of games, right? Because they're not finite experiences. Often games are live or can make updates. And so game developers are really now focused on community building and listening to their audiences. And audiences can actually shape some of the content that is being created and updated in video games. So that's one of the more powerful pieces, I think. Yeah, I can pick up on that too. What I think is unique and what gets me really excited is when you, unlike sports or film, where you're primarily ingesting what's being delivered to you, with games, you are part of the, you're really driving what's happening in that game. You're in control of your experience. And you expect that when you play, you're going to be changing the outcomes. And you put your own experience and what you need to learn and what you need to vanquish, right, you know, it's right in there. It's what you're doing. It's why you play is to gain mastery, learn new skills, feel a sense of accomplishment. And that's exactly what we need with climate change. We need people to be at the center of their own experience, feeling like they're empowered to do things and understanding where their levers are, where they can actually drive change. That was what I was going to say. Nowhere near as articulately. Yeah, I think that is the sort of unique thing about, about games as a, as a medium, is that by virtue of the fact that it is a game, you are participating in the storytelling. And I think that has the possibility to have more impact or more lasting impact on the player than potentially a more, an active medium like TV or film, which is not to dismiss their impact. But there is a very specific experience when you're engaging with a game as a player that creates opportunities for conversations like this that would be, have a different impact than other forms of media. Absolutely. And Marina, you recently, well, not super recently, but your research is at the intersection of gaming and climate. You led a research initiative with Yale and Unity that examined the question of what gamers feel about climate change. Could you share some of the insights that you learned from that study? Yeah, and I realized that it would have been really relevant for me to mention to this group and in my bio that I was the head of climate and sustainability for Unity Technologies, the game engine, which is how I've gotten to some of this. So there we go. Doing it now. So the so this this project with Yale came out of my own reality as a gamer where I would play and I feel like so many people have this perception of gamers that it's like some like incel teenage boy like slumped over his console, like playing a first person shooter for days on end, which is definitely part of the beautiful giant tent of gaming for sure. But it's not all of it. And so I thought, how do we do some myth busting around this? So we partnered with the Yale's Center for Climate Change Communications and did a gen pop survey. So all of you know, the general US population and looked at what the differences were between people who identified as gamers and those who did not. And there was a bunch of really interesting results that came out of that, most of which I can't remember right now. So which is why I also have a little piece of paper with me. I wanted to pull out three of them because I think it's relevant for you folks here. And the first one is that players, people who identified as game players versus gen pop felt like they were more worried about climate change. They were more interested in getting information about climate change and they were sort of more educated about it. The second thing that was a difference that I thought was really exciting was that they were more hopeful. And this I'm still kind of trying to figure out why that is. But we asked gamers or we asked everyone in the survey, you know, do you think that we will be able to solve this in your lifetime? What are going to be solutions? And gamers were actually more hopeful. I kind of think that it might be because of what we mentioned. We all talked about gamers being like having a real sense of agency over a large part of their experience, which is when they play. And then the third thing that was really exciting to me was that gamers also showed more willingness to act. So we asked everyone a whole bunch of questions. Would you be willing to, you know, donate money, spend time doing something, change your behavior, change your consumerism, take direct action? And gamers were more likely to say that they would be willing to do that. You know, obviously the next level of study is to go back and see whether or not they actually do that. But at least gamers felt like they would be more into doing that. So and actually speaking of that, we are I just talked to our collaborators at Yale the other day and we're looking to do a next next iteration of this research. And I would like to actually go back and see whether or not people's anticipated what they think they'll do matches what they actually do. So come chat with me sometime about that because I'm very interested in it. And I think I guess since I have the mic, I'll just keep going for a minute. I think the thing that is really relevant to folks here is, you know, like that audience or those those folks are already like primed. They're interested in content. And so it's not we don't have to like tiptoe around and like sideways it in. We can just like get out there and tell the stories and show the futures that we want and all the things that the awesome video expressed more awesomely. And Carolyn and I were like, oh, my God, they have to stop playing this video. It's all the things we wanted to say. But those features of, you know, hope and and positive stories are something that I think that all of you could be able to provide. Thank you for saying that. It's so important for people to know we say audiences, but gamers, audiences, players are hungry for this. They're ready and it will be well received. It's not something that we have to tiptoe around, as you said, or break the ice. And I think there are some incredible examples we'll get into that have already done that. All righty. Very interesting for sure to listen. I will listen to the rest of this when I have some downtime. But just because I'm coming to a close with this live stream, it is coming to be 630 right now. It's going to be 630 right now. I'm going to move on to Greta Thunberg on Gaza. I just want to say before I move on, though, that I have always wanted to be a gamer. But I've always been very anxious about time, about expectations, about reaching my goals, about life in general. I've always been someone that's prone to want to have success, to have abilities, to have money, to have this American dream. And it's consumed me, consumed me my entire life to the point where I never felt like I could relax and, like, play a game. When I was a kid, I didn't play games. When I was a teen, I didn't play games. When I was an adult now, I have never played games. I've never allowed myself to have fun. So one of the things that I told myself is that, yes, you can continue to work. You can continue to apply to jobs and go to interviews, do content, do these live streams, and still play games. So I'm going to be gaming Wednesdays and Sundays. I am someone that really wants to be consistent on live streaming, on content creation, on the things that I care about. So hopefully you tune in and watch me play games if that's of interest. I don't really know why people watch others play games, but I'm just going to be online. So if you want to jump on, that will be happening during the night. It's like 6.30, 7.30 Central Time. And just let myself have some fun. I think it's important to balance out the seriousness and chaos and the overwhelm that we can feel in the midst of all the problems. Self-care is definitely needed. So I've always been someone that's highly online. So if I can just convert my time online to something that is fun and I can have agency over, I think gaming is the answer for me. So I really like Sailor Moon. I like the Brad's games, like the Y2K old games. Nothing too serious. What else have I been looking into? Winx, Sailor Moon I've mentioned. Dress and Press. I want to play that game. And then there's another one. Nikki. Nikki something. It's like a very immersive game that I see everyone playing. What's it called? Nikki game. Infinity Nikki. That's what I've been seeing. It has a lot of like fashion bits here and there. You can dress her up. And it's very, very core. So I like that. Probably going to buy that game soon. And yeah, that's kind of what I'm up to for hobbies. I'll be live streaming my first gaming session this Sunday. Hopefully I have the PC up and running by that time and I know what I'm doing and I have the games on there. But if I don't figure it out by Sunday, I'll for sure do it by this upcoming Wednesday. For sure. But to move on, I will show y'all now what is happening with Greta. I'm sure you guys have heard what's happening. But I just want to watch this video. Or some of the video. And then jump off. Just watch this one. There's so many tabs open. What the heck? Okay, this, this. Done with that. And go here. Okay. The result? Children dying of hunger and more than 90% of the population... Let me start it over. In the blue expanse of the Mediterranean, a ship named Madeline sails towards Gaza. It carries no weapons, only food, medicine and defiance. Launched by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, Madeline is headed for a land under siege... ...as Israel continues to enforce a near-total blockade on aid to Gaza. The result? Children dying of hunger and more than 90% of the population facing catastrophic food shortages. The ship is named after Gaza's most recognized fisherwoman. A symbol of survival. A tribute to resistance. Madeline is charting a journey of 2,000 kilometers. Every one of them shadowed by risk. And no matter how dangerous this mission is, it is so near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world... ...in the face of a live streamed genocide. On board are activists including Greta Thunberg and Yasemin Arjar. A suicide mission. As they sail past the coast of Crete, we connect with them. They know they may be intercepted, diverted or detained at any moment. But still, they go. From the Mediterranean Sea, Greta Thunberg and Yasemin Arjar talk to Al Jazeera. Greta Thunberg, thank you so much for talking to Al Jazeera. I think anyone watching the carnage in Gaza can probably understand your motivation for wanting to help a people that UN officials say... ...Israel is exposing to forced starvation. But why did you feel it was vital for you, not only to support the Madeline, but to be on board it? It's just, if you have any sense of humanity left, then there is no option but to stand with Palestine and to do everything you can. And for some reason, I have a platform that I can use. And if my presence on this boat can contribute in any way to showing solidarity with Palestinians, then I will do that. Are you hopeful that the presence of prominent figures like yourself, like the Irish actor Liam Cunningham, this time on this boat... ...might help increase the Madelines' chances of actually reaching Gaza? That we don't know. But what we do know is that I and the others on board will continue doing everything we can, both in the short term and in the long term... ...to fight for justice and to demand an end to Israel's war crimes. Given what happened to previous boats, do you in your heart feel you really will make it to Gaza? What are the chances, do you feel? The uncertainties are very big, of course, and we have made many risk assessments trying to judge the situation. And we are preparing for different scenarios to respond in a non-violent way to maximize our safety. But we are aiming to sail to Gaza. That is what we do know at this point. What will it mean for the world if this boat is either attacked by drones, as the conscience was, or raided by Israeli commandos, as the Mavi-Marmara was? Yeah, we have made it very clear from the beginning that we are 12 peaceful volunteers who are not carrying weapons. We are carrying humanitarian aid. We will not be responding in any violent way. We are sailing on international waters, which is our right to do. So, again, if someone, IOF or allies with Israel, decides to attack us, then it is just another example of the disrespect of international law and human rights. Will you still consider this mission a success, even if you don't make it to Gaza? So, the point, at least, behind my participation here personally is that I feel like no matter what odds we are facing, we have to keep trying. And whatever happens, we will be able to see that we tried our best. We tried every method we had at hand. And we will continue to do so in whatever shape or form, whether we make it to Gaza and we'll be able to distribute the humanitarian aid or if we are stopped on the way. But we must also remember that we do not only need humanitarian aid to come into Gaza. We do not only need a ceasefire, we need an end to the occupation. I'm not sure how closely you're able to follow social media these days, but US Senator, not surprising, but US Senator Lindsey Graham posted on X a comment, which has been widely seen as a threat against you and the aid mission, saying, hope Greta and her friends can swim. Does it shock you that this sort of devaluation of your life and the lives of the people with you on that boat can come from a senior figure of the US government, of the Congress? Unfortunately, it does not surprise me. The reason why we have ended up in the situation we are is because of the systematic dehumanization of of Palestine and demonization of everyone who expressed solidarity. So that does not surprise me at all, unfortunately, it does say a lot about their approaches that they were the these elected officials who are complicit in genocide, spend their time mocking people who are at least trying to do something rather than ending their complicity, says everything you need to know about them. What do you say back to him, Greta? I don't need to me. It's not worth my time responding to that. There are so many, so many similar comments every day. And it's just why should I? Why should I care? How confident are you as an EU citizen that should this boat come under attack, that the EU that EU navies will be there to assist you, given what happened to the previous ship, the conscience? Yeah. Unfortunately, not too confident. What does bringing aid to Gaza mean for addressing the needs of people there whom dozens of UN special rapporteurs and experts, international human rights groups say, are facing a genocide? Yeah, of course, it is very, very clear that humanitarian aid desperately need to come into Gaza and that the blockade has to end. But as I said earlier, we do not only need short term humanitarian aid, we need a long term end to the occupation, a permanent ceasefire and justice and freedom for all Palestinians. So the humanitarian aid is, of course, a symbolic amount, as we cannot fit too much on this boat. But it is also an attempt to once again try to break the siege and open up the humanitarian corridor. And of course, a symbolic act of solidarity with Palestinians. We know the last boat, the conscience came under a drone attack. The Marvive Marmara was raided by Israeli commandos, a raid that killed 10 people. Is any part of you afraid, Greta? What I'm afraid of is the deadly silence of the world and the passivity that so many people are showing right now when they know very much what is going on, that they do not put pressure on their own governments, even though that they know that they are very much complicit. That is what scares me the most. You're very well known for your efforts to urge the world to protect the environment. Are you on the mandoline today as a climate activist or simply as a human being who cares about the lives of others? I would say the latter. Stepping up and showing solidarity with Palestine is something that everyone must do, no matter your background, no matter where you are from. And again, I'm a climate justice activist because I care about justice because I care about human and planetary wellbeing. It should be self-evident why we should all act in all our power to stand in some day with Palestine. The question should not be why do you care about Palestine? The question should be why? Why on earth are you not caring? Why are you not outraged? So clearly you see a link between environmental activism and the mission that you're on, given that environmental and climate change often harms vulnerable communities. And what we see in Gaza is a very vulnerable community being harmed. Yeah, of course. There are many direct links links that show how ecocide and environmental destruction is a systematic method of war and to use to oppress people. And so, but also, again, it should be much simpler than that. It should just be if you care about humans, if you care about justice, then you should care both about climate justice and the justice of Palestine. And the final question, Greta. We know that the Madeleine has been facing a lot of hurdles and challenges. We know it's been tracked by drones. What do you feel? How do you feel about the position that European governments have taken, Western governments, the US has taken towards this aid mission? Have they done their moral and legal responsibility in your eyes? Nowhere near enough. But also, we must remember that this mission is not about us. This mission is not about Madeleine and the passengers on board, the crew, volunteers on board. This mission is about Palestine and the genocide and the occupation that is ongoing. And in that question, it is shameful every day how the world keeps showing its betrayal towards Palestinians. If you do make it to Gaza, what do you plan to do? Have you thought about that scenario as unlikely as it may seem to many people? Yeah, then we will distribute humanitarian aid. That is the main goal. Okay, thank you very much, Greta Thunberg, for talking to Al Jazeera. Thank you. Yasemin Ajar. It is 6.32 PM Central Time. Highly recommend following along with Freedom Flutia. To stay updated, I wish everyone safety and a good journey towards Palestine. It is definitely not going to be easy. But yeah, hopefully you liked the livestream. There is a lot going on. There is a lot going on. But, um... We carry on. We keep moving. We keep hoping and we keep taking action. Hopefully you learned something. Hopefully we keep moving forward. And I will see you Sunday for some gaming. And then more news on Tuesday. But yeah, hoping that you have a lovely, lovely Thursday and a lovely, lovely week. It is Friday. It is tomorrow. But until then, I will see you in the next livestream. Peace and love. Ellie. Bye. Lori. Bryce. Thanks for having fun, stay here. I cannot get into the pikini give it aск at me. Also give it a sera from next time. Let's see if we can just begin reading thisand wait. Let's see if we нач because of that and will be helpful in the evening. I will see you next down. Bye. Bye. Bye. Prong.
