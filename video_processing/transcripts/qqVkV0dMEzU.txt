Howto & Style
 There's a lot of reasons I started farming. Primarily I didn't want to be stuck in an office, but farming is also a way to address a lot of different things that I find important like environmental sustainability, social equality, all those things and still do it in a way that's really constructive and productive. My name is Russell Hondard from King of Crops and I'm a proud supplier of peach dish.
