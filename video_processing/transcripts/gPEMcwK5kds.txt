 Hello, I'm Wendy Seal. We're here in North East Scotland, just outside Aberdeen at Vital Veg, which is a market gardening business that I've owned and run for 12 years. We employ five people and then additional casual labour during the summer. We've got 10 acres of vegetables and it's surrounded by a bigger farm. The whole farm is 130 acres. We have quite a lot of trees on the farm. There's a 50-acre block of mixed native woodland, which is 12 or 13 years old now, and various hedges that we've planted over the years, including a number of mixed hedges in the vegetable field and around the vegetable field to provide protection. There's lots of reasons for having trees on the farm, partly because I love trees. They're fantastic. It's a real privilege, actually, to be able to plant trees, to have enough space to plant them. But besides the fact that they're wonderful and beautiful and valuable things in their own right, the trees provide a really useful service for us on the farm. One of the main motivations for planting trees for the vegetables is shelter. Increasingly, we're getting stronger and stronger winds coming from, particularly from the west. It's very hard on the young vegetable plants. We plant our vegetables out as transplants, a lot of them, and strong winds can really quickly dry them out before they've had a chance to get rooted into the soil, and it can decrease the establishment quite significantly. So planting hedges in the fields in strategic points to break up the wind really will help improve the establishment of the vegetables. It also provides a habitat, hopefully, for beneficial organisms, pollinators and parasitic wasps and birds, who will hopefully reduce the number of pests amongst the vegetables. So shelter, a habitat for beneficials, and the beauty of the trees are key motivations. The hedges that we've planted in amongst the vegetables are mixed hedges. They're mostly hawthorn, which is a really good wind-resistant, tough hedging plant. But the hawthorn is interspersed with other species as well. And amongst those we've put some trees that could provide an income. Because we're in the northeast of Scotland, we have to be aware of the weather conditions here, so we can't plant walnuts or even apple trees, really, because of late frosts. So the trees we've got here that could provide a crop for us are rowan, for rowan berry jelly, and elder, for elderflowers and elderberries. We also have crabapple, for crabapple jelly. So those are the three key cropping species that we have interspersed in the hedges. Establishing the hedges, the way we did that, we ploughed a strip of ground into one of the... It's a five year rotation in the vegetable field. So two years out of every five, the ground is in what's called a lay, a mixture of grass and clover. So in that period we then ploughed a strip through the lay, in the place where we wanted to put the hedge, and then planted the young hedge plants into that strip. Because we have a deer and rabbit fence around the whole field, we didn't need to use any tubes to protect the trees from that. The first two years after planting we kept the hedges weeded, and at the end of the second year going into the third year we actually cut the hedge down quite low, about a foot high, to try and make the hedge denser and to encourage branching. So it's a double hedge, they're all double hedges, so two rows of plants about a foot or 18 inches apart, they're planted in a staggered pattern to get a nice thick, hopefully windproof hedge. But there are some potential downsides, that the hedges do take up space, not just for the hedge itself, but we have an issue here with couch grass, which has invaded where the hedges are planted. And it will creep out into the fields, especially during the time in which we've got lay down, and the ground isn't cultivated. So what we have to do in the places where the couch grass has become worst, is to keep a strip fallow beside the hedge to prevent couch grass invading into the field. The hedges and the vegetable field, and also a windbreak, which we've put to the west of the vegetable field, are here courtesy of the Woodland Trust. The Woodland Trust have a project specifically for putting trees on organic farms. It's called the Purr Project, P-U-R. The Woodland Trust were absolutely fantastic actually, helping us with this project. They provided money for the trees and for fencing. And they also helped us with the choice of species. We had a local advisor here who helped us with that. And also with the design. So the design of the windbreak. We've got a 300 metre long windbreak. And the Woodland Trust advisor helped us select the species and the way in which they're planted in the windbreak, to get the maximum benefit of that. The hedges are spaced in the field according to our cropping rotation. So as I mentioned earlier, we've got a five year cropping rotation. So basically the vegetable field is divided into five blocks. And each of those is defined now by one of these wonderful hedges. normalizedık decimals ettiko sulla perm skillsislauf.
