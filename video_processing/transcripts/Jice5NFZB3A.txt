И это всегда был, знаешь, я мечтал, чтобы начать свою собственную бутылку. И тогда два года назад, два и половина года назад, я попросил на уровень, и мы начали «Френдли Фарма Бутылку». И это абсолютно замечательно. Мой мужик делает все администрации, я блогман. Я надеюсь, что сыграла футболь. И debt Быстро, что-то было предsehen срешении, я нана срешив community.

I certainly saw hell of a change in my soil after going with the medics. It's amazing how much life returned to the soil. And also with this change that we made, we went into, we started doing, we got planters where we use the shank. So we try and do minimum disturbance of the soil to try and keep as much moisture as well when we are doing the wheat year. Like I said, the one year is wheat, the next year we have medics, the next year we have wheat again. And I also do other rotation crops as well. I use oats, I do a lot of oats. And some oats we do for oat hay. The other oats, you know, at the moment I'm actually busy harvesting oats for seed, you know, for the car perangia. And getting a very good yield. But it's important to... Gluten in current, so there are many wheat kernels in your oats. So it's very important, that's why I'm doing oats at the moment. Also, we have now the last four years, we've started with regenerative farming. Where we take our swill and we started doing cover crops. You know, obviously, you know, my medics is of such nice quality and it grows, you know, in abundance, you know, a hell of a nicely. So that to me is also a cover crop because in the summer, when the medics goes down, it goes and lies down, my soil is basically covered, you know. And we do, we also bring in other cover crops. We do a little bit of oats. We do a little bit of oats. We use a little bit of oats. And then we sow it into the... ...of the medics and oats. So that the medics can also come through and, you know, leave its burrs and everything. And I find it absolutely amazing. It was incredible. You see, it's what started in its own life. How the earthworms came in and started burrowing. And I always say to the people, whenever I walk there, I always say, look at this, look at this earthworm life. Because those are my plows. Those are my... It's what is, you know, doing the thing. And I think I personally, that's the way I've gone. And I'm on a rate of 38 kilograms of nitrogen. There are people coming right next to me on the old mono culture. Are going in at about 110 kilograms of nitrogen on their wheat loads, you know. So, I mean, that sum is very easy to make, you know. You can just see what, you know, what lies in it. And I've, in fact, just finished harvesting my wheat for this year. And it was an amazing crop. I must say, though, that for the last six years, we've really had tough times. So we've had droughts. Last year wasn't too bad. But we had a bit of frost, you know, during the flowering season. But last six years was really, it was tough. But this year was amazing. And I'm sorry. That's great. I'm happy for you. You must stop me if I talk too much. No, it's okay. I mean, we want information, right? And my question then is, you know, it sounds like you've, you know, dabbled a bit in a number of different crops, you know, for the purpose of crop rotation. And when you're going through these processes as a farmer, you know, who are the people that you'd sit down and talk to, to assist you to say, like, who made you say, now you need the specific crop to rotate with wheat, for example, sorry. And how did you come about doing that research, you know? So just in case maybe people in the audience are thinking, yes, I want to do crop rotation, but I don't know what to rotate my crops with. So how do you find a good companionship with the kind of crops that you're farming, which first of all was wheat, so that you could, you know, rotate and obviously grow your enterprise. So at what point did you make that decision? And who are the type of people did you liaise with to maybe see if this idea would work or not? Yeah. Yeah. Going here in the Western Cape, you know, I always say in the area that you are farming, you know, it's very important. What do they do? There is a success line. And the agricultural, the Western Cape Agricultural Union, that they have a very close to us, about 30, 40 kilometers away. They've got a farm there where from Elsenburg, they do a whole lot of trials, you know, doing basically canola, doing lupin, doing oats, doing the medics. Different variety of medics. And then the rotational crop. And then you have companies like Agricol and you have Barenburg, you know, that come and they do it on this farm that is owned by the Western Cape Agriculture from Elsenburg. And they all do their little trials there and all different types of trials, you know. And then what they also do is, and it's called a Skogdag. It's normally in September, beginning of September, they have a farmer's day. Everybody's interested, comes along and we have a look. What are the varieties that are doing good? What, you know, what should you do next year for your area? Which is, which to me, that's basically where you learn a lot of things, you know. Because you can see what happens. And I think that's the important thing about it. Also, I have a company that I do, you know, the guy helps me with my fertilizer and, you know, what to do and so on. I know I'm glad to say that we can minimize our risk, you know. And I think that's the biggest thing of all. You must minimize your risk by going in with the least inset, but the best outset, you know, and the best quality. And I think that is very important. And quite honest with you, I think there's a little bit of a, you know, if you see the quality of wheat that we get from our medic system, you know, and we specifically, I also do my fertilizer. And I try and do biological farming with my fertilizer where I use a chicken. And I get my, you know, amounts of phosphorus amount of potash and then, of course, nitrogen. And it's all in a little fertilizer, little pull, little chicken, you know, manure pull. They do it in a pull form and then we sow. But to me, the big disappointment is that... As a farmer, I don't get it because the quality of wheat that is doing biological farming. You know, from the malaria. I think that's... But I think it's something that's going to happen soon. You know, when people are now shouting more for the quality of wheat that they get as to other wheat that has, for instance, you know, had a lot of nitrogen and so on. I mean, it's just a better quality, you know. Yeah. Yeah. So hopefully that's... And also, and also we, you know, we, we, we in dire straits for next year, you know, with the first up so unbelievably high. So fortunately, you know, I'm on my system of farming where I go with the low insects and I just bring my wrist up. And that I do my friends, this friend of mine who, you know, who does my fertilizer. And then of course, you know, we use pesticides. We have to. And then I try and lay away from things like randa. I try. I don't always. But I try my best, you know, to, to, to sort of keep that out of my system. Yeah. Yeah. You know, typically traditional farming is... Sorry to interject there. Typically traditional farming is, you know, heavily reliant on pesticides and chemicals and fertilizers. And it sounds like you've obviously adopted like a biological approach, as you've said. Do you think that you've seen a significant amount of operational reduction in terms of the expenses that you would have ordinarily paid? For when, if you had gone, you know, the traditional farming methods, now that you've adopted a more of a regenerative farming or biological approach, as you've put it. So do you think that with going with a different approach, maybe deviating slightly from traditional farming methods to rather care more for your soil? Have you seen a change in your business operational expenses where they have reduced perhaps? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean, without a doubt. I mean, my diesel, my, you know, my fuel account, I think has been halved from what it used to be, you know. And my fertilizer, I mean, they used to put in here with, you know, 30 tons, you know, full of fertilizer. I have one truck of 30, 30 tons that comes in and does my, and, and, and, and it's amazing. You know, it's, you know, from, from those years to now, I would say, I think there was a reduction of about close onto 40% in usage of, of, of fuel and fertilizer. Definitely. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think from your, from your experience causes the shift for farmers to think slightly differently from traditional farming practices? Is it things that happen in the economy or, you know, like high fuel prices or high input cost prices? Or is it because maybe over the years farmers are starting to become thinking, yes, definitely much more long-term to say, how do I preserve my soil? And therefore, how do I find companion plants to, to ensure that my soil, you know, can last generations to come? If I'm still, you know, producing in this one specific farm or piece of land. So what do you think causes the farmers to make that shift? You know, to, to, to, to, to, to focus a lot more on the production practices? Is it the economy? Is it the push from high input costs? Or is it just, do you think that farmers are becoming slightly more conservative rather with regards to the environment, et cetera? And, you know, people are starting to just make certain changes. Yeah. Raleigh, I'm, I think the, the thing that is really hitting home now is, is, is, is the weather, you know? Yeah. It's been amazing the last five, six years to see what global warming and, and I believe in global warming. I have experienced it myself. Yeah. Yeah. We, we, we have a September month. It's very, very important. That's when just after the weeks fly, it's a little, it's a little gray, you know, must get, it was set now. And, and we just haven't had September months. We, we just don't have rain in September again, you know, lately. And, and I put it down to global warming and global warming has made it that you must absolutely at all costs. You must try and preserve as much moisture in the ground as possible. That means you don't open, you don't open it up. You must serve your will as well as possible. And I think that together with the cost of, of insect costs and everything, as really, I think, um, for me, that was my game changer. Because I, I just, I just thought to myself, I just thought my own eyes that if I wasn't going to make the change, I wasn't going to be on the farm for very long. So that is what I did. And I go with the lowest insets as, as possible. And, and not trying to make a profit margin. I mean, at the end of the day, that is what it's about, you know, making a profit. And, um, yeah, and that's what's changed. And incidentally, you know, it really changed my, my mind as well. I can remember, um, you know, when you, when you drive a lot of fence, you don't, on the fence, there's, there's like a, you know, there's like a half a meter this side, half a meter that side that you, you never work there. And everything that grows on next to the fence, you know, it's always looks lush. And if there's a little weak kernel that falls there or a medic, it grows with so much power. And why? It never gets disturbed. You understand? And that is why I say, I try and just. So. As little as possible. I don't burn my lands. A lot of people still around here. They burn the stubble because they're doing the murder culture. Culture. And. It's. The lines for little, the rotting. It's. To take place. That's why they got to put on like close to a hundred kilograms of nitrogen. Whereas I go, I don't burn it at all. I don't disturb it because. My material must go into my swell. And that's the only way that you're going to get your carbon. And. When content in your swell goes up. Then the penetration of water is so much better for the swell. And that's what. What. What set me. Go. I think all those things to be. You know. Yeah. Yeah. My last question for you this evening. Lofi is. You know. You've mentioned monoculture, right? And. For anybody listening and thinking. Wow. There's monoculture. And there's crop rotation. And you're farming. Weed. You're farming medics. You're farming something else. In between that. All for the purpose of crop rotation. Is it fair to say that the crop rotation practices and methods. Become slightly more expensive as opposed to monoculture. Because in monoculture, you're controlling expenses. You know. Year after year. You're farming a single crop. Where you can control your expenses. Control your input costs. Whereas crop rotation. Each crop requires something different. And it could be different fertilizers, etc. So. Is it true maybe to. To think that maybe crop rotation. Will be slightly more expensive than monoculture. Or does it not make a difference at all? No. No. Not at all. Especially. What I'm doing with my medics. You know. My clovers. I started. Over the year. I've never. The. The, of my lands. Because. Because. I let the clover develop the first year. The second year it gets wheat. The third year when it's clover again. Продноя хочется переод favors я сняла в центра, а favorites41см. Похоже невероятно выходят черезисти и из Уильive Aaşиваса. expensive to start off with one so if you look after your your phosphate son which which which you correct in the in the year of the wheat you know where you put your phosphates down and so on and and and if your ph is fine then it's a once-off thing and it's just the every second year you have this most amazing medics you know that you can either harvest or you can use it for for your animals to graze on it's oats to me is is also a very very nice rotation crop let's have an amazing root system which i think it's it's it's conducive to i think magnesium gets you know put into the swell which takes a lot of the i don't know what the english word is for all yeah normally you know is amazing it's you know it's just so it's nice it's a better key and disease this crops which is amazing i i like to do the the japanese radish it's it's like a whole radish a huge and it breaks up your soil you know so so if you have compact soil and so on and you do the radish it breaks the soil it is it it's it's like a it's like a twine you know that you when you when you plant it's it it sort of does the same thing it loosens up your swell that's also very nice and then lupins i i i forgot to tell you about lupins lupins also it's got a nice pen root so it also penetrates that soil you know so it loosens the soil and it's also a nitrogen fixing you know which you're following here you know you can cut back on your nitrogen application to your wheat and uh yeah that's it and what is it what is amazing is oh yeah i wish i with this one more thing i wish you could see this the sheep on the medic land it's amazing how the man nice grass that they have on their legs nice thick bone structure and everything it's just to me it's the best thing of the sliced bread and and really i you know i enjoy it connections are stable off because then you know your livestock can definitely benefit from it and your butchery can also benefit from it and that um i like the fact that at every process you keep adding certain value into your production and into your agribusiness but thank you so much for your time this evening luffy um it was great chatting to you and i just want to say to the audience just uh you know uh apologies for the um this connection here and there when you was when when luffy was speaking you know connections not always the greatest at farms but yeah uh luffy thank you for obviously bringing that wisdom and various crop um advices in terms of rotation and different um crops that one could use obviously um to obviously improve the the the the texture of the soil to prove the composition of the soil nitrogen etc so yeah thank you for coming on to the show this evening thank you for coming on to the show and all the best uh for your farming as well i hope all goes well there and i hope i hope the rain comes hey we're all over yeah okay yes thank you so much hey okay thank you you need the rain if you missed this conversation we're just speaking to luffy smiths from the friendly farmer butchery um he's a farmer in the western cape and we're speaking about traditional farming methods that one can adopt for the purpose of crop rotation and luffy informed us that he's a weed farmer but also has um you know dabbled a bit in medics in clover and also gave us some gems about you know planting radishes to improve your soil and what it is it does to your soil um from farming and all these have obviously created a great impact in his business because he has now reduced his input costs um and also we all i think just trying to win it where climate change is where climate change is concerned as farmers so if you miss this conversation you can catch it on the private property youtube channel under the farming podcast playlist if you have any questions please feel free to drop them into the comment section and we'll answer them to the best of our abilities as well um and yeah keep supporting the podcast thank you so much for tuning in this evening i will catch you on thursday at eight o'clock take care time he's i Субтитры подогнал «Симон» Субтитры подогнал «Симон» Субтитры подогнал «Симон» Субтитры подогнал «Симон» Субтитры подогнал «Симон» Субтитры подогнал «Симон» Субтитры подогнал «Симон» Субтитры подогнал «Симон» Субтитры подогнал «Симон» Субтитры подогнал «Симон» Субтитры подогнал «Симон» Субтитры подогнал «Симон» Субтитры подогнал «Симон»
