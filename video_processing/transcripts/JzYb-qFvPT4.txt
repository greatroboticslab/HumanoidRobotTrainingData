 Eric Ruderskold Sure, I'm Eric Ruderskold with Johnson Tractor, been with Johnson Tractor for 19 years. Started our precision farming department and have grown it to now two and a half people. We've got two full-time guys and one intern that do our precision farming. And with me today is Adam Hinkle, our precision farming specialist at Rochelle. We've been kind of a separate department for about three years now. It's where we've taken it from being somebody that can handle it part-time to needing a full-time person and now at least two full-time people. It's a whole separate division or a whole separate department. But eventually it'll become more mainstream as it comes new on the equipment. You know, technicians are involved more and more just like an option on a tractor was a couple years ago. Now it's part of the equipment. So they'll be involved in setting it up, fixing it, just like they would another piece of the tractor. More or less getting up to date with the new equipment, how to operate it, run it, how everything ties together. I mean the monitors now, they can control the tractor themselves. So it's a matter of knowing how each monitor works with the various pieces of the equipment, how we can tie that together and make it work for the farmer. We've got some customers that grow some specialty crops, some seed corn. And with the price of seed corn for that specialty stuff, being expensive as it is, they want some shutoff control so they're not overlapping, wasting seed and inputs. So we've got several customers that do that kind of stuff that we've helped them out with that kind of stuff. Yeah, I mean that does go along well with growing seed corn. You need to build a row shutoffs where maybe you're not planting a bull row. With the new technologies, it makes it a lot simpler to go out there, fill your hoppers, and just go plant and not have to be getting out all the time, turn rows on and off. It's a lot simpler. Yep.
