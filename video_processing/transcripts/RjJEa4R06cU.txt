 Yesterday we went on a hike. On our hike we found some palmito or heart of palm. This is a vegetable which goes bad very quickly. To eat it many people boil it. This vegetable contains 17 different amino acids including the nine essential amino acids which your body cannot produce on its own. It's low in fat and sugar high in fiber and has several healthy vitamins and minerals. The most common mineral found in heart of palm is potassium. There are also an excellent source of protein which is very uncommon in vegetables.
