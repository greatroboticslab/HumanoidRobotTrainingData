 Seaweed is something you might try to avoid at the beach, but a team of researchers from the Sunshine Coast thinks it could be Queensland's next big industry. A trial of seaweed farming off the southeast Queensland coast is showing promising results. In Moreton Bay, an oyster farm is trying something new. Seaweed. In total we farmed about 125 kilograms of seaweed or around 10,000 sushi rolls worth. Small plants are put into nets and attached to oyster lines, growing into a floating forest of seaweed sausages. In a joint project between the University of the Sunshine Coast and water provider Urban Utilities. It's quite tough to grow oysters, it takes around about three years and with climate change and increasing water temperatures there's a lot more risk of operation around disease. So they were really keen to see if they could diversify into other products. It could be Queensland's next big industry, used for more than just sushi. We know that seaweed can be fed to cattle, there's even people exploring its use in sustainable packaging, so plastics. 30 million tonnes of seaweed is produced worldwide each year and forecasts show Australia has the potential for a billion dollar industry within the next two decades. The two year trial has had environmental benefits too. For every tonne of wet seaweed that we're pulling from the bay, we're pulling out about one and a half kilos of nitrogen as well. It remains to be seen whether large scale seaweed farming would be commercially viable in Moreton Bay, but from little things, big things grow. Elizabeth Cramsey, ABC News.
