 Water scarcity will be a global issue of critical importance in the 21st century. And ensuring safe drinking water and water for farming will be an enormous challenge. Low and irregular rainfall patterns are not the only reasons for drought. Irresponsible and unplanned development, environmental damage are worsening the problem. Climate change is causing weather patterns to shift, leading to unseasonal rains, hailstorms, dust storms, excessive rainfall, rising temperatures, and frequent droughts. Available water resources are drying up or disappearing at an alarming rate even in regions that receive nearly 200 mm of rainfall. Take Maharashtra as an example. 11% of the cultivable land receives 50% of the available water. Out of 225 lakh hectares of arable land in the state, 40% is prone to drought and 7% is prone to floods. Farmers estimate that a farmer needs at least 3,000 cubic meters of water per hectare to grow one kharif crop and one irrigated crop. As a result, farmers rely on bore wells. However, excessive use of groundwater has significantly reduced the water availability underground. Water levels have dropped so much that it is common to find water only 500 to 1,000 feet below the surface. This drastic decline has disrupted natural springs and negatively affected groundwater temperature. Although people are now more aware of these issues, very few act to prevent the looming crisis. But there are notable exceptions. Just like Ramesh Kharmani, a retired army officer from Junnar Maharashtra. earthquakeásky을 자유리 ситуaciones.

Tirelessly working as a conservationist with the support of his dedicated wife Swati, this couple has dug 70 soak pits to recharge groundwater. These pits spanning 412 meters absorb an impressive 8 lakh liters of water during a single rainfall. A practice that they have continued since 2021. Soak pits are a traditional cost effective method for sustainable water management. They help water seep into water table beneath the soil. These pits store rain water which then replenishes the water. Continuous contour trenches are dug out one to two meters. They are a cost effective method for sustainable water management. They help water seep into water table beneath the soil. Continuous contour trenches are dug out one to two meters or even lesser one to two feet. And the excavated soil is collected on the downslope of the trench. Continuous contour trenches help in reduce runoff, help conserve the soil and reduce the speed of on-land flow of water. If there are large quantities of water, then the soil water actually percolates into the groundwater. And therefore sea cities are also considered as structures that help in improving the groundwater of the area. The Karmade couple did stop there. They created an oxygen park by planting over 500 trees on the same mountain with public support. These trees not only produce clean air, but also protect the environment by preventing soil erosion. These forests built him so far in the ». In the background, when separate greenhouse trying is pointer to trees leaf file then we exacerbate all the energyí. Ramesh's environmental efforts go beyond soak pits and tree planting. He has also addressed the problem of wildfires- fires, which have become more frequent due to global wobbing. To combat the wildfires, he cuts the dry grass into small patches and creates barriers that reduces the spread of fires during hot seasons and droughts. This approach is an innovative and effective way to prevent wildfires from spreading across large areas. Ramesh's work demonstrates how ideas, determination and relentless effort can make a real difference. Their initiatives serve as a shining example of what can be achieved through dedication and vision. Ramesh's dedication to water conservation has led him to restore neglected stepwells and tanks in the Junnar Taluka.

These forgotten water resources, called as Baravs, are hidden in plain sight, but are now being revived with the help of local youth who clear the vegetation, remove the silt and repair the structures. In today's fast-paced world, where people rarely dedicate time to nature without expecting anything in return, individuals like Ramesh and Swati are unique and truly a blessing. While most people focus on themselves, Ramesh and Swati stand apart as someone who nurture nature, which in turn gives generously.

Several individuals have contributed not only to create vast areas of continuous control trenches in afforestated areas or in barren areas, but they have also joined hands with government officials and with forest department to create unique ecological niches in the upland of Maharashtra. Their efforts in water conservation, tree planting, environmental protection and social service have earned many awards, including recognition from the government of Maharashtra and the forest department. Hearingع individuals like Ramesh and Swati that makes the world a better place. We should all strive to conserve water just as they do for the sake of our future generations.
