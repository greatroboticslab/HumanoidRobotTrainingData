 Well, we've kind of taken a position, or our position with data is that it is the customers' data. You know, and not every company is doing that. You know, there's some companies out there that the data belongs to them, and the customers can view it as well. But we view the data as the customers' data. Now, I know there's definitely some dealers that are considering and have engaged in data management for the customers. And that's really some of the dealers that I've talked to. They're talking, or their thought process, is to be a data storage facilitator for the customers. Then the customers can come to the dealer, request the data that they want, and then send it out maybe to a fertilizer dealer, or maybe have agronomic information added to it, you know, as a service that's provided by the dealer as well.
