 When a hurricane is approaching, safety of life and the preservation of livelihoods is most important. We should take heed. Fill 5-gallon buckets and other containers with water prior to the storm. You'll need it to water transplants in the greenhouse if you have lost power. Mulch as many bare rows as possible before the storm. Mulching will help prevent erosion and wind damage and will also minimize soil splashing into the crop canopy which can cause disease. Rib mature crops such as tomatoes and melons because they will split after heavy rains. Pick coconuts and consider harvesting cut flowers right before the storm as they will be easily damaged by rain and wind. Fortify any field trellises so you don't lose the crops they are supporting. Wherever possible, unhang trellis plants and place them to lay flat on the ground. Make sure tractors and other equipment and supplies are secured. Don't leave market baskets, picking crates, dip tape or irrigation pipes in the field or laying around where they can become missiles in high winds or get washed away by floodwaters. And stock up on gas for generators and other needed farm equipment. Remember, this is the hurricane season. And we should be prepared.
