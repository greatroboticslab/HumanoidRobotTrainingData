 In Japan, an innovative approach to watermelon cultivation has given rise to a unique and fascinating phenomenon, square watermelons. Unlike their traditional round counterparts, these watermelons are grown inside square boxes, resulting in their distinctive shape. Japan, known for its limited space, sought a solution to efficiently utilize available storage areas. By growing watermelons in boxes, farmers can stack them neatly, optimizing storage capacity and transportation efficiency. The process involves placing young watermelon fruits inside transparent containers, allowing them to grow and assume the shape of the box. This meticulous cultivation technique requires constant monitoring and precise adjustments to ensure the desired outcome. While the square watermelons do not differ in taste or nutritional value from their rounded brethren, they have become a symbol of ingenuity and resourcefulness in Japanese agriculture.
