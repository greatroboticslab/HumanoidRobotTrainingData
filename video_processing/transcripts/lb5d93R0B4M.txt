 The constraint on farms today in Asia, as in America, is largely because the management is not appropriate. It just clearly says to you, you've got to focus on the agronomy. The next big jump is going to be agronomy. How do you do agronomy? Where do you do agronomy? I've never known in 50 years maybe of a real impact coming from some sort of agronomic research that was experimented and evaluated and proven out of an experiment station. I just don't believe it. I think it's got to be done on farms under real conditions where the farmer is doing the planting incorporating whatever suggestions the specialist is telling them to do.
