 Music I thought we'd do a little update today on the chickens and how they're going in their new winter chicken coop. Music So it does smell a little bit in here. Kind of like a vinegary smell I guess I would say. So what that's telling me is we need more carbon. I'm just going to take some of this hay I have and spread it out and let the ladies go ahead and do their thing. Music So now all you gotta do is throw the flakes of hay down and let the girls do the rest of the work. Music Music Music Music They're just going to town scratching through it. Finding all the good stuff out of it right now to eat. Music Music Music Music And they'll spread it around. Music You kind of got to remember too that these chickens have been out on pasture their whole life until they come into this coop. So all this hay and everything. They love it. They're going to pick through it and they're going to eat it the best they can. They're not just going to use it for bedding. They're going to be eating this stuff. They've been out having fresh grass their whole life so they really look forward to this. Free range, free choice, oyster shells that they can eat so if they need more calcium in their diet they can go get it whenever they want. They're making their own dust baths. Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Where'd you make a Kris Music I'd love you to see these eggs coming from right now. Music Music Music Wow Music Again Google YouTube Music We only have 24 laying hens. Been doing pretty darn good I think. You'd almost think it's spring time with the amount of eggs we've been getting. They're really loving the greenhouse. They've been laying really good since they've been in here. They love all the fresh hay they get. As you can see, they're scratching through it and going to town. Even the ducks are loving it. Now even just since I put this hay down a few minutes ago, the smell in here has changed. There is no more smell. It's kind of like when you walked in you just kind of felt it hit you in the face. It was a little bit of like a vinegary smell. You put the hay down, the girls would come in, they scratched it all around and moved it and the smell has gone away. So the deep bedding really works. If you start smelling a nasty smell or a strong smell of anything, all you need to do is add some more carbon. In this case we're using hay. The girls are loving eating it. It's a food source for them. They get more fresh greens and it's a good carbon. I've just been using the lower nest boxes here. The upper ones I keep locked up. I don't want the girls just hanging out in here during the day and pooping up in here. So during the day I keep the lower nest boxes open. When I get home from work usually around like 5 o'clock I'll come in and I'll collect my eggs. I get my eggs out and then when I'm all done collecting the eggs I just shut it up and then that way at night the girls can't go in there and sleep and poop all over the place. That's usually when the nest boxes get really dirty. This right here, this hay is the same hay I put in the first time we set up the coop for them. It's still clean, there's no poop. The eggs we're getting out are nice and clean. The ducks love the water. They're just going to town. Everyone's making the biggest mess over there and I'm sure that's why we're going through the eggs. They're just going to eat 50 gallons of water a week. They sent our pigs off to the butcher shop a couple of weeks ago. We'll be getting those back pretty soon. I'm going to be going over how much pork and meat we got back from our pigs. We're going to be doing a breakdown of what we're getting back to the feed. All the noise the ducks are getting a little crazy over there in the water. We're going to be getting all of our meat back from the butcher shop on the pigs. I'm going to be going over to you what the feed costs were, what the butcher costs were, and how much money we have into the food.
