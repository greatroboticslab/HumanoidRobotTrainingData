 Have you ever wondered how land ownership changed the course of English agriculture? The enclosure movement, which began in the 15th century and peaked in the 18th, transformed communal farming into private land holdings. Enclosures allowed landowners to fence off common lands, leading to more efficient farming practices, but also displacing countless peasants. This shift increased agricultural productivity, spurring innovations like crop rotation and selective breeding. However, it also created social upheaval, as many were forced to migrate to urban areas, fueling the Industrial Revolution. The enclosure movement reshaped not just landscapes, but also the very fabric of society.
