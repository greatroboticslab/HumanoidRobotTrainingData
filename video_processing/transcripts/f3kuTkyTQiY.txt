 Well I wasn't planning on doing a video today but yet here we are down at the bottom of the garden in the greenhouse and it is a lovely lovely day. I don't know if you can quite see there but the the automatic window is wide open which shows you just how warm it is in here. It is beautiful. I was out playing golf on Thursday and it was horrible. It was wet. It was windy. It was a bit wild. It was awful but today is wonderful. So I've got two jobs I need to do today. First job I need to pot on the tomatoes. You remember a couple of weeks ago I was a little bit late getting them started but they're coming along. They're looking okay. They've been under the grow lights. I've had a bit of a dodgy setup sort of going on inside so they need to go on the proper grow cupboard thing. We've got upstairs in their own little individual cell trays because they'll come on leaps and bounds from there and I'll keep potting them up and moving them on and get them going because it's only going to be about I don't know four to six weeks before it's time for putting them outside in the polytunnel. So it's not long to go for that next job I've got to do and it's honestly it might seem a bit boring but it's one of the most satisfying jobs you can see done. You might remember again a couple of weeks ago we just started transforming this bottom area of the garden here tidying it up getting some new beds in stuff like that but what I did at the time was I sprayed down this patio cleaner stuff that's meant to take effect over time and it has and I'll show you in a bit will take effect but it needs jet washing so I'm gonna give it a bit of a jet washing this afternoon and there's nothing more satisfying I don't think I'm quite sad saying that but you know when you see the patio getting jet washing it's all dirty then it gets clean and clean and clean and it looks beautiful at the end of it so we'll get on we've just got a small section to do it's not going to take ages but we'll get on with that in a bit but without further ado let's have a look in here in the greenhouse cauliflower's looking good we started off a load of seeds I don't think I filmed this I had a bit of a seed sewing frenzy but it's going okay let's just pick this one here this one is some canasta lettuce and you can see there's some good good germination we'll keep the the little lids on now I've got the holes open on the top so there's some air getting in and out of there but they're coming on nicely we've got some brussels sprouts here as well two different varieties looking good coming on all right there as well I'll try not to trap them in the lid and I've got one on that side as well but everything is looking okay the beetroot over here is looking good the the cauliflowers have come along nicely these are the the onions yeah I mentioned these before the rinsberger onions and the little they're wee they've not done much they're still small I mean they're okay they're firm they're decent they're not floppy they're not dying nothing like that they're just not not grown very much and I did I did mention in my last video I wonder if it's maybe something to do with the compost so I gave them a bit of a liquid feed earlier in the week so we'll see we'll save the pickup we'll see if they go but I don't I don't know if it is the compost because the compost have used for everything and the the red barons that I put out are looking all right here's the the squash that's just germinated you can see it's absolutely flying and everything else is coming along all right the the other onions here which ones are these again the bedfordshire champions these were sown a lot later but you can see the size of them compared to the rinsberger but it's the same compost it's the same watering because I water everything at the same time when I come down they've had the same feed and whatnot but who knows but anyway the tomatoes are getting potted on today speaking of the tomatoes they're all back here on the super 7 I brought them along on the super 7 we've had some some great germination they're coming along nicely it's a little bit dry so they'll only need a good water and afterwards as well I'm going to do two different different sorts of potting on um I'm not taking you all on there's too many to do all of them we'll do two different types show you what I'm doing but we'll get a swap around here with the other cameras and stuff and we'll get some filming done right so we're going with the old dual camera setup again today hopefully it's going to work well it seems to go down all right when we do this in the greenhouse and I'm going to sew I say I'm going to sew the smart doors in two different ways you can see I've already done a row here why have I already done a row here because I've already filmed this but I don't think the audio was working properly so I'll film it again so we've already got one row in the cell tray so what you need to imagine now is me filling the cell tray with all this lovely compost down here now speaking of the compost this is the Melcote silver grow it's the one I use all the time for all the sort of seedlings and things I do all the sort of plants in and around the house anything I grow from seed anything I bring on any little plants I don't use it generally as a rule of thumb of the allotment it's a bit expensive you want to top up beds and stuff like that Melcote silver goads are wee bit expensive for doing that sort of thing so maybe think about a different type of compost for that but we'll sew these on in in two different ways and we'll we'll do these ones first so we've got the black strawberry ones and I say they're looking just a touch leggy I've not had the the grow lights set in the the perfect sort of conditions because I've just been a bit just a bit rushing and and all over the place and doing stuff but I'm going to try and get these set quite deep inside the cell tray and I'm trying to get them deep set inside the cells for a reason and if I just pick up this one here in particular and let me show you this up here if you can see that on the camera there's lots of little hairs all the way down the stem now what I want to do is try and get as many of those little hairs on the stem as deep as we can in the cell tray so I want it to be quite near this first set of leaves here so the little sort of flat leaves here you can see the ones don't have much shape to them they're the seed leaves and all the little jaggy ones that you can sort of see above that's the true leaves that are coming on so if we can get that stem planted knife nice and deep in theory all those little hairs that are on the stem will make beautiful beautiful roots for it to make nice strong plants and these ones I'm doing here are the black strawberry and for those of you who saw me sowing the tomatoes you will remember that I made a bit of a bit of a mistake for the black strawberry when I sold two lots of Brad's atomic grape and only zero lots of black strawberry and I had to go and fix it but once again thank you to everybody who spotted that or right about now and we'll be putting on Brad's atomic grape thinking they are black strawberry so thank you for that so you can see there we've got these in the cell tree now just by sheer chance sheer luck would have it on the super seven we've got seven of these little quarter size seed trays with seven varieties of tomatoes in the cell tray we've got has seven rows of four so I'm going to take four of each of these plants for me to take on for myself but I need to plant on some others and I'll come to that in just a second there let me pop that down and we've got these we've got some yogurt cartons but what I need to do first of all if I get my little my little snips here is we just need to put holes in the bottom now the reason I'm doing yogurt cartons instead of my normal plant pots or cell trays or whatever is because the rest of these plants aren't going to be for me and I've met I've mentioned this just sort of briefly once or twice before there you go look you can see the the holes in the bottom there so that the water can drain through and I've mentioned this briefly before that I'm part of a group here in Linlithgow called Linlithgow Farmily which is part of the Linlithgow Community Development Trust and it's all about help all aimed at helping people grow their own things at home learning how to do it help them out loads of tips and stuff like that we've got a fabulous Facebook group that people can come along and ask questions and learn how to do stuff but twice a year we have events and the first event we've already had which was was it last month crikey seems like ages ago now and that was a seed swap and the local allotment association comes along and they do some um seed potatoes as well so they sell seed potatoes and we do a seed swap both at the same time fabulous event and we always follow this up in May so it's around about the second or third week in May we'll be on Linlithgow High Street doing a seedling giveaway or seed or plant giveaway I should say some of them get quite big by then so all these little extra plants that I'm doing that I'm going to put in the yogurt pots and I've got my my stack of yogurt pots here I like to have a yogurt with my lunch every day so if they're stock stock of yogurt pots because I'm not wanting to give away my good plant pots so my my plant pots that I've got over here my plant labels and stuff and and whatnot I mean I will put a label in these so we'll know what they are so I'm not giving away random plants mystery plants come and get mystery plants so we'll not we'll not we'll not do that we will label them but the yogurt pots are brilliant because it's recycled it's reused and hopefully the person who brings on this this little plant can stay in here for ages and the person who gets this can use it hopefully use the yogurt pot to plant something else in once the little tomato plants out of it well that is job number one and kind of job number one and a half done let me show you what we've got we have got lots of tiny little potted up tomato seedlings there they all look a bit sad they always look a bit sad when you pot them up everything looks a bit sad they do need a good drink they're going to go into a to a gravel train we'll water them all from the bottom the compost going to soak up all that water give them a day to a good a good water and under the lights a bit of warmth and they'll look absolutely magic I don't expect them to be in this cell tray too long let me get nice and close just see you can see the size of it there the size of the cells that we're using you know be lucky if they're in here for two weeks before moving them on again into the next size up but it's the right way to do it because if you give them too much compost to get too much compost the roots don't grow very strong because the roots don't have to go off looking for nutrition at least when they're small they've got to find where the nutrition is then move them on move them on those roots just keep on growing at the right size plus you know behind schedule this year but you can kind of slow down growth if you keep them in the small cells the small pots a little bit longer than you need to you can slow down the growth a little bit but I need to speed things up at this time of year because it's it's getting beautiful outside and we've got our little ones here for the the seedling giveaway I know I was just saying there about having too much compost but these are these are going to be freebies for people but they're all little yogurt pots and again sheer coincidence there's two of each so there's enough two yogurt pots for each variety of tomato so we've got 14 little tomato plants so I'm going to do other stuff I've got some jiffy pellets over there watch out for that coming first time trying them trying something different for the seed seedling giveaway that we're going to be doing next month going to grow stuff in the jiffy pellets so again I'm not giving away plant pots using different things in different ways of doing things anyway next job on the list and the one I'm looking forward to I'm going to get outside let's get on let's get some jet washing done so that took a little bit longer than expected to get so if the horse pipe the big the good horse pipe is blocked or something it's not working so I've got my backup horse pipe on the go but let me just show you here this is the bit we're going to do you might remember say last weekend we came before whenever it was we sprayed all the cleaner down on it and it's come up pretty good you can see it's killed off all the moss and things that were on here but this is the pressure washer look we've got the double powerful nozzle thing on it it's the first time using it as well I got it I got it last year we've not had a chance to use it yet but I would love to show you all but it's it's over there oh it's hiding over there because the horse pipe we're using is a bit shorter but what I'll do is I'll pop a link down below in the description and you can go and have a look and see what it's like it came from screw fix um I've had the car show ones before I had a car show one before you know the yellow ones that you say if you're with not impressed didn't last very long did an okay job didn't last very long so I'm a little bit sceptical about the car show ones so we went for a different one a screw fix one like I say I'll pop a link in the description down below go and have a look see what it's like but the most important thing is does it work is it any good well there's only one way to find out job done let's have a look see how it looks and it looks pretty wet it's nowhere near dry but there is loads and loads and loads of mud and dirt and everything that's come off it so I'm looking forward to when it dries out when it dries out I will come along down here and show you this is the next bit I'm going to do over here let me just show you look at this this hasn't been done for years I did one slab over here just to show you the difference between the two but I'm going to get the the patio cleaner down on this it all needs brush there's bits of stuff all over everywhere it needs brush needs all the dirt away then it needs the patio cleaner put down then it needs to be left for a while then it needs to be jet washed and yes in case you're wondering it was very much an addition of boys with the toys at Mark's Allotment Plotia this afternoon filming by drone jet washing with a new jet washer what more do you want than on a beautiful Saturday afternoon anyway that's me done for today thank you for watching and hopefully I'll see you on the next one bye for now you
