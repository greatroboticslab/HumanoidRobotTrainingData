 I just kind of grew up rotating pastures when they said and just learning how to read the grass and kind of a take-half-leave-half mentality and we try to rotate every two to six days depending on pasture size and herd sizes but it's still important to get that rest and that rotation going. Those cows love to get to that fresh pasture and love that grass and they get pretty used to rotate.
