 What's up guys Ohio Grow Boys here with another unboxing. This is from one of my favorites and actually the first place I ever bought a marijuana seed is I Love Growing Marijuana. Today I'm going to give a special thank you out to I Love Growing Marijuana for supporting Ohio Grow Boys channel. And for supporting all medicinal, medical, recreational, all marijuana consumers. That's Gushers. We got Runt. Peanut Butter Bread. And Blueberry. These are all of those. I Love Growing Marijuana. Thank you very much. I will be doing a review on these seeds all the way through from beginning to end. You guys will get to see these germinated. You'll get to see them get through vegetation. All the way to flower. ILGM. Guys. This is the case where I bought my very first marijuana seeds. It was about eight, nine years ago. First place I ever bought any medicinal seeds online. And guys. They've always had a great customer support team. They're very quick about getting back to you. They're very polite. And they're very discreet. You can see there. There's nothing on that package telling you anything. I blacked out my name. Guys. Thank you for everything. Like and subscribe. Support the channel. Thank you.
