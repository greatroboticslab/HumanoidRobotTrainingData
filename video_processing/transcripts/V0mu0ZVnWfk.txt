I welcome you all to this course on fundamentals of agricultural extension on AGMOOC's platform in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and Commonwealth of Learning Vancouver Canada. The basic idea with which the course on fundamentals of agricultural extension is being launched is to give an orientation to the students on the basics of agricultural extension. You might be studying it as the part of your course curriculum as a part of undergraduate courses not only in agriculture, but in various other allied disciplines also. And as a part of the master's course also, you have a course like development perspectives of extension education, wherein the fundamental issues associated with the extension are being discussed. The course on fundamentals of agricultural extension is giving you appropriate perspectives regarding the concepts associated with the extension, the processes of extension, the principles of extension, what exactly the extension is and the because of certain misconceptions among the professionals there are what extension is not about. All these things are part of the discussion in this particular platform. The course is going to cover the topics like what exactly the extension is in which we will be talking of its definition, its principles, its objectives, philosophy, principles and all those things are part of this and what extension is not about. So, some people might be thinking of it as a propaganda activity, some people might be thinking of it as a advertisement activity. Some people are thinking it as a mass communication activity, journalistic activity, so on and so. There are certain misconceptions associated with this concept. So that we will be making it clear as a part of the discussion on this what exactly extension is not about. In addition to that, the processes of extension education and the program planning which are the essential skills to be understood by the extension professionals. So how the program is planned and what are the various steps and the stages of program development, the issues associated with that and in the pre-independence extension efforts that were done, the extension programs that were planned and implemented in the pre-independence era as well as a range of programs that were planned and implemented in the post-independence era are also part of this particular course. The logic behind going for historical aspects in extension education as well as the latest developments in the extension education include. So, how the technology or the society used to behave in those direction and what are the changes that happened over a period of time and what are the needs for the society are being understood with the help of this historic aspects. And based on that what are the current modifications that we have done and we can be doing in the future aspects that we will be learning from those past experiences. Coming to the post-independence extension system that I have already said about then the extension, innovations in extension and development are another important issues that we will be discussing as a part of this course wherein the latest developmental initiatives like ATMA, cyber extension and all those things will be part of this and the innovative models that emerged for providing the extension services will be part of this discussion. The new trends in extension like market-led extension, the privatization of extension services, cyber extension all these things are going to be part of our discussion wherein how the extension is changing itself in providing the services and meeting out the demands of end users or the clientele system. So, that are also part of our discussion. The concept of rural development because we have discussed enough about the rural development programs, but the concept of rural development is another important issue that is being covered as a part of this course and the issues associated with the adoption of innovation is also part of this course. And it ends with the consequences of innovation and before that various issues are being addressed.
