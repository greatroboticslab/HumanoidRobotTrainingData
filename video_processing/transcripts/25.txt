So, can you see the leaf holder? Alright. So this looks like a red one. So I'm going to put that down there and cover it up. And then there's another one. Right there. Up there. Then I'll get this one over here. I'm not putting them too far down. But just down there. I don't know. I'm not supposed to put it in each way. I'm supposed to put it in the dig a hole. I'm going to put the roots. Put that one right there. Then we have another one. Right here. Put this one right here. And a couple of months. So I have one more. So I'm thinking about for this one. I'm just going to put this one in another box. And... I'm going to put it in there. Alright. So I have another box. This is the biggest one I can find. It's a little smaller than the other two. But it's going to work. I'm going to go here and put the soil in here. So this almost feels as much stuff. So I'm going to add some of that. I'm going to put it in here. I'm going to work. And I'll put the tooth in here. And this is the most important part of the fertilizer. There is a lot of the fertilizer. I'll put it in there. There's a lot of the fertilizer. There's a lot of the fertilizer. I'm going to put it in there. so okay so here's the two water i'm gonna put this one right here in the middle cover it up and then i'm going to water so what i'm also going to do i'll probably get another bag just to fill these all the way up to the top uh i under missed estimate with the water coming all the way over here so one space store growing i'll just use the little belted the water in the canal and then do these hopefully it doesn't mess the box so i wonder should i put it across the board we're gonna see it's gonna be tried Lazarus the box is��ה it's not so much it's gonna prisoners i all right so i got the potatoes done so next thing i'm going to do um probably tomorrow i have some seedlings i'm gonna go ahead and start indoors um so um you know when the spring kick in so still got a little time but i'm gonna go ahead and start them indoors so i can transplant them um in six weeks so thank you guys for watching my garden channel god bless you eat what you grow and have a growthful day
