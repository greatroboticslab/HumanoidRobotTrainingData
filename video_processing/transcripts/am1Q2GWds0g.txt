 Today I'm going to demonstrate a simple way to plug the end of a header pipe. Plugging the end of a lay flat header pipe is quick, easy and necessary for the irrigation setup. There are various sizes of lay flat header pipe to choose from. For this reason, be sure to double check that your connector, fitting and plug are the same diameter as the pipe you are using. We are using a 2 inch pipe and 2 inch fittings. Because it is possible to find a one piece plug, but we have found them hard to find locally. So in this video, we are using a couple different fittings to make a plug. We wrapped teflon tape around the white threaded cap, screwed it into the gray barbed fitting and tightened it with a pipe wrench. Once you have the cap ready, place the clamp on the lay flat pipe. Next, put the barbed cap inside the end of the pipe. This part can be a little tricky, so gently twist and push the connector in until the barbed pipe is snug against the connector fitting. Another option is to put a full grade lubricant like Vaseline or vegetable oil on the outside of the connector so it slides on the pipe more easily. Push the clamp to the top of the fitting and using a flat head screwdriver, tighten the clamp. Now you are ready to attach the drip tape to the header pipe. We hope this video was very useful.
