 I'm Luke Dunn and I work for Reedy Creek Partners which is our family farm that's comprised of my father and my uncle my mother and myself and my wife we run a mixed farm here grazing cropping and livestock my background I'm from precision farming and we're yeah I'm always trying to find the most economical economical way to give the greatest efficiency in what we do and also be sustainable and look after our land since the drought broke ended sort of 2020 we got a lot of rain and we've had nearly four three to four really really exceptional seasons really really wet that's bought some of its own problems but every every time everything brings problems but yeah we've had good stock prices and yeah good yields good livestock and we've sort we yeah have done reasonably well so we've decided yeah to what we've made we're investing back in to continue on to be able to keep farming into the future and that's through waterworks and fencing and improving our pastures for the last a couple of decades I suppose we've moved to minimum to no-till mainly mintill improved pastures and native pastures on our grazing country and in the last droughts or the last couple of droughts we learned it was really important to maintain ground cover and since then in the last three to four years we've had high rainfall and good pasture growth and very little water runoff in our traditional dams and waterways and this has decreased our ability to have livestock on country that does have pasture but very very little water so yeah we've decided to put a couple of boars together and put a big header tank in and upgrade some pipelines and add new pipelines and interlink all our farming country and grazing country and start putting troughs in it's a big task and yeah the last couple of years we've embarked on doing that even through the dryer what would have been drier pinches and spells by having the rotational grazing being able to maintain the the feed body there and have the water is definitely certainly improving that we've noticed so we can yeah continue our stocking right through the year instead of de-stocking and restocking likewise so it's something we want to keep doing more more work so we can continue increasing our stocking rate i had some cropping country that we're slowly breaking down into rotational grazing country and they'll be they're basically 50 hectare paddocks or more and we'll be splitting them down into 20 hectare paddocks and then whilst we're doing the fencing we've been putting troughs in in the fence line so they can be divided by one one trough is being utilized between two paddocks and that's sort of helping keep costs costs down a bit but still providing the water there that's something we've done for a while and yeah it's worked well so we'll continue doing we lamb in our grazing country lighter country and it's traditionally that water runoff country that's what you were talking about iron bark country native grasses and we're currently we're doing an autumn our terminal use joined a terminal size are lambing down in that country at the moment and we wrote well we don't rotate we saw a set stock lamb but in small mobs of a hundred in twins and singles so each each paddock on the farm is getting utilized and each paddock needs to have water but there's there's several paddocks that we'll probably even go and look at possibly that don't have any water at the moment or just about to run out of water with with uh lambs at foot on the ewe which is yeah it's not really a good situation i'd like to thank the local land services for um providing it information and these updates because they're very helpful um they point out a lot of things that are going on or what other people are doing in the area that we might not be doing or that we can learn on i would try to attend most programs that are run by the ls awi dpi trying to always improve on what we're doing because we can always do stuff better trying to always improve our one percenters if you want to do something there's plenty of contacts to talk to and they've got good information and they're resources that are there they're independent of of any major companies or anything so they give out great advice and it's something that we should we as farmers and upcoming farmers should definitely support
