 I'm going to move around a little bit, it's just my style. My challenge today is to actually build on what was just said, to say, I don't actually think about the term big data anymore because to me big data is absolutely useless. Big data is only useful if you transform it into big decisions. So the challenge for Australian livestock species is to do exactly as I said before, is to merge what I consider big data into big decisions and actually equip the livestock industries to enhance the productivity. In the area that I work with there's some major changes that are happening in the livestock area. Suffice to say that we've probably seen in the last 12 months changes that we wouldn't expect in the last 10 years. My challenge is that producers are starting to operate more in sophisticated brand chains. They're starting to think about not only supplying on white and fat demographics, but also about how do they fit into the brand architecture? How do they fit into the brand DNA? How do they fit into the brand ecology? Now all of those three things are starting to really differentiate their producers and how they interact with the supply chains. Production driven by brand and production potentially locked more into brand. So when you actually become closer to the brand, one of the real challenges is you actually start to move away from that little bit of diversity that producers actually like. They like the opportunity of diversity. But with diversity comes cost reduction, and with that diversity also comes risk. So being aligned to brand has its ups and downs. Successful producers are really changing. They're starting to manage more information. They're starting to recruit themselves for animal information. There's more and more sensors coming in. I'll show you some examples of that. There's this big challenge of managing more and more animals with less labour. So corporate agriculture is moving into this area. The cultural changes happening in our particular space is that we are changing three or four hundred years of agricultural production. Most farmers and most family farmers that we've spoken about this morning have built themselves on dealing with complexity around visualisation of that complexity. They walk out into the paddock. They observe what their animals are doing. They observe what their feed is doing. They observe what's happening. With the advance of all of these sensors, you're changing that dynamic. Because they no longer walk out into the paddock to observe things. They're getting this tsunami of information presented to them. So I'll show you that in a couple of these pictures that are coming up. So we are about to see the cultural change of changing from visual agriculture to what I say is best driven as information driven agriculture built around these value chains. So transforming big data. So big data requires analysis and interpretation into information and then interpretation and insights into decisions. Now the size of those I've tried to capture a little bit. There's a heap of data. There's a little bit of information. And I had to put decisions into that circle only to fit decisions in. If I really wanted to say the size of decisions, it would be a pinpoint on that particular side. So we are investing heaps of money into agricultural data. We're not investing heaps of money into agricultural decisions. And in our area, the biggest goal that we'll have, particularly in southern livestock species, is integration of what I call the livestock enterprises with the cropping enterprises, with the pasture enterprises, with the soil enterprises, all of those things which are the multi-faceted areas of huge farming businesses. And there is not one single entity that's actually taken that role and responsibility on. MLA, the company I work with, we are very happy working about livestock decisions. GRDC, happy working about cropping decisions. The interface between our two areas will drive southern agriculture, and yet we still haven't had those discussions. So that is the role we need to do. So emerging technologies, objective measurements change in the area, and I know Tom and Troy will talk about that. Genetics and genomics. A couple of years ago, when we first started the CRC, we started characterising animals, and we thought if one or two genes we could measure that would be fantastic. Then we got something that was measuring 100 genes, then we got something that measured 1000 genes, then we got something that was measuring 50,000 genes, then we got something that was measuring 700,000 genes, now we're doing full sequencing of 3.5 million genes, and the interesting thing, full sequencing costs now less than what it was to get one or two genes five years ago. So all of that information is coming. And then when you say to the average, a C-stock producer, I know there are several in the room, not only are we going to give you this information around platyptops, we're going to throw you that full sequence information, that full sequence information is basically one gigabyte of information, you've got 100 cows, so we want to transfer down 100 gigabytes of information down on the current download speeds, they'll have a little heart attack. All of those things are emerging in that area. Then with this information management, how do you actually get all this information in? So, you know, we talk in terms of lean meat yield, we talk in single figures around percentages of lean meat yield. What happens if I actually gave you percentages of lean meat yield in 39 muscles across the body, I also gave you the meat colour of all those muscles, I gave you the pH of all those muscles, I gave you the marbling score of all those muscles, I gave you the consumer eating quality scores of all those muscles, and then I said, here's all this information, there's at least 39 muscles, I'll give you 10 pieces of information, go ahead and breed the perfect cow. Right? Producers can't even do one yet. They're a bit like merinos, they get to one and they can't count past that. So we're throwing all this information directly into their laps, and we're asking them to make such more informed decisions. And then you get through the time, and I'm a bit worried about that particular area. So we've got RFI-U tags and they're coming things, the Fitbits for livestock, I made a joke about three months ago in another forum, I said there'll be Fitbits for livestock, and I noticed yesterday or two days ago there was a major article coming up, but they've actually done exactly that, they've now got Fitbits for livestock, and they're actually thinking they're going to get improved, it's a breeding efficiency dairy cattle by about 10% through knowledge of that information. So sometimes when you make a joke, you've got to be careful about the outcome. GPS tracking, we're doing all of those things, so we now know virtual stocking rates, we now are changing our fencing lines, we're changing our pattern of resource utilization based on this information. We've got drones and sensors that are going up in that area, we've got water and fence sensors happening all the time, and the area that I'm most excited about is this biological tattoos, where you start to put in tattoos on individual animals with biologically active inks, and they caress at different frequencies, and that caresses tells you about the wellbeing of animals. Now wouldn't that be exciting when you walk out in the paddock and all the heifers are bright green, so you know that they're all happy. Now, or more importantly, wouldn't it be really good if you put the drone up, and they saw all these bright green heifers, and they actually reported back to you in your office when you're sitting inside the pool having a drink, all your heifers are happy. Now that's not too far off. Again, that's going to change the face of agriculture, and particularly the livestock. Again, it's going to take a visualization out. It will change management skills. As Philip said earlier, I'm starting to see that we're going to change away from farm managers to what I call a systems engineers. Systems engineers actually take all of this information and make effective decisions. They're not managing anymore, they're decision makers. And again, that's a change in agriculture. The areas, again, Chris and Pip will talk about it in her session, I encourage you to go and listen to that later on. There's all of these hyperspectral cameras and new x-rays, all of this information that's going on, it's just going to throw this amount of information back to livestock producers. More importantly, how do they make effective decisions about all this information? How do they balance up the fact that we tell them that lean, meat, yield and eating quality have a big negative correlation? If you're not fitted into value-based marketing, you have to adjust to that negative correlation. The real value is actually optimising on those two principles. You throw a neural network at it, here's the optimal profile for exactly the numbers of animals that you need in each of these sequences. And in northern beef industry we're doing exactly that. We're starting to say, based on your genetic profile, based on the rate of growth you've had up to 200 days, you go on a boat and you go to a processing office. That's the type of information that's going to come forward. And again, paced technology. That little thing, that's a NICS colour sensor, that costs about $300 US. It links to your iPhone, it does a really good job of objective colour in both beef and sheep. We think that we'll put all of these little NICS sensors into a range of supermarkets, basically get crowd-sourcing information back as each of the consumers picks up the piece of meat, tells us whether they like the meat colour or not, and they come back next time, they use the little sensor and they tell us whether they like the product or not. So instead of having one or two thousand pieces of information, suddenly we might have a hundred thousand pieces of information, consumer capability of eating quality meat colour on a daily basis. Won't that transform our agricultural production will go? Won't that transform our companies' integrations? So it's becoming increasingly complex. So the biology of agriculture, particularly livestock systems, I think producers, and particularly livestock producers, do a fantastic job of dealing with complexity in decision making. What they don't do well is actually handle the complication of complexity. And we are throwing more and more complication to that complexity. We are making decisions metric by the minute. And that is going to influence how we do those areas. So it doesn't matter where you sit in the supply chain, this increasingly complex system, or moving from complex to complicated, is going to be a real challenge. And to show you, here's the Red Bean Value Chain. This is all the information that we've got that's going across there. There's a whole heap of information. All of these traits are coming in place. The really interesting thing is there is not one common set of language or standards that goes across that whole agricultural profile. There's heaps of information collected to that. And not one half of each of those sectors talks to each other. There's no standard nomenclature right the way across that spectrum. So goal of decision making, understanding these whole areas. So livestock enterprises, my challenge for the livestock producers, in order to really grapple with big decisions and big data, understand resilience and adaptability of your production system. Understand where the peak points are going to be. There's going to be huge opportunity not to live productivity. I think people focus on productivity a lot in the supply chain, at least in the meat supply chain I work in. The cost of non-compliance to livestock production far outweighs the cost of any improvements we can make in productivity. So people producing things to a market end point after six or seven hundred days and getting that wrong is far greater cost to the industry than lifting productivity by two or three percent. And as an example with the cost of non-compliance and a couple of supply chains I've worked in, it's about $52 an animal. The dark cutting, which is one industry issue, it's $1.92 a kilo. It's a $50 million issue that can be sold just with the data that we've got available today. So they are big gains in getting rid of non-compliance. So less waste of resources are probably the thing for agriculture more than anything else. What are going to drive some of these things? As I said before, compliance to market specification, there's $30 to $85 a head. Value-based marketing, well I've gone away from the term value-based marketing. In livestock it's value-based pricing. When you actually have value-based pricing, then you allow the value changes in the market. Producers shouldn't get involved in that area. Business efficiency and profitability, they're all going to leverage this information and data to information to decisions, identifying where those key areas is going to be quite important. And from an R&D point of view, when you actually use that type of area, you will radically change investment portfolios in R&D. If you know where the key points of transactional efficiency are, you will change where you invest in R&D dollars. And at the moment we apply a shotgun approach to that type of area. So lots of databases. MLA, we're lucky to be the custodians of a range of different databases. So we've got NLIS, MEC Standards Australia, Livestock Data Link, the National Livestock Reporting System. Where the custodians of breed plan, where the custodians, sorry, with ABRI, sheep genetics, on-farm software, breed societies are all involved in that, Animal Health Australia. So there's all of these databases that come in on board. Very few of them actually integrate together to form big decisions. So in one area, a little bit of on-farm software now is linking the National Livestock Recording Service with the Bureau of Meteorology to sell a little bit of information about when we sell and what to feed. Probably about 2% of livestock production is starting to actively make that product decision. Then we get a little bit more complicated when we link those, NIS, with V Standards Australia, with Livestock Data Link, together with breed plan and chief genetics and the research databases to improve the information of eating quality. And to show you how complex our challenges are, in the area of Med Standards Australia, last year we graded 3.2 million animals. Each of those had measurements of intranosculopat, measurements of colour, measurements of ossification, all those other challenges. We have a national genetic database and breed plan with the breed societies, which is basically the world's best at the moment. How many records out of that 3.2 million do you think went back into the genetics database to influence genetics? What do you got here? It's greater than zero, but not by much, so it's 611. Right? So the other 2.9 million plus, we lost in terms of that contribution to the genetics database. And in our case, MLA manages both of them and we can't even connect them now. So that's a challenge we have. And here's an example of where the real value actually lies. Tom will probably use this later on in his talk. Value-based marketing pilot. If we actually understood the complexity of lead net yield, if we actually understood the complexity of eating quality, if we can apply that to the system, provide that information back to producers, over 105,000 animals, there's 18.8 million dollars difference between paying on weight and fat versus paying on real value-based agriculture. So there's about 120 to 130 dollars per animal by getting that decision right. That's a huge opportunity for the Australian agriculture industries to look at. So we've got a whole heap of things there, benchmarking, and I won't go through those, but benchmarking, raising systems, cost of compliance. The area that I want to see our industries get much more involved in, the BCA is about supporting investment strategies. We saw this morning about investment in agriculture. The problem with our investment in agriculture is we are not using big decisions to make that investment decision for us. So we can do a lot more of those areas. Health and welfare, we spoke about brand DNA earlier on, there's going to be this quantum need for Australian agriculture to start to underpin brands with information that supports the brand integrity in both domestic and international communities. And all that requires information coming from farm right up through the value chain. So to deal with that complexity is going to be a challenge. Then you get measurement of R&D investment, all those other things. And the point in line is total farm productivity or profitability. It's the key area of big decisions. Now, at the moment, with big data, we are making no in-rides into that area. With big decisions, we can probably transform that with about a 5 or a 10% increase. That's the type of quantity we can see in agriculture. And value chain efficiency is just a start. To give you an idea of what's already out there, this is the Irish system. So the Irish, and you think the Irish are a little bit backwards, and apologies for those people Irish in the room. But I have a lovely piece of legislation that said if you breed cattle in Ireland, you have to be part of that system. It's great. Wouldn't that be a great piece of legislation to put into Australia? But it means every animal in Ireland is fully genotyped. Every animal, all the transactions right the way through its lifetime are made. When it goes to the abattoir, every piece of information is actually captured in the abattoir. All of that information is fed back into a national database, and that's all made available back up into decision-making around genetics and chenosis. Completely integrated right the way through the system. You have to be part of that. Now, the really good thing is the Irish tapped into the European Agricultural Commission, and they got something like $70 million to instalment. And we don't have the luxury of doing that top of the area. So, that's our challenge. Farm IQ in New Zealand, the air civil system with New Zealand, that's about $187 million to do. Now, we're talking about in MLA about putting a system that's going to cost us $2-3 million. We're not even in the right ballpark when it comes to these types of decision-making. So, the lesson learned from others about talking and things, and we've got a review out at the moment. It's about getting everybody in the same room and thinking about where the weekend situations actually are. So, looking for people to make decisions and outcomes. And the real key about integration across the livestock chain is that you've got to create a win-win based on aggregation, and aggregation leads to decisions. At the moment, Mick might talk about later on about open access platforms around data. Well, the real key for us in livestock is open access around the algorithms that involve the decision-making. Because at the moment there is no confidence in a lot of those algorithms that involve the decision-making. So, we've got to get to that. No one really knows what big data is. And we think everybody thinks it's going to be important. Everybody's applying a consistent approach to the principles to address that. There's democratic data, there's the delivery through public available APIs and everything like that. You talk to everybody, everybody thinks, yes, I'm involved in big data. You talk to everybody about how to use big data, I'm collecting it. Collecting big data is not using big data. Everybody wants to be part of it. And everybody thinks that because they've got data, they've got value in big data. And people have yet to work out the only value in data is when you aggregate that data to make a decision. And we have got to place a real cultural change in agriculture about moving away from IP protectionism to an open source platform that allows big decisions to be made across agriculture. Because at the moment we're moving the other way around. Information about genuine value. Creating genuine value in the supply chain or the value chain is a real critical thing. You can make decisions, you can give advice on those type of things, but unless they lead to tangible value, there'll be no impact on agriculture. As I said before, data by itself is not valuable. And people are putting all of these restrictions around data because they think they own the data. The real key is to own the algorithms that aggregate the data. That's where the real information is going to be collected. And actually making them public source and those type of areas is going to be a real effect. And people think that providing data entitles them to more value. So I've listened and we've worked with people recently that said, I'm giving you this data and in return for this data, I expect this. Now in many cases you can't actually predict what you're going to give them. So how can you actually take their data without actually understanding what you're going to give them back? And that's going to be the learning experience we work over in the next couple of years. And then industry-owned data. I mean, as an RDC about three months ago we blindly went into the belief that we should set up a single national database, set up all these algorithms, do all these wonderful things, control the law. But a lot of consultations led us to believe our role is firstly helping set the standards, and secondly helping set the framework about how you create the algorithms and make decisions. It's not our role to pull the data together, our role is to coordinate and facilitate the opportunity to do that. So my challenge for the industries are data is increasingly more complex, it's complicated than volumetric, and if you think farmers are struggling with day-to-day decision making, they are. They're struggling with drought decisions, they're struggling with all these things, and suddenly we're going to put this huge pressure on them to cope with the information that's coming back to them. And I have already started to see some of the producers struggling, particularly in the sea stock industry, struggle with that transition from visual to information driven decisions, and that is creating culture change. Big data must generate capacity to drive big decisions, so I hope everybody walks out of the room with thinking about big decisions rather than big data. And the key barriers engaging everybody along the value chain, and listening to what Philip said earlier about changing the value chain, that horizontal platform of information transfer is yet to be discussed, because we haven't yet had a real conversation about agriculture, about integrating livestock with pastures and cropping and soils. Everybody's walking in their own silos, and that big decision about integration is yet to come. Thanks very much. Thank you. .
