 Hello guys, I'm back again, Dylan, and today I'm going to be showing you my refined farming system. This is much simpler, it uses normal pistons instead of sticky pistons. The layout is a lot simpler, not as complex. I even made it underground, and the redstone isn't as complicated. So first, I'm going to show you the floodgates. The floodgates are normal pistons that are activated to hold the water back, a single source block of water, and they're hooked up to a single redstone trail by this lever. Basically, the lever hits off the first repeater, and then splits off to the first piston, and then it comes up, hits another repeater, and goes all the way to the other piston around that corner. Now, to show you it, how it works. Also, I made it three wide rather than two, so you can get more wheat. You can get 90, fit 90 wheat on here. 90 wheat, 90 plants on here, whatever you want to call it. I don't know what you want to call it. But basically, when you turn this off, floodgates open. And you can walk along here to collect the items rather than walking in the water. And basically, that's it. You can also use this for mushroom farms. You know, whatever you want. So, I hope that was helpful. And, um, goodbye.
