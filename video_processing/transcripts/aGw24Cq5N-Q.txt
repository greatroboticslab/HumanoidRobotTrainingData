 Sustainable food and agriculture are at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. One of the ways of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals is through agroecology. Agroecology helps ensure food and nutritional security, reduce poverty, mitigate climate change and restore ecosystems by promoting farming practices that increase crop resilience and biodiversity, sequestering carbon in soils and improving local livelihoods. FAO and its partners contribute to the global efforts by providing training and policy support on agroecology. Today, Agroecology has reached 3000 villages. In the next 5-7 years, we plan to reach all 6 million farmers in the state of Andhra Pradesh and cover the 8 million hectares of land in the state of Andhra Pradesh into the Agroecology program. We are experiencing tremendous benefits through agroecology, better livelihoods and better health, and better health of our soils and more biodiversity in our fields. Farmers are able to reduce their costs of cultivation, reduce their risks and increase their yields and also the price realisation. The most important innovation in this program has been the farmer to farmer extension. So the best practicing farmer or the champion farmer is the most important trainer. The best practice of farming is the most important factor in the field of farming practices. We are very thankful to FAO for the concept of farmer field schools. This innovation is helping us immensely in making knowledge dissemination not so much as a top-down approach but where the participants are discovering together the various agroecological principles. The second major innovation is the extremely critical role played by the women's self-help groups. And the women's self-help groups in the state of Andhra Pradesh have been nurtured over the last 20 years. So they are very mature and very experienced collectives. So through these women's collectives, the agroecology program is receiving tremendous boost. The agroecology program is receiving tremendous boost. We have been able to come to the land of the land of the land of the land of the land. Agroecology has the potential to accelerate the transition to sustainable food systems and contribute to ecosystems restoration.
