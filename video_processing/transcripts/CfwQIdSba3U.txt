 Hi, I'm Zooming with Kent Vlieger, South Dakota's soil health specialist, just to talk about a series of videos that Kent shot in May 2020. Kent, we have eight videos we'd like for folks to see and I wondered if you could give us a little bit of context of why you were in the field shooting these videos. Sure, so like you mentioned Buzz, the 2019, really the whole calendar year was very wet in South Dakota. Most places had twice their annual precipitation, a lot of prevent plant and we went into winter freeze up really still quite wet. A lot of rivers were still in flood stage and going into winter. So this spring there was quite a bit of anxiety on whether we were going to kind of have the same disaster we did last year since we had so much moisture already in the soil profile. And so what we were looking to do is show some of these fields and conditions and we were really looking to show some producers that have been practicing soil health practices for some for a couple decades and some a little shorter term and just to see how they were handling all that excess moisture from the previous year and if they were having any success with planting or what some of the challenges that they were facing. All right, thanks Kent. That gives us an idea of what to expect. Hey, I hope these videos are going to be useful to producers especially as they start thinking about 2021. do so
