 Hi, my name is Michael Robinson. I'm a research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Food Systems at KPU. I'm here today to share a little bit about our hog research project, specifically to take you through the process of moving the hogs into a new rotational grazing plot. So, as you can see here, we begin by unhooking the fence from the back edge of the previous grazing plot and moving it up into its new position. This allows the hogs to move into their new plot. They're pretty well trained by this point, and with little hesitation, they move into their stand to field bees' notes. Well, not always necessary. We like to ensure the hogs stay in their new plot with a little extra feed. Good big, good big. Good big, good. Good big, good. Next, we move their shelter into the plot. These are a mobile shelter, designed to be moved by one or two people and to comfortably house both hogs in each plot. and to comfortably house both hogs in each plot. While the hogs are distracted with the food, we move the back fence up and close them fully into the new plot. The last thing that needs done is moving and setting back up the barrel water system we use for these hogs. Bottom one on. Bottom one on. Move the water. Bottom one. This move took us all of three minutes. We think that rotational grazing systems like this really represent a great option for raising hog on pasture. It's low labor and the materials needed are quite affordable. Alright. Finally, we wanted to say thanks for watching. We hope something in this system people find useful. Stay tuned for more videos demonstrating some of our infrastructure, day before move prep, and more.
