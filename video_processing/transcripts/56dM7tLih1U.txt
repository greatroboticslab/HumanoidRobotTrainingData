Science & Technology
 I'm really happy that this morning we can welcome for our keynote speaker someone who really is exemplifying the solidarity that Jimmy has so rightly suggested we need. You mentioned that Vex and medics don't always work that well together and we're now going to hear from a veterinarian who is working in a medical institution and developing vaccines which are appropriate for use across that divide in both livestock and humans. Professor George Warimwe is a veterinarian who is the a PI at the KEMRI Wellcome Trust unit here in in Califi and is a assistant professor in the Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health at the University of Oxford. He has just been awarded an incredible prize by the Royal Society, the Royal Society Africa Prize for his work on viral zoonoses and he's going to talk to us today about his experience as someone who crosses these boundaries and the development of a Rift Valley fever vaccine suitable for use in humans and livestock. So with that I would like to pass across to Professor George Warimwe and we're really looking forward to hearing from you today so thank you so much. Thank you Leigh and I'd like to first start by thanking all the organisers for this fantastic conference. I mean One Health has been on the fringes for a very long time but it's now sort of centre stage and this is our opportunity to really push this agenda that really makes sense in terms of disease control. So I really like you know following Jimmy Smith's talk I mean that's that's going to be a tough act but there are some things that he mentioned about siloed thinking and in all the sort of different facets that we deal with in health and you know my view of One Health in this space of vaccinology is looking at developing vaccines for humans through the lens of animal health and vice versa. So if you're developing vaccines for veterinary you know for veterinary use looking at the the impact of those vaccines and the development process from a human perspective. So I'm going to talk about the programme that I've been working on for a while now so this started sometime in 2012 which tells you about the sort of scale of time that you need to develop vaccines and also speaks to the sort of rapid development of Covid vaccines that we have seen because that has been shrunk down to about 100 days. So it's about developing a single vaccine for using humans and livestock against reef valley fever. This audience I don't think I need to talk about the importance of animals to human health for this particular audience. In fact this is a photo taken among a collection of lots of photos on the Ilry Flicka site so I would urge you all to look at that. It's got fantastic visual representations of the importance of animal health to humans and I like this photo because it just demonstrates the pure joy that animals bring to humans especially children. But of course we also know about the economic importance, the you know there's been lots of studies demonstrating the impact of life you know animals to livelihoods, financial security. I always mention that I was only able to go to university because my grandparents who raised me own an animal and they saw that animal and that generated income you know some funding for me to go to university. And I'm sure there are many others in the audience who have similar stories. One of the other things we share with livestock are infectious diseases. In fact over 60 percent of infectious diseases in humans have involved an animal sort of transmission and for the emerging infectious diseases that we're seeing now that you know that are increasing in incidence that percentage is much higher. So when you're thinking about controlling human disease it just illustrates the point that you also have to think about animal health just because of that connection. So I'm going to talk about Rift Valley Fever which is a virus that was identified in Kenya in the 1930s. It is an RNA virus in the family if any very day. There are no vaccines available for it or no specific therapeutics which is why it has been prioritized by the African Union and the World Health Organization. So RVF has a complex transmission cycle by complexity meaning that you know for me it involves quite a lot of mammalian species and lots of mosquito species. So but the simplistic sort of explanation is that you have very heavy rainfall that causes floods which increases the number of mosquitoes to transmit the virus. Sorry. That are able to transmit the virus. This increase in mosquito numbers allows a mechanism for the virus to circulate in animals. Some of the mosquitoes are infected you know for life. The eggs are you know if they had had a blood meal that has infectious virus the virus has you know gone through its progeny through the eggs and so the virus transmits I mean the mosquitoes transmit the virus in animal species most commonly sheep goats cattle and camels and during these epidemics where where you have very high levels of viremia viral load circulating in these animals the viruses can then the mosquito can then transmit the virus to humans or also to wildlife. Now the virus sort of has been detected in wildlife by way of sero-prevalent studies but the impact of RVF in in livestock is really not fully understood but in domestic ruminants like you know the ones I've mentioned you get the amount of animals and of course in young animals the mortality is much higher this is over 90 percent and you know the classic uh the classic sort of hallmark of disease is abortion storm so nearly all animals in a farm that are pregnant would abort. In humans the disease is described more like flu-like illness with very non-specific symptoms but a proportion of these individuals develop severe disease with high case fatality rates and and there's been some sort of evidence although anecdotal suggesting that the case fatality has been you know of recent epidemics in humans has been rather high so ranging from about 30 percent at least for from the east african uh outbreaks so where is RVF common it's predominantly in Africa and um these maps you know are like you would have seen maps like this for all sorts of things basically the darker it is the the more uh cases there are or have been reported uh on the left you've got humans on the right you have livestock the most important thing here to note is that there is a lot more um cases of RVF reported in livestock uh than in humans which possibly just illustrates the the poor sort of surveillance systems in in humans in some of these settings uh the other thing you will note if you will note is that uh Kenya and South Africa or East Africa and Southern Africa tend to be really severely affected by RVF outbreaks just based on the number over the previous years so what can we do to control RVF uh we have licensed uh inactivated uh vac and live vaccines for they're using in livestock uh these have some safety drawbacks and some need multiple doses to uh generate an effective immune response you need high containment for their production because it's an actual sort of RVF virus that you're dealing with whether inactivating it or modified in some way um and it's not they're not diva compatible so you cannot differentiate uh vaccinated animals from um non-vaccinated animals because the antibody response to the whole virus is similar to that that's caused by natural infection so there are no licensed vaccines for human use and so the the the thrust of this program has really been about developing a vaccine for for human use but also developing safer uh vaccines that can be used in livestock this is a very old um table from the 1930s just all i want to demonstrate here is that uh a humoral immune response so an antibody response is sufficient for protection uh because of time i i wouldn't really go into the table but but you the point i want to sort of make is that if you pass you can't do that into animals again you can confirm protection uh suggesting that antibodies are important we also have from very many studies that have been done over the years demonstrating that neutralizing antibodies uh correlate with protection and so if you're thinking about a target for a vaccine uh you know construct you want to develop antibodies you know develop a vaccine that can elicit neutralizing antibodies and we finally we know that uh if you recover from rvf infection then this neutralizing antibodies tend to be long-lived and this is just a case demonstrating that an individual had neutralizing antibodies up to 25 years later without um exposure in the intervening period which is uh really remarkable so we know what the the target of these neutralizing antibodies are it's the surface of the viral glycoprotein of the of the virus now these are viral glycoproteins known as gn and gc uh the the the analogous sort of situation here is the spike protein for coronavirus so it's like targeting the same sort of surface of the virus it's an enveloped rna uh virus so we set out to use the chadoks one platform uh because at that time the chadoks one vaccine platform which is basically just a vehicle to deliver the vaccine had been used in humans and had been shown to be safe in humans this is very important as a sort of starting point for a human vaccine because you've already saved so much costs by having uh already a track record in in the safety profile you will i will talk about the costs of developing vaccines later but the chadoks one platform uh was safe in humans uh previously when used for other vaccines and all we did basically is get the targets the the genes that encode the virus uh rvf gn and gc and uh you know inserted this into the chadoks one uh vector which when in when you vaccinate an individual gets into the cell uh expresses the the proteins and these uh rvf glycoproteins then uh stimulate an immune response and hopefully you've got a very high immune response to confirm protection so the methods of manufacture were already well established so it really was a matter of plug and play so this image just illustrates the um the sort of uh pipeline for development is it's simplistic uh but it just illustrates the point we've had the preclinical discovery period where we identified the rvf i mean inserted the rvf gn and gc into the chadoks one platform uh the plan was to do preclinical studies in mice uh and then go on to livestock trials and human studies and if you know hopefully if it all works well then you'd have a single vaccine uh for using multiple species so um the first uh really encouraging data we found was that if you immunize mice and expose them to rvf virus uh two months later uh you had 100 protection and um you know this was very exciting whereas the group that uh were given a placebo uh did not uh you know were not protected and succumb to infection so the next sets of uh studies in in livestock were studies that we did um in very close partnership uh with ilry uh with vishnana and others and the idea here was to immunize animals and following um follow them up for a month for immune response to to develop and then expose them to rvf virus so this is a typical approach of evaluating vaccines so the long and short of it was that a single immunization uh in all those species provided 100 protection so none of the animals that received chadoks were chadoks one um developed disease and in fact as illustrated on this on this plot the with the blue representing chadoks one group and the black representing the licensed product and the uh gray representing placebo all the chadoks one vaccinated animals mounted a neutralizing antibody response uh for the rift vacs which is available in kenya as a you know rvf vaccine uh two of the animals one in you know cattle and goats did not mount a neutralizing response then were not protected further supporting this idea that um neutralizing antibodies are the main sort of thing you need to elicit to mount an immune response so the publication is up there if anybody wants to to follow that so the next step was to look at rvf in pregnancy again using a similar uh experimental design where you vaccinate uh for this we vaccinated early in gestation and challenged them later with uh with a with a virulent virus and then monitoring the safety of the fetus and also protection so these studies were done in the netherlands with uh uh jerome kotakas and others um and the top uh panels represent the results of the vaccine development in in sheep um and the bottom are the goats so that both i mean in both species the the antibody response was uh really very high it was within the range we observed in the kenyan study uh artillery um and and uh the the chadoks one vaccinated group in red here were um were protected against uh viremia so you see the viral load there it just means that the animals were protected against you know rvf infection there was no illness in the pregnant uh animals um and no sign of infection in the fetuses in in sheep um in the goats again we got we had very high levels of uh protection although two of the 25 uh fetuses uh succumb to infection suggesting that there might be uh differences in the uh either the mechanism of protection or other factor in in goats in terms of uh the level of protection that you see following vaccination but the primary aim of this uh experiment really was to demonstrate that the chadoks one vaccine was safe which is something that current uh you know most of the vaccines currently uh are unable to you know show you know that we we really don't have any vaccines that can be used in pregnancy other than uh the inactivated versions that need uh multiple immunizations so this was a really um good point to sort of uh get that you know proceed from uh yeah so uh the next step was to look at the now that we've demonstrated the um the safety of the product in uh in pregnant and non-pregnant animals and showed you know very high levels of protection we the next step was to conduct a field trial looking at the um whether the vaccine elicits uh a similar you know performs as well as the licensed product in a study that is powered to evaluate that at a sort of uh population level so the previous studies were designed to look at efficacy uh you know for the first study and the second one was to look at safety in pregnancy whereas this is now looking at a field level and these are studies that we did in uh capiti where we um looked at a hundred uh 180 animals per species so this is with the as indicated there those are study protocol and this study was done to very high levels very high standards so uh to gcp and i believe is probably the largest uh sort of gcp veterinary trial that's been done globally uh i haven't had anybody object to that in the different places i've talked about this um so as i say the study is done in kenya is it's in helping on pregnant animals and the animals were followed up for a year and the end point of the trial the thing that we will use to say whether the vaccine performs as well as a licensed product is a neutralizing antibody titers now i don't have the results for this but um analysis is underway uh but should be available sometime early next year but the whole point is that this data will be used to support the registration of the product for use in east africa and other and other countries uh in africa where there's very high uh sort of exposure to rvf so i'll switch gears a bit so now we're moving to humans so that the veterinary development is of course very advanced uh and we are now you know at the point where we're thinking about registration but how about the human study so we've begun a phase one study in humans in oxford and this is uh the typical uh approach is to start with a low dose go to a medium dose and a high dose for any of you who've been following uh you know the oxford astrazeneca covid 19 vaccine development you would have seen some of this sort of experimental designs uh or trial designs very early on so this this sort of phase one study is is done in a small number of participants with the aim of just looking at the safety profile of the product and of course whether it also elicits an immune response the desired immune response so we already have for the platform in general so chadox one in general we already have over safety database over a billion doses of course because of the oxford astrazeneca covid vaccine but now we want to add data specific to the rvf vaccine and so far the vaccine is performing well both in terms of the safety uh and the immune response and again we expect this data to be ready you know for sort of dissemination uh sometime early next year so i've taken that fairly quickly just because of time but but the summary of this work is that uh you know we've identified very high levels of protection in livestock uh the vaccine is highly efficacious and safe in pregnant uh ruminants and the safety and immunogenicity is expected to be as good as current licensed vaccine which is the sort of the smithband vaccine supplied by uh kevvapi analysis is ongoing as is the analysis of the human phase one study uh that uh is going to be available as from next year so in terms of so for the veterinary uh development the veterinary use of the product um that has a clear sort of pathway um that we would follow for the um uh stipulated by uh the local regulators um and you know nba the the veterinary medicines directorate and and sort of and there is a actually a harmonized process for for doing this in eastern africa but how about the the human landscape now one of the most difficult things to do as as you know the audience might appreciate is to predict when the next um roof valley fever outbreak would be if you if if you are to predict that with very high sort of confidence you would be able to design uh a vaccine efficacy study so um but in the absence of that it becomes really difficult to predict uh you know to design a vaccine efficacy study for you for uh rvf so an alternative approach would be to use correlates of protection as done for other vaccines so we know you know the threshold the antibody threshold you require to provide protection against rabies for instance and even yellow fever for instance um another another route is to think about an animal rule which is something that's done by the fda in the us but uh because this is a problem rvf is a problem that's predominantly restricted to africa and the arabian peninsula i think we think that there is a need to engage the regulatory um national regulatory authorities in the continent about the the best sort of strategy towards licensure this vaccine whether it's uh emergency use authorization as we have been as we have seen for uh cobit 19 and then followed by sort of a a phase three study where you're looking at uh efficacy evaluation if ever there was a massive uh sort of epidemic you also need to think about what vaccination regimen uh is going to be eventually used and so this relies on doing um further studies phase two studies where you look at uh a single dose versus two doses and and which of those performs well and think about the deployment and how would you deployment this vaccine would you deploy it in humans only or would you deploy it in humans and animals during an epidemic and you know this sort of thing calls for uh you know massive stakeholder engagement including the bodies listed there so very much a one health focused sort of uh um strategy also not just in the making of the vaccine and and the planning of the experiment but also in the future work on the deployment of the product so i think uh we'll stop there um sorry yeah i'll stop there and just acknowledge that this is work that has involved um very many partners and uh at the center of this has been the international livestock research institute very close partners there uh as i mentioned earlier but also i can just or not i cannot overstate the importance of uh engagement with the um regulatory and policy stakeholders including the national biosafety authority and the ministry of agriculture livestock and fisheries because this would not have been possible without their support um and you know and and guidance through the through the process uh at ilri uh you know campus and capiti so i think i'll stop there and uh hand it over back to you leon or for any uh other questions thank you so much george for that great great talk um and uh there's lots of questions in the chat um but i'm going to just jump in uh with one that's maybe a little bit less technical we talked a bit at the beginning about the the difficulty of breaking down silos so i'm going to ask you a personal question um as as a a veterinarian um now working at chemry how how have you felt how have you found that transition sort of moving from the veterinary field into um sort of medical research however and have you got any um suggestions for those of us here or online about talking across disciplines and making those forging those connections thank you yeah yeah that's a good question i mean i think um the first thing to say is i is i never left veterinary medicine my background is i'm a vet as you said and i think the the i have sort of um enthused colleagues at chemry and and others you know that i collaborate with globally about the value of uh animal health not just from the perspective of you know at the public you know deployment because when you think of one health there is a there's a big sort of bias i think towards thinking of control programs like a country you're deploying a control programs for brucellosis and you have to think about both but i think i've been using people to think about more even at the basic level that their difference in differences in uh animals and humans in terms of the uh immune sort of the way they mount an immune response the components of the immune response so you can understand pathogens and and how you know to con how to control pathogens uh by looking at how the host paras you know house parasite or host virus interaction differs in the different species so it's been more about showing a different way of thinking about the particular problem that uh you know colleagues are working on and applying this sort of one health um basically exploiting synergies in in uh in sort of immunology in both humans and and livestock it's not necessarily easy but it to me it just makes sense yeah no that that's wonderful and very sort of reminiscent of that original one medicine um concept and and also very great to hear that you never feel that you've left veterinary medicine i'm sorry if that was what came across i always have uh have this myself where people said oh you're in research maybe you're not a vet anymore but we're still we're still veterinarians at heart um so i'm just going to pick up on a couple of questions that came in the chat um so uh there was one question that uh suggested that given the um the prolonged drought followed by um very heavy rains that we've experienced in the country you know does this make you feel that an outbreak might be more likely and if so is there anything people should be considering to protect themselves or protect prepare yeah i mean i think that's again is a good question um there are others in the audience you know bernard bett and others who can make a really informed decision based on the sort of mathematical modeling and predictions i think i will i would emphasize more uh rather than moving rather than thinking about you know is there an outbreak that's going to happen because of these conditions i think i would emphasize being ready all the time which is something that uh jimmy mentioned in his sort of introduction introduction that we need to be ready we need to have surveillance systems that are ready to sort of uh go uh without necessarily um sort of having to wait for a set of circumstances to come to come into sort of existence so you you can always if we have surveillance systems that are full you know that are not just focused on a particular disease not just focused on rvf then you will be able to respond quickly um irregardless of whether there's a drought or whether there is not i think i would emphasize more on having um that of you know everyday sort of readiness to address sort of uh outbreaks i don't know whether i'm making sense there rather than focusing more just on an rvf outbreak yeah absolutely i think that that's really clear that we really need to put um our efforts into preparedness and surveillance um um
