 A year and a half after the devastating flash floods Pakistan faced in mid-2022 as a direct result of global climate change, a sample size of about 300 small farmers of Balochistan. Being rehabilitated using organic farming by IDSP Pakistan are now on to their third and some on their fourth crop. The plan was not just temporary relief but to rehabilitate them, put them back on their feet. So these poorest of poor farmers would become able to pay off their previous heavy interest loans, recover from flood damage and build better lives ahead for their families with their own effort, their own profits. Not only that, they would become empowered donors for the next needy farmer by donating the same quantity of seeds they received back to IDSP's seed bank from their harvest. It's the end of November 2023. Many of our farmers are harvesting the main crop of Kharif season, rice. Some lentils and vegetables are also being harvested. This is a busy time for farm labor, rented thresher machines, rented tractors, local wholesale marketplaces and happiness for farmers' families. 280 of IDSP's farmers are now planting wheat. With the assistance of NGO Choice Squad and a Rotary International Global Grant, they are now planting a Rotary International Global Grant, contributing towards this sustainable, empowering effort as the final crop to their independence.

This doesn't need further watering. Not all the seed sprouts, as water within soil is limited. 2. Plowing a harvested rice field few times, watering the canal irrigated land, and throwing the seed on it. Birds feed off much of the seed as it's exposed for a few days before sprouting. 3. Plowing a harvested rice field and inserting seed into the ground directly via spokes attached to tractor. Seed does not remain exposed to birds feeding, but new plant finds it tougher to break through the soil surface to come out after it germinates. 8.
