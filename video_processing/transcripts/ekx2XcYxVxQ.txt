 Anyway, I'm going to talk about some of the capturing and utilization of the nutrients. I'm going to talk about it a lot from the standpoint of people that have moved from open feedlots to these types of facilities. Some of the things that are different, some of the considerations that you need to make that are going to make things. Some of the big differences, with an open feedlot you can do chores probably once every six months as far as scraping and cleaning out the barns or cleaning out the pens and so forth. It needs to be very timely in these barns so it becomes part of weekly chores. Also, you are in close proximity with the cat. When you are moving in there with equipment, I take it, nobody wants to scrape these barns by hand, right? You are going to be in there with cattle. Different cattle are going to behave differently but often times they become more and more accustomed to the tractors, the equipment in there. And there is a tendency to bump them, especially late in the feeding period when you have all the money and so forth in. You have to be very, very careful and think about what you are doing. Think about the way you design these so that you can clean out the manure on a regular basis and not injure the cattle, especially when they are ready to go on the truck tomorrow. As far as the nutrients that are out there, I guess I am going to think about them in terms of where they are coming from. We have the two different types. We have the part that is coming out of the urine which is going to be mostly all our potassium, very soluble. In the open lots, a lot of times that is lost through runoff that comes off the top. We are going to be able to capture that. It does attach quickly to exchange sites so some of the soil and so forth under an open lot will have it. Otherwise, we are going to be capturing that with our bedding. Ammonia, we have done the study, it can but volatilize and often times if you are losing very much ammonia, from just your standpoint, you can smell. If you can smell it a lot, that probably means that we have got it leaving. It also will attach to the exchange sites on things. Cattle produce a lot of species or the organic matter. That part is probably always or very often going to be all captured in our facilities. That is the part that takes some additional breakdown in order for our plants to use it. It actually contains lots of exchange sites. If you have got a piece of property that you have applied manure on year after year, often times you will see that it is able to retain more. It has a higher organic matter in it. That is because that is where it came from. We take a look at how much the animals produce versus how much we are able to capture in the different systems. The reason why we get the bedded barns, we are probably going to be adding around a bale, a thousand to twelve hundred pounds of additional material out there to soak up that urine. We keep things dry. That is why we have a higher amount here in terms of the capture versus the open lot. We put things dry. On a deep pit. On a deep pit. We put things down here. And this is, I get a lot of people asking me when they have done some manure analysis, why do you have so much more captured from a deep pit? pit and it's really just a matter of how we measure it. Okay, this is measured in pounds per thousand gallons. There is, in a thousand gallons, there are four tons of material. So these are actually going to be, roughly speaking, four times as great as this because of the difference in the way that we're actually measuring. When people are building livestock facilities for cattle, one of the things, salesmen often talk about the cost per headspace on their facilities. I guess I'd like you to take a look at it in terms of cost per square foot so that you can evaluate all of these on, I'll say, the same basis. And also when we move cattle into facilities, the facilities are relatively speaking expensive. And so we squeeze more animals into less space. We're normally down in the lower end of this, I'll say at least 40 square feet per head. At 40 square feet per head, the amount of urine that you get on a daily basis is a quarter inch. Okay? That's with little cattle. That is as much as we get in terms of evaporation on the warm days. So a lot of times we're going to have them in here dense enough that you're going to keep everything wet. I put this into the paper and it's also up here. At the various stocking densities, how much depth of manure do you get in a week? And think then about how frequently you're going to scrape and get that cleaned up. Okay? And over time that I've been with Iowa State University Extension Service, we've moved from finished cattle over 900 to 1,000 head. Now I see 1,400, 1,500 pound cattle routinely being that big before they're going to market. When they're that big, they produce a lot more manure. We've done some things in terms of feeding so that we can still put on muscle on those big animals. But they're eating a lot of feed, they're gaining a lot of weight, and they're producing a lot of manure. If they're in tight, tight positions, we're looking at a lot of manure being produced. The large cattle, we're looking at over five inches per week. Okay? And if you have a cleaning schedule that's on here, the difference between the big cattle and the little cattle, and at the end of the feeding period, you need to be on it, on your schedule, or adjust your schedule so you can be on it. Because being one or two days late is the difference between having cattle that are clean and nice and are able to keep their hair cut and those that aren't. This is why we use the bedding, help soak up the manure, keep the cattle clean. Okay? Change the manure from a semi-slurry into a semi-solid that we're able to handle. Something that's at least 80% water, and that sounds like a lot, right? 20% solids, 80% water, that will stand up nicely in a manure strife. Okay? If it gets higher than that, it runs out the back gate. What are the considerations? Of course bedding has cost involved with it, and it's gotten higher over time, especially in years when you have a late wet season. When you need bedding the most, it's going to be the hardest to make, and if you can't make it, nobody else did, and it's going to be very expensive. So just put that on your thing. Every time you handle it, it costs more money. Storing it costs some money, and of course processing helps to improve the surface area, so you can soak that stuff, the urine up quickly, but of course that costs more money. Where do you want to store it? Of course you want to, often times, have it very close to the barn, and you'd like to keep it high and dry, so that you have the least amount of spoilage as possible. And here, we've got it high and dry. Now, with these, if you are slow and late, or also, I'll say, you've got to make sure that you evaluate how good the quality is of bedding, especially late in the year when we've had some decomposition of it. You might need to add a few bales so we don't end up with cattle that have lost their hair coat. If they lose the hair coat, then they're also going to have to use more of their feed to control their body temperature, especially when it gets cold. Bedding is going to change with the season, and with cattle, at least a lot of the individuals I'm working with, we're feeding calves, calves in the fall, maybe yearlings, to get another turn through there. When we bring them in in the fall, we're dealing with smaller calves, probably start them out on a little bit less hot diet, in terms of nutrients and so forth. It's normally dry. The bedding is the highest quality we're going to have each year. So that we're probably going to start out with utilizing the least amount at that time. As winter goes on, hopefully the calves are growing. The quality of the bedding is still good. We will have the occasional snow storms that come through, and big openings on our buildings will allow some of that to come in. We need to adjust and increase the amount of bedding when that happens. Spring, we're dealing now with bigger cattle. Normally, if we have some rain or so forth, the bedding is going to be wet. So part of its usefulness has already been used up. We have that thaw period and high humidity, so we're not going to get the evaporation. And we do get the frequent rains. So again, we're going to have to adjust our bedding upward. Now, the last one is summer. And I put this on here. For the people that have changed from an open feedlot to a bedded barn, they tell me that the biggest thing that was an a-ha moment in terms of it is you use more bedding in the summer than you did the fall and winter, which is the exact opposite. If you bedded in an open lot, you bedded during the winter, but you never did anything during the summer. With these facilities, to keep things moving, one, you've got great big cattle. You've got hot conditions. The cattle are drinking more. Some of the feed ingredients we have may contain some additional sodium, some additional things to cause the animals to drink more. More drinking is going to produce more urine. It needs to be soaked up. And often at the very end of the feeding period, we're dealing with heat curated bedding. It's pretty much used up. So they'll oftentimes use 50% more bedding in the summer than they do with the winter, and they did not expect that to be when they started out with the facility. So we're going to have a little bit of a deep pits. They're going to be under the slats. When you looked back to where we were in terms of how much manure you're producing, if you have an 8 to 10 foot pit, you're going to have to pump that out twice a year in order to have the storage that you need to keep the cattle in there. And I don't see anybody that's putting in a deep enough pit to make it through one year. So you're going to plan on doing that. It will tend to be more consistent. And you're going to be able to capture that and put that through. When you think about building the building with something that you're going to be in there at least weekly, probably biweekly to clean. And oftentimes with the cattle in there, we need to make sure that we've got curves so that we can scrape along the edges, make it easy to get done. Push walls for loading up that manure, maybe where we're going to place our manure spreader so we can put that all together. And then also maybe some extra mirrors on the thing so you can monitor where the cattle are. Oftentimes we're moving forward, slamming the tractor into reverse after we've loaded up a load. And oftentimes we're not looking back where those cattle, as they especially get accustomed to the equipment, might be very, very close to you and end up bumping. Here's a push wall. When I talk about push walls, this is going to be a reinforced concrete wall that you can push the loader into it and not worry about breaking anything. And when you think about the equipment that you're going to use for building, since these buildings are going to last, what, 30, 40 years? Look at the equipment that you would like to own, not the equipment that you now have. How many of you guys want to buy a smaller tractor? No hands. Oh, there's a couple hands. Somebody wants one. Anyway, so make sure you reinforce it so that you won't have the problems. And think about the individual you might hire that doesn't have any experience with the tractor that might hit the top of the push wall when he slips his foot off the clutch. Here is a nice curve along this edge. And you will be moving back and forth along there. And think about, especially when you get down into the really tight ones where there's enough room for the cattle to get back away from it. If you guys want to know how big that is, Angie's right there as our marker. As far as storage, inside the building versus out. Inside the building, of course it's going to be expensive, but it's very convenient to have some storage inside the building. You're probably not going to put it very much there, but having a couple weeks is nice. It's under roof. It's also going to be in a place where you're going to capture everything. You can also put it just outside. Nice push walls here. Also can contain it. It makes it convenient so you can get the job done even when the weather conditions are poor outside. And you need to be able to do this in all weather conditions with lawns. Okay. If we move that off site, and often times we'll have both, but move it away from the barn to the field where it's going to be utilized. It is a second place to manage. And there may be regulations and community standards. I'll just say, I get calls each year. Somebody says they don't want to smell it next to their house, so they moved it out to the field where I'm at. And even if it doesn't quote unquote, free flies, it will attract flies. And all I say is don't put it in front of the person's house. We've had that happen before. But it does help it. Normally the fields adjacent to our facilities have high nutrient contents. Those fields that are out a long ways away could really use the P and the K that we are able to capture from. Managing it, make sure that we're not losing it to the ground. Keep it high and dry. Do not stockpile in the grass waterway. And minimize the time that it's out there where we can have losses. Managing it at home is busy for us. We have many hours where we can get that landscape of grass.
