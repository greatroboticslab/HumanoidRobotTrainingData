I'm going to name drop a few folks that are influential in my life there's a guy named Jim Garrish who came to a grazing school in Watertown, South Dakota and made us repeat ten times during his session I will not be afraid to waste grass which is just a real change for us there's a man out in western Canada named Steve Kenyon who custom grazes cattle for folks he has some of his own herd he's got sheep now but he said when people say it takes a thousand years to add an inch of topsoil I can increase topsoil by an inch in seven years through integrating cattle those people get me excited and that's why I enjoy what we're doing and it's just a whole bunch of fun to have Eli agree with me and get excited about it too I got sold from Gabe Brown when Barry had listened to him before I had and you know I think it was about January 2018 when I saw him at a soil health coalition conference and listening to him talk about what he does it's a goal it's a goal it's great because we know now we have so many things we could accomplish on our farm it's just we're always building on it but when he said that he would bet his farm against anyone's farm that what he does would work on their farm I took that as a challenge to prove him right instead of a challenge to prove him wrong because why wouldn't you want to be doing what he's doing and the biggest thing for us I think was the context part you you can fail easily at anything if you try but if you look at your context and you and you study what your climate is how things will fit into your system you can make soil health work on every acre anywhere we've lost acres and added acres in the last 10 years we added we added a few quarters of heavy soil in this area and we added another quarter or two of just some really light soil and it's our approach is the same it's you know what can we do with soil health on those acres and we know it's going to work if we just stick to the principles and and look at our our context of all that you know when we did look at our context we were thinking okay we like the cover crops we want we want more cover crops we want we want to be able to plant as many species as possible every year and so we were we were doing spring wheat for small grain and we realized that we didn't have enough growing season to to get the cover crop growth after spring wheat so one thing we we did was we started planting a lot more winter wheat we were doing a lot of oats this year just knowing that we can get that crop off earlier and get a cover crop going you know we did 17 species this year because we know how many pounds an acre of each thing we can add so one of the things we did is converted cropland to pasture and that was a learning experience but it worked out very well for us and and now we're transitioning that field back into cropland because we can I guess we never want to give up the experiments because every conference we go to we hear something new that we just got to try on this farm and I I guess at this point I need to say that without the South Dakota grassland coalition and the South Dakota soil health coalition we probably wouldn't have gotten access to an awful lot of excellent material that we've assimilated and I appreciate the folks that are willing to go to a conference stand up in front of a crowd and explain to us what they've been doing so we're going to work on staying on this land as long as possible and you know we've got the river bottom land we know none of its native because sand was really easy to plow and so we need to work on on that land we know that the previous practices on it had depleted it what it was before that is what we need to get back to what the you know the migrating buffalo did to it we need to replicate that and work with that and we know it'll be beneficial and it'll make the land more valuable and it'll keep my family here our family here for generations for generations
