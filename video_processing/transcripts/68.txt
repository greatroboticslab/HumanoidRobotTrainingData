 Hey everybody, Chris here from New Jersey 101.5 and NJ1015.com and today I'm going to show you the proper way to plant a tomato in New Jersey. So here I have a nice heirloom variety yellow brandy wine. And what you want to do is, first of all, it's May 16th so you want to wait until at least May 15th, the last day, the last frost date in New Jersey. If you plant them earlier, they're just going to be stressed out so don't even bother. Until the 15th and then you want to find one that is pretty big because there's a trick to this. Tomatoes have this interesting property and I don't know if you can come in here where any part of the plant that touches soil is going to start growing roots. So what you do, and you have to kind of be brave here, is pull all the leaves off on the bottom part of the tomato, the stems, and just leave the top set. And then you can come in a little closer here and we'll just show you. You know these roots are all balled up and becoming root bound. So just pull the bottom of that, spread them apart a little bit, and now you're going to encourage it to grow all these big roots. So we dug a nice deep hole and we're going to try to plant all of that down. So all this is going to become roots. A cool thing to do to help the tomatoes is to save some of your eggshells. And what you're going to do is just break up the eggshells into the hole. So about a half an egg or an egg per hole. Just real quick to get this last set in there. And it's okay if they kind of break up or whatever because the plant will kind of take its time to grow. But then once those new roots establish, it's just going to spread out so far in the soil. You're going to get so much more nutrients and you're going to get so many more tomatoes and they're just going to be that much better, bigger, tastier. So go ahead, push that soil back in. Don't be scared to push down. And get rid of the excess leaves. Just the top is there. Push your straw back in. Use straw, don't use wood mulch. Wood mulch will rob the nutrients of the tomato plant. Go ahead and go like that and give it a little drink. Set the base. There's no need to get the leaves wet. Just like that the water will settle. And as you water it, you're going to do one good soaking a week. Maybe a little bit more as it's getting established. But it's going to encourage the roots to grow down and out into New Jersey soil. So hope that works for you. You know, if you're not brave enough, do one and see what you think this year. And let me know in the comments below or if you have any other tricks. If you want to learn more about why you do this, you can check the post. And there's a link for that in the description. So thanks so much for watching. And I'm Chris from New Jersey 101.5.
