 hey guys this is Adam with farm life outfitters and I just want to jump on here today and and talk to you a little bit about our cows we purchased our first cows this year so this is year one with with them and we've learned a lot we have enjoyed them I just I love having the cows they're they're easy to manage they they're just a pleasure to be around the only con is that they eat a lot they do require quite a bit of feed compared to what we've had in the past with our sheep and goats so I had to buy quite a bit of hay this year and they require a lot of pasture so I want to talk to you about a little experiment that I'm doing right now with managed grazing compared to continuous grazing so here we go all right so from about September I don't know early September through October we did not have much rain at all and so I I kept our cows over here close to the house and fed them hay during that time to keep them off the pasture so over here one of our pastures is approximately five acres and it looks something like this I think you guys saw me splitting this up into paddocks earlier in the year so it looks something like this and then we have a divider that looks something like that so we separated the the entire pasture into two two pastures basically so the total total is about five acres for this entire plot so from the end of August till November there were there were no animals on this pasture which allowed the grass to regrow and before I took the cows over I mean it was probably a foot tall in some places or maybe more in the grass so on November the 10th I moved the cows over here and and I was setting up a daily rotation which looks like this so every day I will set this up these three wires get set up every day so they're here on day one then they move here and then this wire gets moved to here so the next day they move to here and so on and so on so I've calculated that by keeping this these paddocks tight I've got a 50 days worth of grazing in this in this five acres I am new to this I'm new to having cows I'm still figuring out how to move them what to do and we also I forgot to tell you how many we have so we have six cows we have three calves and one bull and one bull so I've calculated that this five acres will last 50 days by moving them every day from paddock to paddock on the other hand and this is the part of the experiment that I'm sort of guessing at I mean I can I can look at the pasture and kind of tell how long it might last so I have estimated that I'm going to have a lot of so I have estimated that if I were to turn the cows out into this five acres with no divisions just let them have the entire five acres my estimation would be that it would last two weeks so continuous grazing would last two weeks so that would mean out of the 50 days they would be here I would have to feed hay for five weeks so that would be nine rolls and from having them close to the house and feeding them hay I have found that they will go through a roll of hay in three to four days so let's just say every four days we need a roll of hay so that would be nine rolls that would be a cost of three hundred and fifteen dollars for continuous grazing that's two weeks with no hay and five weeks of feeding hay and feeding out nine rolls of hay during that time let's compare that to managed intensive grazing by moving them every day and giving them just enough for that day all right so I am uh like I said I'm moving the cows but I'm also giving them some hay and I found that for let's just call it managed intensive grazing MIG one roll of hay will last two weeks and that's giving them just enough every day just to make sure they get enough to eat and uh so one roll will last two weeks so that means in 50 days I will have fed out three and a half rolls of hay times 35 dollars is 125 dollars that's the cost of feeding the cows during this 50 days so we have uh 315 dollars for continuous grazing minus the 125 dollars is a balance of so we have a hundred and ninety dollars savings for uh moving the cows every day so after I figured that I wanted to see how much like you know it takes time to move these cows so it takes me on average 20 minutes per day so that's every morning I go and I give the cows a little bit of hay which takes about 10 minutes and then every afternoon I go and move the cows to the next paddock which takes about 10 minutes so on average I spend 20 minutes a day feeding and moving the cows so at 20 minutes a day that is 16 and a half hours roughly during this 50 day pasture rotation I've got 16 and a half hours labor in moving the cows so then we do 190 dollars divided by 16 and a half hours so I make uh 11.50 an hour to go move the cows so to me that's worth it that's worth it not only am I saving money to go move the cows it's also benefiting the land by moving the cows I've noticed that I'm spreading the fertility where I want it because if if they were continuous grazing over this whole pasture they would pick a spot let's say there's a tree here there's a tree here that you know they would pick these spots that they would lounge every day and that's where most of the manure would be deposited and that's where the fertility would would go but by moving them every day this whole paddock right here is covered with manure and then the next day this whole paddock is just covered in manure so on and so on so I am spreading out my fertility over the whole pasture instead of concentrating it in this one area where they like to lounge every day another benefit that I've noticed even though we're in fall winter and the temperatures are pretty cold you know we're we've gotten down into the 20s but most days it's lows in the 30s and highs in the 60s so I've noticed that by the time I get here which is this is about three weeks this grass back here has already grown back some so once I keep on going around I can come back again and make the paddock a little bigger you know maybe make this area their paddock for the day or I can just give them the whole pasture at that point but I think what I'm going to do since the grass is regrowing a little bit is just give them a slightly bigger paddock and then just keep going around and so instead of 50 paddocks I might have 20 so one you know just have 20 paddocks going around so thank you for joining me today on this little experiment that I'm doing with the cows like I said I really enjoy the cows I like to see what they're doing to the land and I'm excited to see just the benefit of having the cows on the land and and how much better our pastures are going to be I hope you guys have a great day and we'll see you on the next one I hope you guys have a great day now and I know that it's embarrassing for our pastures this is Billis here for theæ¯› as it is Thank you.
