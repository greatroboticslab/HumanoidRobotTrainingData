Education
 Hello folks and welcome to today's webinar on farm composting fundamentals with Dr. Robert Rink. I'm Linda Bilsons-Brolis of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance's Composting for Community Initiative and will be your hosts for this webinar series. A quick shout out to a couple of my ILSR colleagues who are helping with the series. Sophia Jones will be providing technical support throughout this webinar and Clarissa Libertelli is a talented artist who is creating beautiful graphics for our composting initiative including this image. So thank you for both. Thank you both for your help. For those of you that aren't familiar with our work ILSR's Composting for Community Initiative is advancing composting to reduce waste, enhance local soils, create community development opportunities, and protect the climate. Our focus is to catalyze distributed food waste composting options that include home, community, and on-farm scales. We work to promote locally based composting in a number of different ways. We convene a national community composter coalition and host networking and knowledge sharing opportunities such as our cultivating community composting forums. We work one-on-one with communities through technical assistance and policy support. We produce reports and infographics. We host regular webinars and a podcast as well as a map that showcases initiatives around the country and policies and programs that are advancing composting at this scale. We also offer technical training through our Neighborhood Soil Rebuilders Composter Training Program and for anyone that's interested in more training we'll be releasing a self-paced online community composting 101 course later this fall. This course covers composting fundamentals, and the ins and outs of starting a community-based composting initiative so stay tuned. You can find all of these resources and more on our website. If you go to ilsr.org forward slash composting you'll see a composting resources drop down menu on the right hand side of the screen and from there you can select reports, podcasts, webinars, and more. So back to this webinar series. This series is being brought to you through our involvement with the Million Acre Challenge which you'll be hearing more about in a moment. But our belief is that we can only achieve a regenerative food system if the nutrients from our food scraps and other organic materials are cycled back into our soils and farmers and other folks that care for the soil are ideal stewards of this process. There are many other benefits of composting and compost use which is exactly what the series will explore. As you can see here this is the first of the series in which Dr. Robert Rink will cover the variety of methods and key considerations for establishing a composting site on a farm. Next up on September 14th we'll hear from Ellen Palyshuk who was a farmer at Potomac Vegetable Farms in Virginia for 25 years. She'll discuss integrating composting into your farming business and how to use it as a tool for profit and growth. Check out the rest of the lineup here and on our website. Now let's get to know each other a little bit with some interactive polls. So you'll be able to participate in the poll by going to the GoToWebinar control panel. It should be on your screen. So first question, where are you participating from? Northeastern U.S., Southern U.S., Midwestern U.S., Western U.S., or outside of the U.S. Give you all just a few more seconds. All right, let's see the results. So primarily Northeastern U.S. got a pretty good spread, even a few folks from outside of the U.S. So thanks for joining us. Next question. Are you composting? Yes, you're already composting. No, but you're interested in starting. No, you're interested in supporting others in composting or other. All right, just a couple more seconds. So large majority are already composting. Awesome. Welcome. Hopefully we'll be providing you some great info to improve your composting. And for those of you that have not started yet, hopefully we'll be giving you some inspiration to do so. Last question for now. What best describes your affiliation? And I'm sorry, they only give you five options. So I had to condense some of the options. But are you a farmer, a composter, a farm service provider, and then either a researcher, government, or nonprofit person, or other business, or other? All right, just a couple more seconds. All right, let's check out the results. So a good chunk are farmers. Welcome. But there's also a lot of either underwaterInst 있다는 control panel who's roots developing for YEISH, anar trying to I would love to hand things over to my colleague at the Million Acre Challenge, Amanda Cather, who is the project director of the Million Acre Challenge. So Amanda, if you're on the line, you can unmute yourself. Okay, can you hear me? Yes, we can. Okay, thank you, Linda, very much. Yes, as Linda said, my name is Amanda Cather, and I'm the project director for the Million Acre Challenge. We are a collaborative project of six founding partners and many more collaborators and farmers working to bring 1 million acres of healthy soils to the Chesapeake region and to help catalyze the national movement towards regenerative agriculture. And we are very grateful to be able to help sponsor this workshop series with ILSR, who is one of those six founding partners. We at the Million Acre Challenge work towards regenerative agriculture using a combination of five levers, which are represented in our five working groups, and you can see them here on this slide. Farmer engagement, scientific research, creating a business case for regeneration, working on state and local policy, and also participating in national discussions about state and local policy, and creating consumer demand for regenerative agriculture via public outreach. So, and of course, as all of you know, because you're here today, on-farm composting is deeply important and woven through all of these layers and these working groups with the potential to increase farm profitability, provide significant ecosystem services, including potentially reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and contribute to farm resilience in the face of a changing climate, which we feel every single day, at least on my farm. So, as you all know, composting, this is our mission and our vision for the Million Acre Challenge. And composting is both critically important to this mission and vision, and also scientifically and technically complex, which is why the Million Acre Challenge partners are so excited to be a part of the series, bringing together regional and national experts on on-farm composting. I would encourage you to find out more about the Million Acre Challenge on the web at millionacrechallenge.org or on our social media feeds. We'd love to connect with all of you. But for now, I think we should get on with what you came for. Oh, these are our team, our six founding partners, and we're grateful to all of them for their support today and always. And yeah, let's get on with the webinar. Awesome. Thanks, Amanda. All right. So, before we begin our future presentation, just a few housekeeping notes, everyone is in listen-only mode. We should have about 20 or so minutes at the end of the webinar for questions, but go ahead and enter your questions as they come up into the GoToWebinar control panel box on your screen. We'll be monitoring them there. This webinar is being recorded, and a copy will be sent to you as a registrant of the webinar. And there's also a handout of the presentation available as an attachment. If you are a farmer who was not, who could not find the discount code and ended up paying for the webinar, please let us know either in the chat here or by emailing us, and we will get you refunded. So just let us know. But without further ado, it is my pleasure to introduce our speaker. Dr. Robert Rink has been researching and teaching about processing of agricultural and other organic materials for over 30 years. He's an internationally renowned expert who has authored numerous publications, including the original on-farm composting handbook and its pending sequel, The Composting Handbook. He's an agricultural engineer and is a regular instructor for composting training schools and workshops, both nationally and internationally. So without further ado, take it away, Dr. Rink. Dr. Robert Rink Oh, thank you, Linda. Let me share my webcam briefly. I know you don't want to look at me the whole time, but that's what I look like. I just wanted to show you that I'm here. I'm not a robot, or chicken, or Linda changing her voice. I'm very happy to be here. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about on-farm composting because I think it's important. So let me get rid of myself and start showing you my slides, which are a great deal more interesting. Okay, get started there. Can everybody see that? Can you hear me, Linda? Linda Rink Yep. Looks good. Sounds good. Dr. Robert Rink Okay, great. Thanks. So I'm going to talk about the fundamentals of on-farm composting and composting generally. We have an hour. That's not a lot of time to cover the waterfront. So I'm going to do this more or less as best as I can. I took a look at your questions that you put in ahead of time. I think that I will answer a bunch of those and some I will only touch upon. And then others, you'll have to wait for the other webinar speakers who will address them in a bit more detail. So I'll be glad to answer questions at the end to get into more detail as needed. Okay, so what am I going to be talking about today? Why on-farm composting matters. I'll give a brief overview of the process and mostly by example of what other farms have done, show you the methods and equipments involved in composting. Again, it's just a sampling given the time we have. We'll talk about site requirements and environmental factors, but here's where the more or less comes in. I'll be spending more time on the methods and equipment than I will be on site requirements and environmental factors. Okay. What I won't be talking about in much depth at all is composting farm mortalities or vermicomposting on farm. Community-based composting and the compost, how to use it, how to make the quality you want, how to sell it, and won't be getting much into economics. But again, I'll be glad to answer questions at the end. And in general, details and specifics will be missing because of the time. But if you're interested in at least three of those topics, composting animal mortalities, community-scale composting and vermicomposting, there are some great references out there for you to gain more information. The one in the upper left-hand side is available online from the Cornell Waste Management Institute. I think it's free. And the other two are books, well worth the investment. And you'll be hearing from James McSweeney later on in the program. And then, of course, this has been my big project. It's taking the on-farm composting handbook, expanding it and updating it, and creating a new handbook. And this is just about done. The chapters are with the publisher. They think they could get it out by the end of the year. Let's have our fingers crossed, especially before Christmas. I'm sure would make a great Christmas gift. And that's the introduction. So what does composting do? In a nutshell, basically composting takes raw feedstocks like this and many other types of feedstocks. These happen to be culled potatoes from a farm in Central Washington and turns it into this. From something that's difficult to handle, doesn't have an immediate use, to something that's a lot more, that's easier to handle and does have a good use. So this compost being spread here was made from these very same, well not the very same, but made from culled potatoes also and other packing shed calls, along with dairy manure, to become an input for this particular farm. So why does on-farm composting matter? Well, basically because composting and compost matter. They play important roles, not only in agriculture, but in society general. And composting and compost on farms is a lot more. So it's not a lot more. So farms are an excellent place for both. So if we can take, do a lot of the composting on farms, and farms can accept a lot of the compost that's made. We are solving a great number of problems. So on-farm composting matters a lot because composting composting matters. The first reason, probably the most important reason, that composting matters is that is the compost, which can greatly improve soils and improve plant health. Again, you're going to get a another webinar presentation on this, so I'm not going to go in any depth. But in a picture, this is what composting does for the soil. And in words, from the same, from Dr. Gamm, these are some of the benefits of compost to soils and plants. Particularly on farms, composting also has a place in manure management. Increasingly, farmers have some difficulty handling manures. As animal numbers increase and land doesn't necessarily increase along with it, it's easy to get in a situation where there's too many nutrients for the farm. Manure can be difficult to handle. It has more volume, more weight, more water than compost, and that could equate to more trips to distant fields to apply it in an agronomic manner. Whereas compost stores well, it doesn't have to be applied right away. And it's exportable. And it's exportable because it handles easily and therefore more people want it, and more people willing to take it from the farm, and even people willing to pay for it. So potentially, depending upon the farm situation, compost can be a benefit from the manure management. Okay, and then there's the potential for added revenue for the farm. Okay. Revenue could come from making compost by selling the compost that's made, or by being paid to take waste and residues from off the farm. Okay. So this picture shows both. This is not a farm. This is a company that takes advantage of both of those revenues. And so compost, they charge to bring in green waste. In farm situation, that could be difficult. In some jurisdictions, if you do either of these on the farm, that is, sell compost made from waste from off the farm, or sell compost at all, or taking off farm waste, that jurisdiction may say, well, you're no longer a farm. That's not always the case. It depends upon the state in particular. In some cases, you can do both and still retain your farm classification. In other cases, you could do one or the other, but not both. And that's usually the common case. So you can sell compost from feedstocks that you collect on the farm, or even off farm feedstocks, and you're still at farm. Or you can bring in green waste, but not sell the compost, and you'd be still at farm. Usually, it's the bringing in off farm materials that's a little more allowed, and where the revenues are more easily captured in this case. It takes a pretty good effort sometimes to sell. And bringing in off farm waste, there are a lot of people who might be looking for a home for their waste and residues, and farms are a good place to bring it. It just brings some cautions. One of the reasons that route is a little easier is because we recognize that it's not so easy to get rid of waste anymore, particularly organic waste. Don't want to put them in landfill. And a good number of states, this slide's from my colleague, Matt Cotton, a good number of states starting 40 years ago started banning art trimmings from landfills. That's when we had a landfill crisis. And more recently, a number of states are beginning to ban ban food waste. They'll call it organic, organics generally. New York State being the most recent to implement a statewide ban for food waste. And that presents opportunities for farmers to take in these materials and get paid to do that. So, you know, food is a new trend. And it's because of its impact on climate change. So when food is brought to the landfill, even with a landfill with a methane collection system, it still makes methane and that methane escapes. And that's because food breaks down so quickly at the landfill base. It emits its methane before methane collection system has a chance to start collecting. And methane is a potent greenhouse. And thirdly, there's better options than the landfill. First being trying to make use of it as food for people and then food for animals and then finally it could be composted or sent to an analytic digestion facility. But all of those are better than the landfill. So the push to start taking food waste out of the landfill though is mostly due to climate change. And then compost has some benefits as far as carbon sequestration to the climate change thing. This slide is from Jeff Break. I think I saw Jeff's name on the list. So this is where compost has been used on rangeland or pasture in Marin County in California. And the researchers shown some pretty good benefits. So here's just an example. Well, let me go back to the previous slide. The squares indicate where cows are grazing on this land that they've received compost. And they seem to be preferentially grazing on those plots where compost was used versus the rest of the pasture land where there was no compost used. But more directly, this is a slide of the soil organic matter several years after a single application of compost was made. So the red bars are the plots that had compost. And you can see they generally show fire soil organic matter compared to control plots that didn't receive compost. But the big story here is that this is not an annual application of compost that the soil organic matter is responding to, but a single application that happened in 2008. So that one application has many years of India and this project is still going on. So sticking with the climate change theme, another colleague of mine, Jane Gilbert led a team that looked, that tried to put a number on the carbon sequestration value of compost alone. It's available in this publication from the ISWA. Again, I think that's free. And they placed a value on it just for carbon sequestration of five to nine dollars per fresh ton of compost. That's of the compost and not of the waste, meaning it's not a dry ton of compost. There's some value there. So all good. There's some value there. Great. I'm fine composting. Great. What's the downside? Well, it takes work. It takes work. It takes time. You got to put money in. You need space to do it. Investment in equipment, investment in land, maybe investment in controls. So it's not free. And the hope is that it'll pay for itself either in the value of the compost or the service you provide, but it does take an effort. And then there are also the hassles related to mostly odors. Okay. So this is a sign that came across where a compost was trying to expand a farm composter into new land. And there was lots of neighborhood opposition to that, mostly because there had been odor issues before. So composting isn't welcomed by everyone. It's generally welcomed by everyone until it comes to your neighborhood. And then there's an issue. These things are controllable. I shouldn't say controllable. These things can be made better by a number of practices that composters can do, including becoming more active and participating in the neighborhood. But this is one of the things that any composter may face, even on a farm. But the sign's wrong. The sign should say this. Say yes, composting. And it is farming. It's very compatible with farming. It's consistent with farming. In fact, I would even argue that composting is inherently farming by its nature, because you're using natural processes to produce a product. And your husbanding microorganisms to do that. And it's a radical idea. But I would suggest, yes, if you're composting, you're automatically farming. So that's the why. Let's look at the how, the composting process. Part of the how. I'm going to go through this fairly quickly, because a lot of you are composter already. I know much of this. These are the ins and outs of the composting process. The direction of the arrow show whether it's an in or out. Basically, what we put in are the feedstocks. The microorganisms are there, although some people add special microorganisms to do that. The oxygen comes in on its own. Although, again, in some cases, they have to make an effort to do that. And the water as well. And the outputs are water vapor, carbon dioxide, and heat, all good things. And then there are some bad things, odors and other gases that people might object to. But the main output is compost, which is a value added product of the feedstocks that go in. And here's the trend of a composting process. Okay. Many of you have seen this graph or something like it. Temperature tells the story of what's going on during compost. And temperature does that by the fact that it's a direct result of the decomposition that's taking place of the microbial's action. So as heat is released from the decomposition, the temperature goes up and accumulates and heats up the pile. And it basically reflects how much heat is being generated. Okay. So there's several stages. There's this accelerating stage in the beginning, beginning when temperature heats up quickly. This long stage, hot, rapid composting, where we spend most of our time. And then a final stage where compost cures and matures. And that's reflected by the lower temperatures that's going on. There's a few other temperatures to take note of. One is the point at which a mesophilic process turns into a thermophilic process. This is not a very important point. It's just an academic matter really. And it's not a fixed point anyway. The microorganisms themselves don't see this line and don't know where it happens. It's just that thermophilic microorganisms can stand higher temperatures and they do most of the work for most of the composting process. And mesophilic microorganisms don't. They can play different roles. So mesophilic, for example, mesophilic microorganisms are more active in that curing and curing stage. And their mesophilic, some mesophilic organisms are the ones that turn ammonia into nitrate and nitrate. So that transformation happens in that. But basically we're in a thermophilic. A more important line is this one. And that's the pathogen threshold. Or at least that's the pathogen, the standard pathogen threshold. Regulations often dictate that pathogens and wheat seeds have to be killed. Depending upon the peat stocks and the situation, you have to make sure you follow pathogen reduction process. And in the US, we call that process to further reduce pathogens, PFRP. Outside of the US, we may just call it sanitization or or homogenization. But it generally happens, it's generally defined at this 55 degrees Celsius or 100, which is 101 degrees Fahrenheit at this point. So normally the regulations say when they apply is that you have to hold the composting materials above that temperature for a certain amount of time. So for static processes and processes that are contained in the vessel, that's 55 degrees C for three days. For windrows, which are smaller, have a larger surface area and they get turned, it's actually 15 degrees. And it has to be turned five times within that time span, within that 15 degree time span. Or it has to be turned five times. And during the five times, it stays above 55 degrees. Now, outside of the US, some regulations require, have raised this pathogen threshold to 60 degrees and even 65 degrees in some places, which can be a challenge depending upon the feed cell. But basically it's 55. So that's an important one. And that's also where wheat seeds are killed. And actually most wheat seeds are killed below, well below 55, 131, even at 120 degrees Fahrenheit, most wheat seeds can die. But if you want to be sure, the higher the temperature, the better. And keeping the pile moist during those hot temperatures also helps to destroy some of these seeds. Okay. Just as a clarification, those dips on this curve really represent when the pile may be turned or watered. It's an immediate loss of temperature, but it recovers. Okay. And then there's a securing stage at the end where the process continues. It's become decomposition is still going on, but it's at a much slower pace. So this curing pile doesn't require the same attention or effort as the active composting stage. It's an important stage. A lot of things happen, in the curing. Temperatures lower. Again, those mesophilic organisms. Fungi begin to come back, uh, in greater numbers during curing, and continue, uh, turning this partially composted material into compost. So it's an important stage. But it's requires less attention and actually less time as well. So here are some of the key factors that determine how well composting occurs. It needs to be moist. The organisms live in the moisture within the compost pile and 50 to 60 percent moisture content seems to be the optimal. It has to have a good mix of nutrients, particularly carbon and nitrogen. I recommend higher carbon nitrogen ratios than most people do. Go by the book. We're talking about 25 to one or slightly larger. I like to say more because the more higher the carbon nitrogen ratio is, the better that a pile of the windrow tends to airy. And also, it slows down the process a bit. As the carbon nitrogen ratio raises above 25 to one, the process slows down. If you're in a hurry, that's not good. But if you're not in a hurry and want a little more leeway to manage the process properly, having a higher seed end ratio is bad. However, the downside of high seed end ratios is that carries over into the compost, making the compost. That's the degradation. And that does have some. Bulk density refers to the weight per unit volume. But it turns out the bulk density is a pretty good indicator of the process conditions generally, both the moisture condition and how well, how much pore space there is, open pore space there is. And so it's a good indicator of how well a pile will air rate, whether you're using fans or passive aeration and should stay below 100, 1000 pounds per feet. And temperatures, again, try to stay in that ideal range above where the pathogens are killed, but below where the microorganisms seem to suffer. And that seems to be about 100. Okay, there's some other parameters that are important, but they're not as important in terms of control, what we do. Oxygen is clearly important, but in most cases, composters do not spend a lot of time measuring it on the use temperature as an indirect gauge instead. So let's take a look a little bit more at each one of these. Again, there's a range where moisture content is just right. You get a little higher. It's too wet. Materials get heavy. Boards get filled with water. It can't airate. And then a point where the process slows down because there's not enough water for the microorganisms to inhabit. So that sweet spot is above 50, below 65. You get below 35, way too dry. Nothing will happen. And it hurts. So the challenge in composting is, depending upon where you're composting, where you are, is keeping it moist. In average regions, this is a constant struggle because it's not easy to add moisture evenly throughout a pile. A good way to do it is to add moisture while you're turning. But that means you've got to carry water along with you as you're doing the turn. So keeping it moist is important. Keeping it dry, keeping it from getting too moist is also important. So here's pictures of these fabric covers that are used to keep out precipitation. This is not necessarily the only way, but it's a good picture of an attempt to keep it from getting too moist. Really the best way or the most common way is to turn it to try to drive off some of that moisture, especially on the sunny day. But in some places, keeping it from getting too dry is the challenge. In other places, keeping it from getting too moist. Oxygen really is the key to composting. That's what we want, aerobic, oxygen-rich conditions in the pile because we want aerobic microorganisms to do the work because those are the ones who do it most quickly, most completely, and with the least amount of odors. 5% is considered a minimum. That's a bare minimum, but generally the goal is to try to keep it above that. And normally we don't monitor room oxygen. Again, let temperature tell the story. And then we just aerate as best we can. And oxygen is delivered to the pile by aeration. And there's two primary ways of aeration. Windrows and passive piles are aerate by passive aeration. Basically what's happening is inside the pile it's a little warmer than it is in the environment around and that warm air leaves the pile. And then it creates a vacuum and cool air, cool oxygen-rich air replaces it. Diffusion is another way that oxygen gets in and CO2 gets out of the pile, but diffusion is a very slow process. Relying on that doesn't provide nearly as much air and oxygen as these passive air movements. And these passive air movements are very dependent on, first of all, generating temperatures inside, warmer temperatures inside, but also how easy the air can move in and out. And that has to do with the air space within the pile, bulk density. We can air it with more certainty by putting a fan and some ductwork within the pile. Using pressure to blow air into the middle of it and then hopefully it's distributed evenly and the cool, fresh, oxygen-rich air goes in the middle, cools the pile, keeps it from getting too hot and also brings in oxygen. The primary way of using forest aeration, especially on farms, is a method called the air-rated static pile method. This would be a diagram of that. Air-rated static piles do not get turned on a regular basis. They may get turned occasionally, once or twice, and the aeration system has to be taken out, disassembled and reassembled when returning, or it's built into a floor and you can turn on top of that. But this is a picture of the air-rated static. We'd also suck air out of the pile, change the direction of these arrows. That would be used when a little bit more concerned about odors because you concentrate the exhaust from the pile at one point and that would be directed to an over-treatment system like the file. But positive pressure systems like the one showing here are generally easier to handle. They use less energy and they are the most common. I'll show you some pictures of these later. Okay, so I haven't talked about turning yet in regard to aeration. So what does turning do? Well, it doesn't really aerate it, at least not in the long term. Here are the functions of turning. It does charge the pile with fresh air and oxygen. That oxygen lasts really briefly, an hour, maybe two hours at best. So turning does not really provide aeration. What it does is it releases the gases that are trapped inside, mixes things up so it redistributes nutrients and moisture, it breaks up air channels, it improves consistency. So you'll see, in some cases it does flow. So it reduces the density of the material in the windrow, making it easier for air to flow in and out by passive aeration. But in other cases, it doesn't. In other cases, it shreds particles apart and after turning, you end up with a windrow that's less dense. Then it depends on the situation and turning breaks apart. So that's primarily what it does. And because of that, generally invigorates the process. Always see a burst of activity. Part of it's that oxygen that it builds in for a short time, but a lot of it are those others, mixing and churning. I kind of compare it to making a stir fry on the stove and you're actually doing the stirring, distribute things around the pan a little bit more and make things more even. That's returning. You can envision what's going on within the composting pile at a microscopic level, and it might look something like this. You've got these particles of biodegradable organic materials. They're breaking down and this moisture film kind of clings to the edge of it. That's where the microorganisms are in that moisture. And they're breaking down the particle from its surfaces outward and the nutrients tend to dissolve into that moisture film and the microorganisms gain the nutrients on the moisture. So, where's the oxygen? Well, immediately most of the oxygen is in those pore spaces that you're seeing on the lab. And it has to actually, it has to diffuse into the moisture film to get to the microorganisms. So, it's important to remain, to maintain a pile that has those pore spaces, we call them free air spaces, because they're not filled with moisture. So, we want to avoid the situation on the right as much as possible where the particles are clumped together. There's no free air space and no, and it's more difficult for oxygen to diffuse into that moisture. So, we want to encourage the left-hand side of this diagram rather than that. And what determines that in part is the bulk density. Bulk density reflects whether we have these particles all packed together without free air space and a lot of moisture or whether it's fluffier. And so, we shoot for a bulk density and that's 700 to 1000 pounds per cubic yard area. And it's pretty easy to measure bulk density. All you need is a pail on the scale. There's a standard method of doing this by filling a pail a certain amount and dropping it from a certain height. Keep filling a pail and keep dropping it until you get to a certain point. And then you weigh it and you've got the weight for a five gallon pail and you convert that to a cubic yard. So, it's easy to do. The reason I show this slide is because bulk density is an easy and very general measure to determine the conditions in the pail and it's a good one. Pile height is often the question, what's the right height for a pile? I like to measure pile heights in calvins. This is calvin you see in the picture. So, this pile is maybe two calvins high. The reason I measure in calvins is because to me feet is a bit too improvised when talking about pile height. What's the difference between a three foot high or four foot high pile or even six and eight foot high pile? Not much. So, I like to refer to pile heights in calvins. And so, in general, maybe three calvins is a max. And if you want to do the conversion, calvins is about six foot tall. That's the point. We don't need to be too precise. As one of my colleagues says, there's really no decimal points in concrete. But in regard to windrow size, maybe the best rule of thumb to go by is you have to drive onto a pile to get it to the top to stack it, then it's too big. But generally, the pile sizes are determined by the equipment you're going to be used to make the piles. If you're using windrow turners, the windrow turners are going to dictate the pile. But if you're using loaders, you can go a lot higher. And so, this rule of thumb of not driving on the pile to determine the pile height. Next factor is feedstocks. Feedstock brings all of its character to the compost pile. And basically, feedstocks are what determine how the composting process is going to go, how it's going to behave. And feedstocks primarily determine the character of the compost itself. So, if you have nutrient-rich feedstocks, you'll make nutrient-rich compost. If you have nutrient-poor feedstocks, you'll make nutrient-poor compost. Woody feedstocks make woody compost. You get it. And feedstocks with contaminants will make compost. You can do things to improve that. Really, it's the feedstocks that determine. Sometimes you get feedstocks that are adequately balanced. They'll compost without doing anything, like these art trimmings on the right. Sometimes not, like this manure in the bottom left. That needs some amending before it'll compost go. And so, what we do is we mix ingredients together. Ingredients that don't have enough nitrogen, ingredients that have too much nitrogen, ingredients that are wet, with ingredients that are dry to try to get these conditions that I talked about earlier. And brush and leaves and grass and food are good examples. In the backyard composting world, we talk about these low nitrogen materials as browns, and these high nitrogen materials as greens. And the high nitrogen materials most often are wet. Not always, but most often are wet. And the low nitrogen materials most often are dry. Combining them together with the right seed end ratio also tends to improve the moisture status. Here's an example of a composting recipe on a farm using fish waste. James McQueen is going to talk about this a lot more, so I'm not going to go into it. There's some examples of nitrogen-rich feedstocks, poultry manure, fish waste, food, grass. And you want to combine those with nitrogen-poor feedstocks like fall leaves, straw, horse bedding, brush, things of that nature. I crossed out carbon and put in nitrogen-poor because we often refer to things as carbon sources, but really carbons in everything, even in the nitrogen, high nitrogen materials, everything, all organic material has roughly the same amount of carbon. It's the nitrogen that determines whether it's a carbon source or not, really. Okay, the next factor is temperature. Talked a lot about that already. There's temperature range that's ideal for composting. It tends to be between 120 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, but at 160 it doesn't suffer much. Above 160 it starts to suffer more. But we want to get to that 130 level to kill pathogens and wheat seeds. Okay. The thing about temperature, the most important thing about temperature, the composting process is that we can consider temperature composting thermometer. Talked about this already. The release of heat is the direct result of the process. So watching the temperature reflects the release of heat and the microbial activity. So it's the most important parameter to monitor to tell us what's going on. And then time is the last step. It takes some time. You can't really rush the microorganism too much. Usually we need at least about a month to make stable compost for general use. More often it takes two to six months. And if you're relaxed about it or have tough feedstocks, it could take a year or more. It depends on the feedstocks, how you intend to use the compost and how stability, stable it needs to be when you're using it. The methods. The methods. And it's really the management. Once you determine, it's the management more so than the method that determines whether you're not going to use it. And then you watch all these things to make sure it's going. And the sensory observations of food to produce. Okay. Let's move on to equipment and methods. I'm going to use examples to go over different farm scale composting. So the most common is turned windrows. And that's what you'll see the most pictures of. And that's probably what you have in your mind when you think about composting. A long, narrow pile of material that gets turned and churned every now and then. The main advantage of windrows is that it's simple. It's easily started and managed. Anybody can do it. Anybody almost. Build a windrow in their backyard pile. In their backyard and start composting or in the back porch. Really don't need any special equipment. And that's the reason most people. So here's an example of a farm who compost deer cattle manure with some waste from grocery stores and and some food processing facility for all vegetables in that case. And they simply make windrows with a skid steel loader that has an oversized bucket. Makes the windrows and turn every now and then. Fairly simple. When the turn, that's really a composter specific situation and preference. More units for them has to travelJulian manurenej. And here's theлюble milk jij �ожу who did not use amount of live procedures for. That's also known as gear for sonra kind of food processing the water. So again I had this I had found a hammerManٹki plant para tomatoes in that boat, this Unfortunately it was kind of a whore where the yard trimmings that it was getting from the municipality i don't think this operation i think it's closed down years ago but basically just to show you how they managed it they used an excavator as their primary turning device just every now and then move piles with the bucket on an excavator and they also use that to build the piles their their main objective here was the compost yard trimmings the horse farm is basically just an excuse to have an off farm when you're composting yard trimmings you're going to need to grind them up if you're taking any brush and then because there'll be a lot of wood still in it when you're done composting you'll need to screen out the oversized materials and in this case they use a trommel screen like that probably hired out both sides of that they hired in the grinder and hired out screen at the time uh here's another example of a window turned operation on in this case the farm compost manure with yard trimmings and also some food processing waste um and they turn they build their windrows with a loader and turn them with this tractor powered turner the tractor uh powers the turn both by pulling it um it's used for travel and also through the pto uh it drives the turner itself and you can see they have fairly wide aisles between windrows to accommodate the tractor on both sides although um you could actually stack two windows closer together you don't need an aisle for the tractor on both sides okay this is still that same farm um they do make an effort to water their windrows their windrow turner has nozzles on it so they can add water while they're turning and they have a tank wagon that they pull behind the turner which feeds the nozzles on the turner because they're handling our trimmings this uh farm also does some screening they own the satellite screen they used to make dr rink yes i just wanted to flag we have about 20 minutes left 20 minutes 20 minutes for my part for the presentation yeah just uh to leave to leave time for q a okay thank you linda um again this is another example of a farm that uses a window turner tractor assisted windrow turner in this case it's uh this farms in idaho so their dairy manure is from the outside lots and it tends to be dry um they add some bedding to it to improve the composting situation and they have a their turner has needs a tractor for travel but it has its own engine to power turner itself they have a mounted manure spreader that they build the piles with um and because it's in idaho because the material starts out dry and they get very little precipitation um they have water regularly and they use a tractor told why do i do that right after they do this it will come through with the turner and mix that water into the windrow okay so those are turn systems um the other is areas that are policy diagram of that um there is static piles more reliably keep um the contents of the pile aerobic because we're forcing air into there it also provides a level of temperature control using that air um cool down the pile so you get more process control with an area statify another important advantage of it is you taking all these materials that might have been in the windrow and pulling them all together into a wider higher pile we have a lower area requirement that means if you need to cover it it's more easily done than it's existing and these advantages particularly the low area requirement um have driven the conversion of a lot of windmill composting facilities on farms included for aerated static piles because it has a but with aerated static piles you have to add some um energy and engineering so it's still pretty simple you have a a pipe which serves as an air duct hooked to a blower with some control mechanisms that force air into the pile now these photos are from a wastewater treatment plant that composted biosolids but i could have told you this from the farm and it would have looked really to be able to build a lot of plastic this could be inside of a barn so it's still simple enough to be done on the farm this particular uh composter has very simple controls it's an on and off timer so the timer spends it some time on to aerate the windrow and cool it off and some time off to let it rest and do its thing and uh the timer settings would be adjusted uh manually based upon the temperatures for the operator there are more complicated control systems where uh the the blower might come on and off based upon temperature feedback there's a temperature sensor in the pile that sends a signal to the controls in terms of the flow rate on and off it's still fairly simple and then they're very sophisticated controls where the the fan runs continuously and the temperature sensor turns the the airflow rate up and down okay this is that same application so the equipment they use for that lower and this loader to build piles and take piles apart and then they have a mixer which mixes in the biosolids and wood chip amendment that they use in to create the right aeration conditions the right free airspace in bulk density for that time and this is just an auger based turner like many uh turners on farm like many mixers excuse me this is an auger based mixer like many on farm mixers that are used to mix feed rashes yeah here's a different version of an area static pile before we saw individual piles this is called an extended piles where each batch of material is built on the side of another to extend the pile and each batch is called cell and the cell may have its own area aeration pipe so you can see here one blower is feeding numerous cells through a manifold so this is on the farm this is a farm that used to compost by wind rows and found the advantages of an area static pile over the conversion this farm uses a fairly durable pipe it's high density polyethylene pipe as the duct work to avoid damaging the pipe when breaking down the piles they actually pull the pipe out using a tractor and chain this is this is the most common way of of running areas that are piles now is with durable pipe that gets pulled out before the piles get broken down the other option is to have a loader operator who's really good and can avoid pipe as much as possible um but more and more people are doing pipe going back here's another area static pile uh again this is farm they're composting uh dewater dairy manure solids and they decided to build the building to house the composting system and compost uh the solids in these bunkers uh the bunkers have a positive variation system in the floor uh i don't recall whether the it has pipes on the flowing on the floor or an aeration system that's built into the floor um but nevertheless it's a positive aeration system they're blowing up from the floor with materials here's a picture of the aeration systems on the bottom left the blowers and the pipe that are feeding each of these uh bunkers and each bunker has their own system um that person shining back in the light um he's not an angel although to me he has his name's peter moon he designed this system um peter's uh a very good fellow to know he he specializes in aerated uh static systems and he thought it does a lot of does a lot of work on farms helping farms to make an area that a pile system fit into their farming operation and he's put a lot of systems on farms all over the country and even outside the country in fact this is a peter moon design system this is a farm that uh compost yard trimmings from the community and its own farm waste and it often gets some waste from the hotel that it's associated with it's not a lot it's not a large scale system they do this uh undercover in these bunkers in this building each of these bins holds batch there are bins on both sides of the building and so they have one two three they have about uh eight to ten um of these bays which to work with uh when they're done in the base um piles sit out and the material sits in passive piles to cure okay so a fairly simple system their aerated system looks like this um so you can see the plenum on the bottom left um so the the air gets gets uh delivered into this plenum it's covered with the slatted boards um um air moves up through this the um spacing between the boards and up into the floor the floor is covered with a layer of wood chips to keep fines out of the aeration system and to help distribute the air from the aeration plenum up through the materials and on the right you see up um the shed the blower shed uh where the pipes are directly to the various uh um base and also the control system yeah it's fairly simple controls uh here's another example of an aerated static pile this one has a little different twist uh for one thing this is a negative aeration system um so this is continuous bed of dairy cattle dairy cattle manure mostly from heifers and calves so it's fairly highly bedded it doesn't need need to be mixed with a lot of amendment to have the right quality for accomplice and they just build these in strips okay and then uh start aerating them the air gets pulled down through the bed and this is what it looks like underneath okay the aeration system is in the floor the floor is covered with uh with wooden planks that have holes drilled in it beneath the wooden planks in is a trench the aeration pipe that occasionally delivers or it sucks air down through the wooden planks and into a manifold what's interesting about this system is they use it for heat recovery so here's the part we've seen the air moves down through the composting building the air moves down through the compost and then enters a manifold that's the blowers on the other side of the manifold that's what's sucking the air through the compost and then the blower delivers the air to this heat exchange um this is a bulk tank on one end and just a large conduit would be a foot long of pvc pipe on the other uh the hot air goes in the one end where the conduit is as a gas there's heat pipes in the middle heat pipe has refrigerant in it that the refrigerant evaporates on the hot end and then um condenses in the bulk tank where it gets cooled down and heats the water in the bulk tank and then that water is delivered to a floor for facility heating um one farm have used this to heat floors under calf beds and you can pull off some hot water out of this um several farms are doing this there's a company called agri lab technologies uh based in vermont that is doing a lot of this in farms in new england um they have since moved away from this uh heat pipe type of heat exchanger and uh develop others some that you get there starting to mount on these skits so they'll be moved from farm to farm so uh an interesting and uh intriguing twist to compost just another reason to compost is to recover that heat it's not being done a lot but in some places uh why not so the next method of composting would be within this giant category called contained or in vessel composting systems where the composting environment is closed within a container or a vessel so some of these are being done on farms by far uh it's mostly windrows and they're in static piles but there are places for these on certain farms under certain conditions okay almost all of these are require a second stage of composting that is the vessel is only the first part of composting where it's most important to have that encampment and almost all are situation where companies selling this vessel to you and they also support it but there's at least one example and probably more where it's homemade so this is a farm built enclosed aerated box you might it might be called a tunnel or a box composting system in other places and in this case it's handling dairy cattle and you can see a picture of the inside on the inside on the right there's positive aeration in the floor uh the air taken out the head space is recirculated a bit fed in with some fresh air what this does give you is just a little bit more control both of odors and the process i'm not sure on a farm this is justified um this farmer felt that he could pull it off by building it himself and he also wanted to recover the heat so there's some heat tubes in the top of this vessel in the top of this tunnel are just circulating air through the composting space circulating water through the composting space and picking up some heat and using it to to feed this uh radiator that blows warm air into their shop across the way so just another example um this is less an example and just the point that these types of in vessel systems are called agitated bays they're like windrows only they have solid walls and there's an automatic turner that runs through without an operator that that turn the material in these bays and also move it along doesn't just turn the material in place tends to pick it up and shift it so there's a material handling advantages here most of these when they're on farms are used for poultry manure because um poultry manure is a little more difficult to compost because of the odor and high nitrogen content um and in many cases it's not amended with low nitrogen so some a lot of this is uh here's a commercial system um okay it's called an earth flow system by the green mountain technologist company um this is a small scale you could call an agitated bay or an agitated vessel but um it's one of its target uses is on horse stables we have um horse bedding that they want to turn into compost and this can be done on site drums uh drums are another type of in vessel system uh key thing about drums it's a very short compost most drum handling material from three to six days and then it goes out and the advantage of the drum is it gets the process going quickly and it contains the material when it's most odorous okay so here's four examples all but the one on the upper right hand side are on farms the one in the upper right hand side is at a college uh but again it could be a farm uh and so they put the materials from quickly and then stack them in windrows or piles or area static files to finish the composting except the one on the bottom left it really is just recycling manure bedded manure to recover the bedding and reason so these drums are used in a lot of cases for that but they're another legitimate in vessel systems at times how am i doing on time now linda um we've got like six minutes left six minutes okay let's talk quickly about the site um the characteristics of the site so here's a farm farmstead's up top that that hypothetical situation is looking to um to compost on site and they're kind of identified this piece of land as a potential complex area so what do we need to know to see if this is a a legitimate site a feasible site or not well we've got to look at a couple things about the site one is the land slope uh which way does water flow uh when it falls on the site in this case there's sort of compound slope down in each of these directions all right so it would be straight down diagonally um other features of the site that you need to identify which direction is the prevailing wind i don't i don't put too much importance in prevailing wind direction in most cases because the wind changes so much in almost every site it blows from every direction um often enough that prevailing wind isn't a good predictor where odors are going to go most of the time but still it's good to know there's a creek near the site that's important because we can't be too close to that residences very important because that might be uh older impacts there and we want to know the distances from these things there are regulations that determine how far at a minimum you need to be from these things i can tell you those minimum separation distances between a composting site and residence they're not enough to prevent odor impacts to those residences you need to have good management as well but these are some of the things you need to identify where is the water which way is the land slope where are the residences and other other people that might be impacted where's the wind blow so this particular creek is about 300 feet from the edge of the composting site that's not bad most regulations would say that's within limits it would be buildable um there's a gravel road access to a composting site is important in this case there's a gravel road that connects the composting site to the farmstead which is where the materials are going to come from mostly manure so that's another important feature of the site um so you identify where you're going to do the things on your site based upon this i might mention on this particular site um i might discourage this composter from from choosing this site the site largely because not how far the residences are from the site but because few of them are directly downhill so on on a cold clear night where you get a temperature inversion and not too much wind um you get the condition where air from a composting site that might that might be on a hill or plateau as this one is would drain down downhill um and collect in low areas and cause odor that way this particular site is susceptible to that because of where the residents are uh and the the cold perhaps odorous air could collect in that uh in that stream down so then you can look a little closer and decide what you can do and where you can put things and then from these circle diagrams which is our way to start you can start doing a more detailed design maybe to scale but those are the features of the site again water is going to be important um increasingly important because water that runs off the working areas is fairly heavily polluted it has a lot of solids in it that um and so runoff carries a lot of organic matter as a high bod level and could become odorous so what you want to do is first of all you want to keep clean runoff that would tend to run onto the site from running off the site you want to divert it around the site and that's what these uh features circled in blue are they're dikes and berms and channels that are are intercepting the run on in this case and diverting it around the site and then you want to keep the water that does fall on the site on the site by collecting it and then concentrating it or treating it if necessary and so you would put it in a pond or an infiltration area never directly into a stream because it's fairly strong in organically so you need to capture it contain it and treat it if necessary reuse it that's the best way to do it um but need to control water on the site as i said earlier most of the strength of the water is in its um it's in a sediment that it carries so an easy way to improve the quality of the run-up water is to get sediment out and that's fairly easy you can use compost filter socks that are showing up the right hand corner or filter berms compost or wood chips uh or actually a a constructed sediment basin to do that but it's better to keep that if you're storing water in a pond it's better to take out the the sediment before it goes in the pond so the pond itself doesn't get odorless uh common question is you need a paved site and i would say really free for sure only if the regulations require it that's rarely required in farm situations but it might be in some cases and if regulations don't require it then probably you don't need a paved site but it's an advantage to have one um so even though it might be costly uh it can be worthwhile for instance in this picture this is you know what happens in in spring when the snow melts around the site at least on a day like today um this operation could work to have an asphalt path and then you can see that okay okay odor uh uh odor is going to be a problem there's a lot of things they can do um for composting generates odors because materials decompose the confidence that's it's the inherent connection you have decomposition odors are going to be clear but you don't necessarily have an odor problem you don't have an odor problem until the odors are emitted um and then they travel to someone who's going to object to them so there are several stages in an odor in the anime of an odor problem where accomplishing facility can intervene um to lessen that odor and make it acceptable to the neighborhood and community um and one of those is befriending the community and others are more um operational on the composting site okay so here are some odor management uh practices i'll call it the greatest hits isolated site is the best thing you can have keep from overloading the site with the organic materials because the more organic the more materials there are on the site that can generate odor the stronger the other can be contain or enclose odor sources if necessary but then there are there are simpler uh measures like prompt handling of feedstocks follow good composting practices maintain porosity um cdn ratio moisture content where there should be and area a few more timely turning watch when you turn not just how often the turn only when needed because when turning is done it's a quick intense release of odors uh one of my favorite odor control measures uh certainly uh well suited to farm is you use a bio cover okay the bio cover is nothing other than a layer on top of a pile or window that's generating odors it's a layer of material uh mostly compost or pre-compost before it's screen that still has some some woody material in it and you just put it on top and it's simple containment and what happens is the air moving up to the top of the pile is it is absorbed and water is condensed in this layer and much of the odor is contained not all of it and broken down and stuff so a very simple uh underused method of odor control uh so i know i went through all that kind of fast um and six minutes is probably up if you want more information uh the institute for local self-reliance is having uh its webinar and i believe they also have an online course that you can take to learn more about it i teach um with uh my partner matt cotton of foundations of composting class it's a one day class we teach this at the beginning of the u.s composting council conference every year uh this year it's in austin and i'm sure we'll be teaching on january 4th that mass man there is matt teaching if you want even more training um there are a number of uh multi-day hands-on training programs around uh maine has had one for a long time i don't know when they're starting theirs up again but the u.s compost or excuse me the compost research and education foundation runs a five-day course um around different parts of the country um and it's been fairly popular here's an idea of the curriculum um for you to get some hands-on training if you'd like uh the composting facility tours are particularly good that's by a high level okay i think i made it within time so thank you very much i apologize for rushing through this um but that's the time we have hopefully a great presentation um we have been collecting some questions as they've been coming in um so starting with a um clarification on the hot stage of composting the graph that you showed uh indicated it might take one to nine months for the active composting phase um but the person usually hears two to three weeks during that phase before before it moves into finishing or curing any comments on that if you have an uh uh close to ideal process um you can do that in two to three weeks um you can you can make compost that is ready to move into the curing phase with an ideal process and suitable feedstocks but in my experience uh in order to get most feedstocks to the point where it can go to the curing pile and should be piled without turning takes a lot longer than three excuse me three weeks more like two months at a minimum again it depends upon the feedstocks slowly composting feedstocks feedstocks that may have gone through some decom some uh stabilization already if it were for example the standard method for composting biosolids um which was developed by the usda at the beltsville research station sometimes it's called the beltsville ariated static file method typically recommended composting under aeration for three weeks and then go to curing for a month and then go to the uh biopsies first of all biosolids has already been through an anaerobic digestion process so it's partially stable but even then i don't think biosolids can be stabilized in three weeks i think it needs longer that's my personal feeling i think if you're going for three weeks you're rushing it but if you're doing that you need an ideal process certainly for aeration uh a fairly large amount of bulking agent that allows the aeration to be evenly distributed um and um the right seat and ratio and so on i think three weeks is pushing it that's great and that actually leads into another question how do you recommend getting good free airspace um the best way to get free airspace is to mix the materials to a bulk density uh of less than a thousand pounds per cubic yard by adding dry bulking materials wood chips would be um the best is usually the best choice because they're chunky they have good structure they stand up in a pile they don't compress they don't lose their structure as they decompose um in fact they go through the composting process almost unchanged and if you're not using them for mulch um you would end up screening them out wood chips are the best amendment to pick to mix with other materials to get that free airspace don't have wood chips you can do it with other bulky materials like corn cobs would be great peanut hulls would be great um chopped straw um even sawdust but if you use sawdust you have to use a lot of it and probably dry the material too much more and then add water back um the chunkier material would better which of sort of standard uh there's a question about whether you can make good compost using a large static pile that doesn't get turned much and is also not actively aerated yes you can make good compost in a large static pile some people make good compost in very large static piles i use the term massive passive for those so what you have to do in that case is wait the key to making compost when the conditions aren't good so like in a large pile it isn't aerated much um is a week for time to do its work so i i showed that picture where uh passively aerated piles heat up inside and that's the main way to aerate well in march piles if there's not a great deal of airflow through that thermal effect then you're relying on diffusion and it's going to take diffusion a while for that oxygen to creep into the pile and and the organisms to decompose material so yeah you can use a large pile um and you just have to take longer to do it that in itself is not a problem the problem with large piles and waiting for them is that it greatly increases the risk of spontaneous combustion occurring in the pile for that reason i don't recommend it um but i can pretty much say that if you have a large pile of actively decomposing material and you leave it in place without moving it within a month or two um you're going to get a high fire and that could be serious so although yes you can make compost in large piles without forced aeration um you're increasing the risk of fire great okay and then uh the question about the bio layer and whether six and say something like six inches of wet straw would work as a bio layer or any other recommendations for easily removable materials to use as a bio layer well once you're making compost you'll have compost at your disposal to use as a bio layer and that's the best one um it's better if the compost has some ferocity to it that will allow the the passive air movement that is already occurring to continue on through the bio layer but just finished compost will work and a six inch six four to six inch layer will do that um if you're if you have a screen and screen overs will work pretty well um my next suggestion would be a mixture of compost and wood chips um next after that would be just wood chips uh straw would work the problem with straws is it becomes matted down when it gets wet and it can become a barrier to aeration um so that would be the problem with straw but i think as a containment mechanism it would it would contain orders that we just um make the aeration condition within the pile of chop straw would be better than unchopped awesome thank you for all those options uh and the last question i'm going to ask before we do some final polling and close things up i think is an important one it's about uh curing is always discussed um as an important phase of composting but what's the actual downside if any of spreading a pile of on the field that is not completely cured um the downside of spreading material that is not fully cured is that um it has it still has um some compounds the compost still has some compounds um that are phytotoxic that that would hurt hurt the plants but if you're merely spreading compost on top of a of a field let's say during the fall or winter or onto a fallow field uh it shouldn't be a problem so um that's where i said the intended use of the compost is important in fact if you're spreading compost on the field maybe stability is not that important at all and you can cut it short you don't even have to cure it it depends entirely on its use if you're putting compost into a potting media it has to be very stable if you're incorporating compost into a garden it has to be fairly stable but spreading it on the field especially when um the field is not growing anything at the moment fine go ahead and do it saving yourself time and money awesome so i'm gonna call it there with the questions but thank you all for submitting them and i hope that some of the other ones that you all submitted will be answered in future sessions um but before we go uh just a few more quick polls first one being as an overview of the fundamentals of on-farm composting this webinar had too much information the right amount of information or not enough information giving you all just a few more seconds all righty it's always good to see this that a vast majority say the right amount of information so thank you dr rink for doing that um next question uh are there any questions that this presentation that were not answered by this presentation any questions you had about on-farm composting fundamentals i realized that it often takes some time to digest this information before you realize what questions you still have so hopefully um you all will get some answered in future sessions as well okay a couple more seconds so we're pretty even pretty split um but majority says no great uh we are considering doing like a live q a at some point um if that's of interest let us know and invite back some of the presenters from the the webinar in the webinar in the webinar in the webinar in the webinar in the webinar in the webinar so let us know if that's of interest final question um do you plan to participate in any of the other webinars in this series yes no maybe just a couple more seconds all right vast majority says yes say yes and that's fabulous for us to know and we're so glad uh the series is designed to sort of build over time um and hopefully we'll get to answer all those questions the burning questions you have about on-farm composting and compost use so thank you so much dr rank uh for your great presentation and thank you all for participating and we'll look forward to seeing you at the next webinar okay thank you all
