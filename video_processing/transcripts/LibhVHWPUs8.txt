 The one thing that Dirt Dog was missing was a 48 inch version of their tiller. These are top of the line tillers and they had them available in five, six and seven foot. We've been selling them for years now. Been asking them, when are you going to come out with a 48 inch? Well, guess what? You're looking at it right here. It is available. The same thing as a bigger version, just four foot wide. This is brand new, just arrived, still in the frame. Haven't even taken it out yet, but we're excited to show you. Put it in action. Going to be a great fit for the subcompact tractors. All right, so your 1025s, your Kubota BX, similar Coyotes, Mahindras, all that kind of thing as well.
