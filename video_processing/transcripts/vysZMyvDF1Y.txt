 Good morning friends, I am Darshana Mori, Assistant Professor of Fruit Science, Kekiva College of Horticulture, Nasi. Now I am going to discuss topic on different methods of weed control. In the methods of weed control, first is the principles of weed control. The first principle of weed control is prevention, that means to avoid the entry of weed seed into the field. Then second principle is the eradication, means the complete removal or destruction of weed seed. Then control, in control method, not completely remove of weed. Then management, management means the combination of different methods like biological method, chemical method, cultural method etc. Through this combination, complete removal of weed from the field can be possible. In this lecture, we will see the first method of weed control is mechanical method of weed control. Mechanical method of weed control is also called as physical method of weed control. are being employed ever since man began to grow crops. In the mechanical method, there are different methods like including tillage, hoeing, hand weeding, digging, chaining, sickling, moving, burning, flooding and mulching. The first is tillage. The tillage operation is the oldest method of weed control. Tillage removes the weed from the soil resulting in their death. Then it also weaken the plant through injury of the roots and then stem pruning reducing their competitiveness or regenerative capacity. Tillage also buries the weeds. Tillage operation includes flowing, disheasing, harrowing, leveling which is used to promote the germination of weed through soil turnover and the explosion of seed to sunlight which can be destroyed effectively later. Tillage is the first method of weed control. Then in case of perennial, both top and underground growth is injured and destroyed by tillage method. Tillage method. Then second one is the hoeing. So the hoeing is mostly destroy the perennial weeds. Top growth with the little effect on the underground plant parts resulting in regrowth. Then hoeing has been the most appropriate and widely used weeding process for weeds. Then it is however still a very useful implement to obtain results effectively and cheaply. So the second one is the hoeing. The hoeing is mostly destroy the perennial weeds. Top growth with the little effect on the underground plant parts resulting in regrowth. Then hoeing is also the most effective and widely used weeding tools for centuries. Then it is however still a very useful implement to obtain results effectively and cheaply. So the hoeing is also the most effective and effective in the plants. Then in supplements the cultivator in rows crop. Then hoeing is particularly more effective on the annuals and bi-annuals as weeds growth can be completely destroyed. This is the picture of hoeing. Then third one is the hand weeding. It is the oldest method of weed control. Hand weeding it is done by physical removal or pulling out of weed by hand or removal by implements called as khurpi which resembles sickles. So the hand weeding is done with the help of khurpi or sickle. It is probably the oldest method of controlling weeds and it is still a practical and efficient method of eliminating weeds in a crop and non-crop plants. It is very effective against annuals, bi-annuals and the controls only upper portion of perennials. So this method is mostly advantageous only for the upper portion of the perennial weeds. Then digging. In this picture the instrument is digger. Digging is very useful in case of perennial weeds to remove the underground propagating parts of weeds from the deeper layer of the soil. Digging is effective for the perennial weeds. Then one is sickling and moving. Sickling is also done by hand with the help of sickle to remove the top growth of the weeds to prevent the seed production and to starve the underground parts. Then sickling and next one is the moving. Moving is a machine operated practice mostly done in roadside and in lawns. Then it is popular in slopey areas where only the tall weeds, weed growth is sickled leaving the root system to hold the soil in a place to prevent the soil erosion. In this picture this is the moving or the mover mostly used for the lawn areas or the roadside areas. Then burning. Burning is mostly preferred for the sugar cane areas or the sugar cane field after harvesting of sugar cane. Burning or fire is often an economical and practical means of controlling weeds. It is used to dispose of vegetation, destroyed dry tops of weeds that have matured and kill green weeds. So, this method is mostly used for the crop or dispose of vegetation. Flooding is successful against weed species sensitive to longer period of submergence in water. So, this method is mostly used for those weeds that cannot be alive for longer period in water. Flooding kill plants by reducing the oxygen availability for the plant growth by blocking the air pores or reduce the supply of oxygen. Then success of flooding depends upon the complete submergence of weeds for longer period. So, this is the method of mechanical weed control. Then merits of mechanical method of weed control. Oldest and effective and economical method of weed control. It can be used for the large area and can be covered in a short term time. Then safe method for the environment and does not involve any skill. The weeding is possible in between the plants. Deep rooted weeds can be controlled effectively. Some of the demerits of mechanical method of weed control. It is labor consuming method and possibility of damage crop. Then requires ideal and optimum specific condition for the adaptation of mechanical method. So, this is all about mechanical method of weed control. Thank you.
