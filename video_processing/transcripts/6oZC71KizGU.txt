 Here's the... the Yeolams and the two aunties. You can see the shadows of where the sheep were lying down after breakfast. So they leave their warm body shadows. Isn't that right here Feather? Yeah, great white yolk is still on hers. So here's their hay and more of bedroom shadows. This is an alpaca footprint since I'm looking at different footprints. That's an alpaca. It's much bigger than a sheep footprint. Hello. You think I'm feeding you more now? That's not really happening. Maya? Yes. I know it's snow. Ow! You bit my finger. You wanted me to pay attention. You're bold biting my finger. Bold. So sheep footprints are kind of interesting because you have the two prong and then they drag. Often they drag their foot forward. It's not a clean... well that's a pretty clean footprint. She'd have a... leave a clean footprint if she walked forward. There you go. There's a clean sheep footprint. There's another one. Here's another one. There we go. A clean sheep footprint. But they're smaller both because they're yellow lambs than the big alpaca ones. The alpaca ones are right there. Those are the alpaca ones. Alpaca footprints. Oh and there's the human footprint. You can hardly see it in this... in the snow.
