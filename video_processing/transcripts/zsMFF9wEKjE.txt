 Hey y'all! A quick video demonstration of a garden watering control system that I'm building. Now what you see here is an HTML5 canvas that gets drawn on according to the state of the various valves. Right now I only have three set up so there's a bunch of stuff in here that's kind of disabled. So like check valve's not there, this check valve's not there, this is here, none of this side of the circuit's set up. I still need to get a water sensor that will work with this guy. And then here's a bunch of manual valves and here's my controlled valves. This will also be a control valve but it's not present. But anyway, so I'm SSH'd into the Raspberry Pi here that has an RTC module on it and has a little relay control board that go to my valves. And this is just sort of a really rough test setup so you know. But anyway, so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to use a little control panel applet or a little command line interface that I wrote to communicate with the daemon. So I'm going to turn zone one on and do an override. Zone one, so it's actually overridden which will mean that if there's an automatic schedule or an event driven system, that's what the red valve means, that that valve state won't change unless a human user does it or clears the override. But anyway, so valve one's not connected so it's not doing anything. That's this guy here. But if I go back, let's see I'll turn. Yeah. Doing this one hand, it sucks. So I'll turn on. Zone three which should just spray water. So you can see that zone three is active. It's actually going to a garden hose. Travels along the side of the house like so. And you can see our drip system running. Drips drips everywhere. So now we will activate number two and you can see that zone or that number three's LEDs on. So now we will activate number two which should just spray water everywhere. Cool. Now we will turn two off. And this display by the way is read only and it's based on Node.js. It's based on Node.js. So turn off three as well. Which yeah, Node.js sends periodic updates to the browser when the state changes. And that's how the control system is updated. There's a bit more work that needs to go in to getting everything ready. But in general this is kind of it. So the system also has a bleed valve. So let's turn off the water to it. And bleed the pressure. Nice. Anyway, yeah that's the uh, that's the old setup so far. Our sprinkler system will have three zones and selectable water source. Um, one being a rain tank and the other being the house water. But uh, yeah. This will probably run on a scheduler and also have like, we're thinking about adding um, soil moisture sensors and um, a sensor that will actually monitor this tank's level. Um, here. It'll make decisions about whether or not to use the house water. Basically what we're relying on is, uh, if we turn on the house water the pressure should be higher than the tank. Because it's compressed water. Which should blow back against that check valve. So that shouldn't uh, shouldn't send water through the system because the pressure differential is higher. But as long as this valve's off, water's coming out of the tank, it should just flow into the rest of the system. Which yeah, so. Still need to get that flow sensor figured out and set up. And the uh, rain takes, rain sensor. But yeah, we'll also have, you know, some other sensors and stuff that make decisions about what to do and how. But anyway, so this is the project so far. Should be pretty cool when it's done. But anyway, yeah, cheers.
