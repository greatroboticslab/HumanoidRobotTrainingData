 Well here we are in Surrey, Surrey Rec Centre, North Surrey Rec Centre at the Farmers Market as part of a partnership between the government, the Ministry of Health and the BC Association of Farmers Markets where we are going to provide even more opportunity for BC families, BC seniors to have access to the freshest, tastiest produce grown anywhere in the world, BC homegrown produce. Coupon books that will be made available through our partnerships for families to come to farmers markets like this across British Columbia. We give them to low-income families, pregnant women and seniors who are participating in skill-building programs like canning and learning about nutrition and cooking and then they use these coupons and they take them to the farmers market. We're having it in 21 communities this year and because we received two million dollars it's going to ramp up considerably next year and then the next year even more so we'll be really in a lot of communities as the years go on. This is a fantastic program it will help some of our clients to be able to connect to the farmers market those that will be the individuals and families may otherwise not have the opportunity to come and shop here and then get connect to the farmers and get connect to the land and the food so it's very exciting a lot of people are looking forward to it. It's a great initiative a way to further promote BC produce and healthy living healthy diets. 100iov3 across the floor Sun self
