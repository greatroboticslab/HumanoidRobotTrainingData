 I think one of the strengths of Ontario Asparagus is the freshness we're able to achieve. You can see behind me we've got a field that was just cut and when the product comes in from the field it's washed and cooled down and put directly into our cooler and from there it's processed in a timely manner and directly to the distribution centres and to our customers right across the country.
