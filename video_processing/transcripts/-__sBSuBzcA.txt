 We are right here ready to plant and we've got a beautiful machine here that we are hopefully going to figure out how to use. Now first thing I guess is the question why are we going to use machine transplanting. We could also do manual planting. So why are we doing this Lee? Well we are trying to act in as a contemporary way as possible. I think labour supplies in Asia are declining everywhere as the whole continent develops and systems to use less labour are evolving as we speak. And one way of using less labour is still the transplant because there are benefits in transplanting but to do it mechanically. This sort of machine was invented in Japan how long ago? 40 years ago? Probably 20-30 years ago at least. Yeah these kind of things have been in use in Japan, Korea and maybe China. But what we are seeing in recent years is that it's now moving on to other countries in India, South, East Asia and it's mainly because of labour shortage. And it's actually a business opportunity not just for the company selling the machines but also for small farmers who then become small entrepreneurs. So providing this as a service, as a planting service to other farmers and even for seedling growers. Because you need to have seedlings grown in a precise manner. You can see this here if you can zoom in. I don't know if you guys can do this. So you need these nice seedling mats here. So you can see how uniform the seedlings are. And of course it requires a special way of growing them so that you can pull them off in these muds and cut them into nice strips which you can then feed into this machine. And this is actually a new business even for women. We see this in some places in southern India. I've seen it. So women becoming seedling growers, selling the seedlings then to a machine operator or service provider. So what we are basically trying to do this year here is a labour saving, cost efficient, precise crop establishment technology that is as close as it gets and maybe even better than manual transplanting. But wait a minute. Last year we were talking about exactly the same things and off we went up to just over our knees in mud broadcasting. So what's changed? Why this sudden change in parts? Well because I think we will get a more precise crop establishment with this as a safer technology to start with under our conditions here with that kind of heavy and soft soil. And we may still try something else and the next crop is more dry and directly. You see if your hand seeding it wouldn't run on a gas so fast, right? That's right, that's right. Should have been using a carabao-drawn mechanical transplant. Just give us some more grain to eat. Yeah, we're nearly finished and by and large I would say it works. But it is actually quite hard work to walk even behind this machine because any time you hit a deep muddy spot you have to make sure that the wheels don't spin off. And we've had a number of patches there with standing water where basically it's so muddy that the seedlings because they're so small disappear. But here is a place where it looks quite okay. So you can see pretty good spacing and seedlings that hopefully will recover and grow quickly. But it has taken us a while and the machine has, the engine died a couple of times on the way, the planting mechanism got stuck once in a while. So it requires some skill I would say. Of course a trained operator or a professional would have done this much faster and probably better than we did. But well, we got it planted now, let's see how it goes. It seems a bit miraculous. Let's see.
