 Greenhouses and high tunnels are attractive because they allow us to grow plants that may struggle if we tried to grow them outdoors and it can extend the growing season about a month on each end. Some of the considerations to make when choosing the high tunnel or greenhouse structure for your backyard would be the plants that you want to grow and the material that you want to build your structure with. In this case we have a polyfilm cover over the top of this high tunnel and we have polycarbonate sides or ends to the high tunnel and of course glass is another option. Polycarbonate and film materials might be less expensive but they have a limited lifespan of maybe five to seven years. Another consideration would be venting and cooling. In the summer when it's really warm outside it's extremely hot on the inside of the structure which can stress the plants. So a door, sides that roll up or even a vent installed in the top of the structure will help let that hot air escape. The University of Wyoming has publications on high tunnel and greenhouse structures.
