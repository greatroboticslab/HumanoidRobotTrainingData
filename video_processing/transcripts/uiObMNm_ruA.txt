 Hello my friend, welcome to the Farm Life. Today we will explore great solutions for results from the garden to your table. Guava is not only famous for its sweet taste, but also rich in nutrition that we will introduce the billion-dollar guava growing process, applying modern agriculture technology to bring top-quality guava. Let's start the discovery process. The nursery in Zhanghua County, Taiwan, is where guava cultivation begins. The process of growing pearl guava begins with the selection of healthy guava sprouts. These sprouts are carefully planted to ensure that they are firmly attached to the soil, which is important for their early growth. When the sprouts are about a month old, they are ready to be transferred to the farm fields, where the raal work begins. Each sprout is planted by hand. It's essential to maintain a distance of 5 to 6.5 feet between each guava tree. This spacing allows for proper growth and ensures each tree gets the necessary nutrients without competing with others. After planting, the guava trees are equipped with a drip irrigation system, which is crucial for their growth. This system efficiently delivers the right amount of water directly to the roots. Water is sourced from nearby pumps and filtered to remove impurities, ensuring it is clean and safe for the plants. Nutrients can also be added to support healthy growth, helping the trees thrive as they develop. The drip irrigation system, a key aspect of agriculture technology, conserves water while supplying essential hydration to the guava trees. Regular maintenance is required for proper growth, including pruning and shaping when the tree is 4 months old. The grass around the trees is regularly pruned to prevent competition for nutrients and keep the plantation clean. Pruning encourages better growth by allowing the tree to focus its energy on fruit production rather than removing unwanted branches, improving air circulation, reducing the risk of disease, and promoting healthier growth. An important stage in guava cultivation is preparing the tree for fruiting. An important stage in guava cultivation is preparing the tree for fruiting. When the tree is ready to bear fruit, farmers will wrap the guava after cutting the tops of the branches. This directs nutrients to the fruit, ensuring that the guava grows large and sweet, which is essential for quality. In recent years, Taiwan has become a leader in producing high-quality guavas, with over 34,500 acres of guava orchards spread across the island. Each year, Taiwan harvests more than 440 million pounds of guava, with the most popular variety being the pearl guava. Weed management is also important for tree growth. High-quality pearl guavas are produced by allowing only one fruit to grow per branch, a selective process common in Japan that enhances fruit quality. The guavas are then wrapped in nylon bags which protect them from birds, insects, rain, and excessive sun exposure, creating a controlled environment for optimal growth. The wrapping ensures that the guavas develop without external interference, resulting in a more consistent and higher-quality product. The ripening period is about one and a half months, depending on the season. During summer, when rainfall is abundant, guavas are more susceptible to damage, making wrapping even more crucial. Meanwhile, branches are periodically pruned to maintain tree health and promote better fruit development. Production pruning is essential for managing tree growth and directing nutrients to developing fruits. As harvest time approaches, farmers check the sweetness of the guavas to determine their readiness. Specific techniques are used to ensure that only the sweetest and most mature fruits are harvested, which is crucial for delivering high-quality guavas to the market. Quality meets consumer expectations for taste and texture once the guavas reach the desired sweetness. The harvest is conducted carefully to avoid damaging the fruits. Farmers use scissors to cut each guava from the tree and gently place them in trays to prevent bruising. Known for its vibrant green skin, crisp texture, and sweet taste, this guava is a favorite both locally and abroad. Thanks to advanced farming techniques, Taiwanese guava farmers ensure top-notch quality in every fruit, making their guavas some of the best you'll find on the market. Whether you're enjoying it fresh or in a dish, Taiwan's guavas truly stand out for their flavor and quality. After harvesting, the stems are removed and the fruits are thoroughly washed in clean water. Washing the guavas thoroughly is crucial for removing any residues from the growing process. After washing, the fruits are neatly arranged in trays and wrapped in shock-absorbing foam to protect them during transportation. This packaging enhanced by agriculture technology ensures they reach the market in perfect condition. Finally, the carefully packaged guavas are loaded onto trucks and transported to distribution centers. From there, the guavas are sent to various locations for sale, marking the end of their journey from farm to market where consumers can enjoy their sweet flavor. Next, we'll take you to the bustling streets of Taiwan, showcasing the impressive guava cutting skills. A true art form in Taiwan's street food culture, watch talented vendors skillfully cut and peel fresh guavas with remarkable precision and speed.

See how they are sorted, packaged, and prepared so they reach you at their freshest quality. You will feel inspired and more connected to the origins of your favorite foods. Seedless raisins are among the most popular types of raisins today, accounting for nearly all of California's production and being widely exported. About 150,000 acres in the San Joaquin Valley near Fresno, California are cultivated by over 3,000 raisin growers to supply all of the raisins in the U.S. Two-thirds of this production is consumed in the U.S. and Canada, while the remaining third is exported to nearly 50 countries, primarily in Asia and Europe. Raisins are made from seedless vitus vinifera grapes, which are typically sun-dried on trays or left to dry on the vine. Popular seedless varieties include Thompson, Selma Pete, Fiesta, and Dew Vine. Growing grapes starts with digging holes to provide optimal conditions for the vines. Many farms now use mechanical technology, such as hole diggers, to create uniform holes, enhancing efficiency and saving time and effort. Selecting the right cultivar is the most crucial step in raisin production. The grape variety impacts yield, quality, and resistance to disease and weather. Choosing the appropriate variety optimizes raisin yield and quality while reducing growing risks. Have you seen this grape-growing method before? If so, leave a 9 in the comments. If this is your first time seeing it, go back to 0. We look forward to hearing from you. After digging the holes, workers plant the grape vines by placing each one in a hole, covering it with soil, and watering it for moisture. Combining machinery with human labor at this stage boosts productivity and ensures plant quality. After planting, irrigation is crucial for healthy grapevine growth. Modern drip irrigation technology is commonly used for precise and economical watering. Providing nutrients through organic and chemical fertilizers is essential, tailored to soil conditions and plant types. Sturdy stakes are essential to support growing vines, typically made of wood or metal and standing 6 to 8 feet tall. They should be installed before planting, allowing vines to be tied immediately afterward. Wire is attached to the stakes to promote vertical growth, ensuring the vines receive maximum light and making harvesting easier later on. In May, California grape farms begin to thrive, leading to the September harvest when dry, hot weather enhances sugar. Workers handpick each bunch for quality control, enduring temperatures up to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. After harvesting, grapes are sun-dried for about three weeks, preserving their sweetness and flavor. With technological advancements, many farms now use machinery for harvesting. Modern grape harvesters are designed for speed and efficiency, saving time and reducing labor costs. This method allows for the quick harvest of large quantities of grapes, making it ideal for large-scale production. Once the grapes are dried, they are collected and transported to the factory for processing and packaging. The processing involves cleaning the grapes to remove excess stems and leaves using conveyor belts and vacuum technology. Next, the raisins are size-graded and washed before undergoing laser sorting to eliminate unwanted materials. This ensures the highest quality raisins before packaging.
