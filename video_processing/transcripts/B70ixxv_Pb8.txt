 Michael Victor, On behalf of ILRI and Venture 37, I'd like to welcome everyone to the second part of our webinar series, this one on One Health, the critical crossroads of animal, human and environmental health, how do we really scale up One Health? My name's Michael Victor. I'm the head of communications and knowledge management at ILRI. And just wanted to mention that this is the second in the series. The first one was focused on leveraging livestock to combat malnutrition. And I did put the link to the webinar in the chat so you can view it there. So just as we get started, it'd be great to, if everyone could put their full name and organization on their name. You just go to your name, click on more, and you can then click on rename. So you should be able to rename and put your full name and your organization helps everyone identify who is here. You can also add your country if you want. We will be enabling closed captioning, which seems to help a little bit, but there's always often mistakes. So, but it does sometimes help. Remember to keep your microphones off when not speaking. I think most of the people we have as a webinar, so you won't have to worry about that. If you can't see or hear, please close and restart the Zoom. Sometimes things get stuck. Again, we are going to be using the chat a lot. So it'd be great if everybody could post questions or comments into the chat. We'll have a moderator who will be able to feed questions to the panel when we have that. And if you have questions to each of the speakers, please put them into the chat and they can answer them directly during the webinar. And just remember that the session is recorded and any private chats are often visible to us as well. We will also be live tweeting. So please, you know, please recognize that and we'll be tweeting so you can also tweet. Use the hashtag, please, why livestock matter, which helps a lot. Maybe Susan can put that into the chat. Okay, great. So with that, I'd like to introduce Mark Mitchell to kick us off and take us through the rest of the webinar. Thanks a lot and over to you, Mark. All right. Thank you, Michael. And I'm Mark Mitchell. I'm the director of Livestock and Dairy Activities with Venture 37. And we're going to set the context for today's discussion with this short film. It concerns land use policies and how at times they can be unintended consequences. And at the expense of the ecosystems. This video is on the privatization of land and around the Mara, Serengeti, Kenya and Tanzania, and demonstrates how diseases can spread when wildlife, livestock and humans cross over into each other's spaces. It's an integrated approach and we take it away, please. Start soon. Start. I'll see you in the next video. I'll see you in the next video. I'll see you in the next video. I'll see you in the next video. I'll see you in the next video. The video is a really important part. Sisi ni wafugaji, nafuga kondo, wombe, muguzi.

The Masaimaru situation in Kenya is a classic example of what happens when landscape policies are developed without a One Health approach. This is because One Health supports integrated management of landscapes that enhance sustainable coexistence of agriculture and wildlife. Many experts such as ecologists, vets, public health professionals and others need to be involved in government and private sector decision making and planning processes. We have been using cases like two, they have been a lot of people. We have been able to get a lot of work, we have a lot of work, we have a lot of work, we have a lot of work, we have a lot of work. We have been able to get a lot of work. When our family is collected, we have to go to work on theinv handicap Association. But the work İ integrihed is used, we have to be able to get a lot of work, an income is also used as a low income they were able toincture and understand how many people are to enjoy jobs and think about the farm.

The choices we make about ecosystems have important consequences, sometimes unintended ones on human and animal health. A one health approach helps reduce further destruction and fragmentation of wild habitats, incorporating biodiversity values, while at the same time considering the health and nutrition needs of people. Okay, thank you. Now I'd like to introduce Christina Rossell. She is a scientist in the animal and human health program at ILRI. Christina holds a diploma of veterinary medicine and a PhD in biomedical sciences. She has led a number of projects on one health and now leads a new ILRI led BMZ investment on improving animal and human health in Uganda. And helps conceptualize the BMZ funded ILRI One Health Center for Africa, which we'll hear about more in our panel discussion. Her particular interests include research on the epidemiology of diseases in the interface of livestock, wildlife and human health. Parasitology working with students. Well, in the north south and the south south technology and the knowledge transfer. And we welcome you here today, Christina. Thank you for the introduction and sorry to everyone who expected Delia here today. I am stepping in for her today. And yes, I want to talk about the role of livestock research at the One Health Interface today, just to set the scene for the following panelists. And coming from ILRI, of course, our core business is livestock research, and we are working based on a number of opportunities and challenges that have been identified over the years. And one of the biggest challenges probably how to feed the global population in the future, because population growth is one of the biggest issues pressuring our planet. And we see that there's disparity between current meat or animal source food consumption between high income and low and middle income countries. And majority of the population growth will happen in the global south in the future. That's also where a lot of the potential is for growth of the sector for opportunities to reduce poverty, increase equity and livelihoods. However, all these things come with a lot of challenges and not only at a local level, but also regional and global level. That is, of course, the emergence of azoonotic diseases. We know that more than two thirds of the pathogens, they originate in animals and at some point in time have a spillover event to humans. Also, increased livestock production comes with an increase of ox antimicrobials for the livestock healthy, which comes with a lot of pressure on the environment and microbes and increasing the risk for antimicrobial resistance. More livestock also means more methane contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and of course global warming, which needs to be limited. And of course, the more mammals for food or for eating that food live on this planet, the more we have environmental pollution, land and water degradation, which again increases the risk for spillover. So some of the key one health elements that we focus on are to be prepared to detect and to respond, and all of them, just like in the one health Venn diagram. Well, these three different circles overlap also these three components preparedness detection and response. They also overlap, and they cannot see independently and I'll give a few examples today. And I think the following speakers, they will then go more into the details and give more examples from their work. So, to be prepared, we need to know where to put our money. That's always a big question by investors. We want to solve all problems at the same time. We don't know where to target investments. Often we come too late and try and solve problems when they're already there. So data is one of the biggest issues we face in the global south. We don't have data to prioritize. We don't have data for surveillance and monitoring. And therefore, we also lack data to target our interventions and limited resources. So that is one of the major contributions that livestock research can make. On top of that, we have to utilize what we have, and that is a lot of local capacity. We don't have to take interventions that have worked in the north and implement them in the south and expect the same results. We have to utilize local knowledge. We have to localize local resources, local capacity, and try and build this capacity, improve this capacity, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel. And I think Bernard will talk more about this later. And by being prepared and investing early enough in data generation and building local capacity, we can actually save a lot of money. As these two examples show investment in yellow in the right figure, investment in keeping poultry, vaccinating poultry against avian influenza can really reduce the economic burden on affected countries. The second component is detection. And that's where biomedical sciences come in, of course, but also social sciences. And of course, we need to understand these different zoonotic pathogens. We need to understand where they come from, where they live, how they survive in the environment. Is it mosquitoes? Is it waters? Is it wildlife reservoirs? Is it livestock reservoirs? Is it totaIN, they捕ura the bacteria can really affect, water? Is three dairy? Can you extract this story with люблю本er talking to rapper tra Elektra MicrofBosurles, no matter how much fresh thatsentfoundhun. And frankly, you have been taking a tyle a produced study that can evolve into the local συ pandemic. You know, where cutting social sciences are really cubic. one example is shown here on the right that work is mostly generated by bernard and tim we look at data on rift valley fever we do entomological studies we know animal reservoirs for rift valley fever we know precipitation patterns we know uh altitudes we have all this data it's out there and we're trying to fill data gaps with our field surveys but then this data needs to be consolidated so that decision makers know okay we have a vaccine for livestock let's go to the high risk areas and these are the ones in red and we need this for many of the health subjects and this is a good transition to the response and the response is not just about having a vaccine ready it's also about getting to the vaccine to those people who need it and covet is one of these examples in a in the global effort and miracle we have a vaccine already but in east africa and other parts of africa and southeast asia many people have not yet benefited from the vaccine it's very difficult to get it to people to have people accept the vaccine to have access to it governments are struggling with buying vaccines and uh therefore yeah the vaccine is not available and which leads again to a global problem of not having herd immunity through vaccination covet is just one example this happens with a number of the health interventions we are researching so these components acceptability accessibility accessibility affordability availability and incentives are quite crucial in getting interventions or research into use and that is also just as the way we're trying to generate data getting interventions out requires participation by the end users communities and i guess we'll hear a bit more about this about rangeland land management in a bit finally i wanted to highlight again two of the recent publications that give very constructive advice to investors on where to invest what research gaps do we still have where are the data needs and how we can intervene in preventing not only the next pandemic but also preventing other uh health uh problems at the human animal environment interface these are also the neglected zoonotic diseases such as tapeworms brucellosis um sleeping sickness uh diseases that usually affect low and middle income countries uh we also have a silent pandemic antimicrobial resistance so we're not just talking about the big scares um we give um yeah an investment advice for a challenge these major anthropogenic drivers of zoonotic disease emergence so this is my little um presentation to set the scene and now to i can take questions if that is in the agenda mark and otherwise i'll hand back to you all right thank you ma'am we're gonna switch quickly to um uh let's see bernard and i'm gonna skip through this quickly so that bernard gains a little time back and if you are ready to go bernard you can start talking to us about uh the policy uh process and the scaling out at your level thank you thanks mark my name is bernard bett i work with ilry as a senior scientist currently heading the one health center which christina um mentioned so um i'm presenting this for focusing on how we are planning to scale up scale out one health practices and policies in sub-saharan africa and i'm working with a big team of people including lian christina ashley delia and hung this is a project which is funded currently by bmz so let's go to the next slide yes so this is first of all to to clarify or to set up the terminologies that we are using when we talk about scaling we really mean an ambitious process to expand the coverage of one health either through institute institutionalization that's making sure that policy makers right at the national sub-national levels are able to apply one health principles but also there's a component on horizontal expansion this is involving many other players within the same levels of application but in the process of scaling up we are not just thinking of spreading out we are only thinking of refining these institutions these practices realizing that you know we are not really here to start off from the beginning but many other players have originally set up platforms and and and processes much earlier so we're just helping to improve on the quality the main uh issue though is to really identify what's that scalable unit because we know one health is quite broad we really need to identify what's the key component of one health that can be scaled so let's go to the next slide and i give examples of vertical scaling and this again that's what i meant institutionalization and currently we are looking at the platforms which were developed by countries regional economic blocks the tripartite and many other players in the region and trying to ask ourselves what are the competencies how are these platforms working so we are using an evaluation tool that's called network for evaluation of one health which is classical published and it's being used in many places to identify those gaps in planning thinking working sharing one health activities and the main aim here is to identify what which areas can we specifically implement interventions to make these platforms work much more effectively the second issue though would be research for development and this is where we're thinking of we want to demonstrate how new evidence can be used to inform decision making but also to to inform networking partnerships so that it can really come out so clearly on which areas would those partnerships work better for disease control so on the next slide i give a small example on horizontal scaling what we do here is basically about building graduate fellowship programs so that we can get more leaders more students more technical expertise being used in the region and it involves training students within here at ilri but also helping local universities in developing new curricula on one health through our research partnerships also with governments NGOs private sectors we hope that in the process of us implementing research with them those one health competencies come out strongly and they get recognized as ways of doing business but lastly also is we are really launching community outreach activities which aim to build capacities at the local levels but also there's a frontline staff here including you know community-based animal health workers or community health volunteers who are working in the public public health sector so all those people are brought on board to work together in the local levels i think i have the second last slide which talks about the opportunities that we have to build all these activities and one of them is um they say huge interests locally on building one health platforms and i think that interest would really help us to to move on from there there's also one health platforms which have been developed as i said earlier on and there's a huge um skilled manpower in mainstream government departments which can be brought on board in building all these initiatives but of course as you know there are many challenges and main the main one of course is being funding levels are low the other thing is conceptualization of one health you know one health is quite broad and many people may not really define what we mean by a scalable unit that needs to be determined for us to know where we begin from and where we reach in terms of taking it forward uh the the one thing that i also find very useful is to identify reliable tools for assessment you know we keep doing there are many tools which are being used currently for assessing scaling in many interventions in veterinary even public health but those ones have not really been fine-tuned to capture one health and those are the limitations that we still face up to now lastly of course one health as we know it is very much on prevention of diseases of course it can be used for management of diseases but most of the time we want to use them for prevention prevention but we know communities and many people in the on the ground are really very much tailored towards using curative services and not prevent preventive services and that's this this need for a mind my change in mindset in terms of how those services are used so i think i have only the two slides one is on acknowledging partners and we have many partners in this region but the last one which i want to emphasize is we have had huge support from um a cgir research program called fnh which was led by ifpre for the last 10 years they have been helping us to do one health and it's coming to an end in december this year so very much um i'd like to acknowledge the support that we have gotten from them so thanks mark that's the end of my presentation okay thank you bernard uh we're gonna quickly switch over to uh a usda funded project and hear from uh lasia and the situation they're facing in georgia please lasia thank you mark greetings let me present safety and quality investment livestock or simply skill activities under the one health principles skill project is financed by the usda is and implemented by the lando lakes venture 37 in georgia with our local partner georgian farmers association following farm to fork principles project aims to to support food safety and quality improvement increase productivity and trade within the georgian dairy and beef market systems value chain next slide please as i mentioned skill major task is to support market systems development so i would like to focus on how the skill operates in the strengthening one health approach in the market systems developing context system includes value and jail actors starting from the input suppliers farmers processors distributors all the way to the final consumers but also on top of it the market systems don't not that we say we have a role to develop supporting functions such as strengthening education centers sectoral trainers service providers etc and let me give you an example here recently skill trained call center operators of the ministry of environmental protection and agriculture of georgia in animal health and food safety matters and was first for them ever such technical training on the other hand we try to strengthen local rules and regulations through capacity building of the related state authorities developing market-led safety quality systems and mediating public private partnership as an additional example we conducted the workshop regarding newly adopted regulation and animal byproducts their use and disposal next slide please so what are the tools in the toolbox uh as uh knowledge and awareness of the local sectoral actors was identified as one of the biggest challenges we conducted set of the trainings in different wild house related topics and let me give you some examples from this list food safety and hygiene principles that included hasop system for daily and pre-processors we also train all state and private slaughterhouse veterinarians in meat inspection and as you see on the right in the pictures the environment of the trainings varies from the actual practice in the processing plant or or more in kind of community-based interactions next slide please also we try to to cover gaps of developing education materials such are for our case manuals and booklets and guidebooks for that activity we had a small motivator like 120 nanometer small motivator as basically all kind of people large gatherings is still restricted for more than a year now so we have to adapt materials will print in the distributed through our partners as well as electronic brushes are uploaded in the local farmers platform when our partners let's say was the national food agency and they disseminated these manuals to cattle farmers through their state animal vaccination campaigns and here on the right you can see example of one of our education materials regarding veterinary medicine products which explains the the health one health and general health principles as well as veterinary medicines residues flow from animals to humans to environment this manual also contains the information regarding antimicrobial resistance but on more like a simple farmers understandable language next slide please and here i have a list of the other materials as you can see and the content of them and i would highlight a practical manual for the slaughterhouse veterinarians how to protect farm from the chronic disease as well as an annual or a vector board disease prevention is also pending next place slide please in order to promote those education materials skill developed animated videos that you can see these videos are simple way reflecting the key messages of the education materials these videos were designated through the social media and popular regional traditions and i believe that strength of this concept was to provide awareness regarding the main highlights of that very subject but also at the same time aware target groups regarding existence of these very materials to be either downloaded from the web platform or gained through the scale of partners so with this approach we are able to educate target beneficiaries through the combined method of the videos plus manuals that do not actually require the gathering of further people and it's also a cost effective as a challenge that we identified in the process access of the electronic platform by the farmers is quite limited but on the other hand on the opportunity side we think and we're planning to translate those education materials into english which are currently in georgia to share amongst other venture 37 projects next slide please and basically that's the final slide so we try to adopt to the to the existing uh pandemic situation by uh providing and disseminating knowledge regarding one health principles and related actions in livestock sector market systems that's the way it is thank you very much okay thank you lasia and the last of our speed talks here it will come from medessa and the ilri hill program if you could uh please start that discussion my name is but as i work for international livestock research institute i'm a regional scientist the topic i'm going to talk on is linking greenland management to one health in utopia uh rangeland is important for one health because this rangeland is a vast land area that cover the world service and also it is support millions of people's pastoralists who are depending on the rangeland through reading of livestock production and also it is good for ecosystem service functioning well so that one health brings these three components by including rangeland health to improve the livelihood and ecosystem service for the community who are living there one of the projects which is integrating the environmental aspect is heat this project is actually the constant troop led by vcfcus along with ccm and early as with the objective of to enhance the vulnerable community to have a sustainable uh uh well-being that the project is conducted in three k in three countries topia kenya somalia with an approach of bringing three these three components animal human environmentalists to have a good delivery service of one health service at the the ground level for the pastoralists and this project also engage different community levels including women men to have uh to accommodate their need that uh that to have a one health service delivery and also to have a cost effective approach for this this one itself is delivery and as in the end of the day this should be a model or a solution of silver silver service delivery that should be recognized by different stockers like a policy maker for the pastoralists as a whole uh most of the initiative of one health is lacking this environmental health so he'll make unique because of including this one health uh uh environmental health through an approach of pastoralist management this participatory range land management have three stage uh and a different uh uh eight of uh different steps so this actually a process uh that maintains the community management plan and improving the institution of this community uh arrangement management from this uh from rangeland there is a livestock disease distribution and also there are different rangeland condition so the disease and the regular condition are highly integrated or correlated uh they are function together so this prm is uh bringing into the process of animal disease to be integrated well from for example if we take from our uh one side of downland which is found in moya registry how one health and the grazing are uh really linked together show us movement through concentration of livestock and high degradation of rangeland shows us how one health is and the grazing and uh integrated uh uh from this uh uh institutional role uh to bring to bring together a different institution which are uh to act for one health center uh to learn from each other he'll uh develop it uh msip uh for a stakeholder to discuss a learning because of uh environmental health is uh broader so that to understand what rangeland helps me so msip is a much like a style stakeholder innovation platform where uh many stakeholders are really from each other or to avoid the challenges of not understanding the whole environment from this rangeland houses so the service delivery is to improve the rangeland which are highly degraded or to minimum to maintain the rangeland size as it is so to have uneducated pasture as a sum up rangeland health is a key improving the whole system of the ecosystem and the productivity of the whole area that improve the livelihood and the community as well so that bringing of animal human uh rangeland health is a good to link to rangeland management to have a wider impact of the livelihood of communities so thank you if you have questions welcome thank you badessa um we've now heard from uh three different programs and how they are scaling one health in policy uh training public and private sector activities and environmental pathways and we're going to change over to some questions now and i'd like to lead off by asking bernard how they've been able to reconcile the differing interests between their stakeholders we naturally find that there's a little bit of difference between what donors want what local governments want and what livestock owners want and i'd like to hear your views on this process thanks matt matt for that question so um yes you are right and most of the donors or most of the development agencies usually fund those challenges or those those issues which address epidemics pandemics with international concern usually they look at risks which transcend countries and and and regions but we we we find that the the stakeholders or the the people we deal with at the community level are very much interested in managing day-to-day challenges in terms of endemic diseases and things which we call production um which may not really attract external um interest so but i think there is a win-win um um there's a room for win-win situation there because the support we get from external uh development partners which address pandemics and epidemics can still help in building universal surveillance systems or build capacity which might be used to manage multiple challenges at the same time so in that way i think um you can still find a common ground where that external support can still be used to build capacity even to manage local problems and that's what we're doing to manage local problems and we're doing to manage local problems thank you sir um last time i'm gonna turn to you next to kind of follow the order of the speakers there and what curious how you're building capacity at the farm level to prevent the spread of zoodonic disease what what are producers uh the livestock owners knowledge and awareness of one health challenges how how are they facing this uh well mark um as i mentioned during my presentation uh one of the skill developed uh education material was manual for main chronic diseases of cattle and for georgia that would be a brucellosis tuberculosis and leucosus so we developed the manual that contains the practical examples of the clinical science disease prevention also diagnostic practices uh manual also explains kind of uh existing regulations and also explains that this is very important the primary actions to be taken in case of the disease species before even the veterinarians engagement also we put like sticky posters of the disease clinical science and also key messages that uh are attached to the manual and this uh owners of the farms that have been dealt and delivered could stick them on the walls where the employees sing around so they will have always the major information in front of them the abortion and other clinical signs and also highlight and also clinical science in humans as well so they would you know understand that they might be exposed so in my opinion that's the the practical example how to be aware of the farmers on one health issues and try to get them on our ls thank you um and but there's so we're looking at the environmental part of our tripartite and and we diagram one health why is it is it challenging to incorporate one health into the environmental issues and so thank you mark uh yes it is uh if you see many of the final initiatives the environmental health is lacking uh this neglected uh many initiatives this may maybe because of uh this environmental research uh is as well��HHHHLM uh the 다음 EPHAD goals program your health partner a Martin to different areas. Like if you take a series of indigenous pastoralists, which is sometimes they are conflict each other in some areas. So this is the main point why environment is not as others. Okay, thank you for that interesting bit of information. You know, we've labeled this as a hard talk session. And so the hardest question I'm gonna pose back to Christina, where she led us off today. And as a thought leader in this field, where does the focus on One Health and livestock provide the greatest impact? Well, there's not a silver bullet answer to that because the context of any health problem is different in each country, right? So I think the focus should be on, yeah, the local context actually, in which the animal diseases, yeah, navigate and the pathogens navigate. And that's the reason why I'm saying this in Southeast Asia, for example, where you have a much higher peak population, you know, pigs as a livestock species would be of much, more importance than cattle and small ruminants in East Africa, for example. And maybe I would like to pass this on to my colleague Bernard, who is more of a local leader in One Health than I am. Thanks. Sure, Bernard, if you would like to follow up, please. No, I think Christina managed it well by saying, you know, it varies from one place to another. But maybe one thing that jumped into mind, because I can see in your question, there's a labeling of livestock. And since we are thinking of One Health, you know, livestock usually is considered to be under-resourced in many places. And so I guess bringing in One Health in that perspective might actually help to enhance service delivery, not just looking at disease per se, but also managing multiple facets of livestock service delivery. In this region, for example, you know, many, many remote locations. There's a big challenge on that. And so I see One Health can really help us to reach into the, those people who are considered to be left behind by previous interventions. Okay, thank you. We have a couple of extra minutes. There are specific questions from the chat box that anyone would like to draw my attention to. Otherwise, I'm going to jump to one of our other questions here. What I'd like to ask is each of you just quickly to give me a quick answer to say, which part of One Health changes or the program implementation that you've dealt with has been the most difficult? Has it been with the local governments, the private sector, the veterinarians or the community animal health workers or the farmers themselves? And Bernard, if I could start with you, which, which of those partners in all of this has been the slowest to make change? That's a difficult question. I would say government because, you know, if you look at the other actors which you have in the list, if an intervention is really beneficial to them, they will adjust immediately, you know, private sector farmers. But for government, you know, you really need to put in place policies, rules before everybody else come to the same table. So I think for me to be government. Okay. And Lasha, how would you talk about this question? That's tough, Mark, but probably for us, it's the engagement of the farmers. Because to let them understand that something which is not always linked to their income, sometimes opposite, that matters. For instance, antimicrobial resistance, a proper use of the veterinary medicine products, a proper waste of byproducts, et cetera. And that could, I mean, this process is a slow process and it's more and more engagement from all the partners. Okay. And the same question to you, Bidessa. What part of the partnership has been difficult for you? It's hard, actually. It is from a perspective of like a because I've seen this environmental because it is an understanding of health aspect is somewhat different from Rangeland because it is a government and if you are like we see from a pastoralist point of view, different organization are there. So in some of them also say government. Okay. Thank you. And we have one question that's come in from Abdel Fatha. And what are your thoughts on selecting for poultry or livestock that are genetically predisposed or resistant to any of the avian influences or other diseases? And what's work is being done on the crossbreds for that process? I'm not quite sure who is best to answer that question if you'd like to speak up. Do we have someone who's been handling the selection of poultry and livestock for genetic and avian influenza? We already had a discussion on that in the chat. This is Christina. And I mean, I'm not speaking for Ileri. We are not working on selecting breeds resistant to avian influenza. We do that kind of work, breeding and crossbreeding disease resistant animals, even genetic engineering to generate disease resistant animals. But yeah, it can work in the lab. You still need to get it to the community. So one of the examples I brought up was the Dama cattle from West Africa, which is very small but resistant to trypanosoma infections. And the Maasai herders in East Africa really didn't like it because it was too small, not considered a real cow. So even though that that cattle breed was resistant to disease, they opted for the disease. So and we have other examples where we are trying to crossbreed sheep that are resistant to worm infections. And it's definitely a good biomedical or genetical approach to disease control. And but it's others working on avian influenza breeding. Thanks. I hope that helps a bit. Yeah, thank you. It looks like a good question has come up for. Looks like Bernard or Bedessa. And the question is, do not confections form the bulk of reemerging or emerging disease burden that could benefit the attention of one health and management? What is being done to actually manage the introductions from wildlife? So I think that might be closer to Bedessa. Yeah, I'm in my perspective view, because that's why we put a participatory range land management bring to this one health approach to the range land management. So if we have integrated integrated management plan, this whole thing should be minimized to have sort of this issue of health. Health for management actually the wild five. So now we are like if we take the pastoral area, there is a wildlife, there is a climate change, there is a land health. So these are under the umbrella of environment. So we are doing this project by combining together having a strong integrated management plan to be integrated into our health. And I've noticed that the landscape and the landscape and the landscape and the landscape and the landscape and the landscape. And I've noticed that Lasha would like to speak on that as well as we think through the question on this crossover from from wildlife. Lasha, please. Thank you, Mark. So actually one of the materials that we also developed is regarding how to build the cattle farm. And that also includes how to select the place, a lot of about biosecurity measures and all the threats that come to the farm from the wildlife, from the imported animals and other sources. But and that's I believe is part of the answer as well, how to separate or how to protect the livestock and therefore humans later on. Okay, we're going to squeeze in one last question and anyone can pop in on this answer. Okay. What is the one thing that we could do today that would improve or motivate buy in from one health around the world? Is it, you know, the livestock, the livestock owners, the funding, the people were involved, or is it the markets that we need to put pressure on? How how would you guys discuss this topic? Who would like to go first? How about Bernard? You've been quick on the answers today. Oh, well, yeah, that's, that's really a big question. So, I would, I would say, I think if we get a stronger consumer demand on on on healthy and, you know, health landscapes and healthy food, I think they can drive much more than just, you know, a supply side of things. So I think the demand can really shape how more healthy value chains can be developed. And I'm hoping that would really also force the private sector to come into into into into the picture much more. Okay. Lassie, let's build on that private sector notion. How would you answer the question? Well, actually, Mark, now we're on the way of developing the market, like the food safety and quality standard on primary production level. And I agree with Bernard that yes, they indeed the consumers awareness demand from the consumers needs to be there. But also we should support the production and primary production processing level to to meet up the standards, the standards that sets the government, but also, especially the market let standards that motivates the processors to to move on. Thank you, sir. Well, we've heard from our panelists now, and I want to give time for a wrap up here from Christine. Yes, she's the global health security initiative, senior livestock advisor with USA IDs Bureau of humanitarian assistance. She provides technical support on saving lives and livelihoods of livestock keepers and fisher folks. She liaises with global humanitarian and resilience communities on issues regarding food security and food systems, animal health, emerging and transparent diseases. She has over 30 years of experience and working in over 40 countries. And so we'd like to use her expertise to put a final note on today's webinar. Christine, please. Thank you, Mark. And thank you to all the speakers today. I've really learned a lot. I want to highlight a few things I liked how the speakers were kind of organized in research policy and then really looking at practice from Christina. We learned about the importance of preparing, detecting and responding in one health approaches preparing in terms of particularly focusing on localization detection and both both the importance of the biomedical and the social sciences. You know, it's important to remember that disease isn't simply a biological problem. It's a social economic problem requiring one health approaches and then responding in terms of coordination and targeting at all levels. One of our main lessons from responding to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa that ended in 2016 was the need for improved coordination. And it's a lesson we are learning again in the COVID-19 pandemic from Bernard. From Bernard, we were introduced to the one health regional center for Africa with its focus on policy and scaling. And it was good to hear Bernard recognize the challenge of conceptualizing one health and the need to integrate that into scaling approaches. Both at the in in public efforts, such as the national one health platforms, as well as graduate programs and community outreach. And then from Lasha and Vanessa, we really had a nice look into examples of putting one health into practice, both in market systems, as well as in terms of linking range land health to one health. And so, what came out from the discussion and contribution of the participants for me is that one health is not just an approach to research. It's also an approach to practice policy capacity building that recognizes and supports the inextricable linkages between environmental animal and human health. As livestock experts, we need to continually challenge ourselves to think about and address what livestock research and development means for the health and well being of people and the environments in which we live. And how often we should be asking ourselves, are we collaborating with the ecological and human health communities. Thanks, Mark. Thank you. I'm going to hand back over to Michael now, and he'll take walk us through our ending points. Thank you all for attending. Hi, thanks a lot, Mark. And thanks a lot, Christine. That was really interesting. With that, it would just be really great to hear from everybody if they can put into the chat just what were your main messages. That came out of the that came out of the webinar. Be really good to see what people want. And as we're as people are as you're typing that in please type it in and and we'll take a look at what you have. We will be having another webinar hopefully before the end of the year we'll let you know all the the presentation and the the recording we will send out to everybody as well. So let's see, is anybody have any key comments. Andres had some something about where can they find more reading about one health. Maybe Christina could put some some links there. We have a one health page on the Ilry website as well. The Georgia Spiel Program has a Facebook page that will direct you to a lot of materials there as well. And all to the so to the Georgia Farmers Association. GFA. Excellent. Okay, let's see if there's anything else. If not, I think we're we've come to the end and perfect timing. Good job, Mark. I'd like to really thank everyone behind the scenes. We had Madeline Madeline bought list from venture 37. We had Tessa Martin from venture 37. Murray from Ilry. We had Susan and we have Jeffrey as well all kind of helping out and really helping to make this this webinar series go. I'd also like again to thank Christina for really jumping in and fortunately Delia couldn't come today as well. But really, this was a nice conversation and thank you everyone for attending.
