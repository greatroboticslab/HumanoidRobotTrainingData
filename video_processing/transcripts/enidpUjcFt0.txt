 Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Hello, welcome to yet another edition of the Harvest Money Show on Urban TV. I am your host Jackie Achan. Now when it comes to poultry farming, today when we speak poultry farming, what will come into most people's minds is you know, the modern breeds of chickens that are found in farms. Music Music way of you know from the traditional chickens they still keep these traditional chickens as a way of making you know money and in big numbers I could say they still keep these chickens to make money in its large quantities because they believe this is the best breed that most people love and can generate a lot of income now imagine if you go to maybe a local breed or hen it could go for about 20 no that is little money it could go between for between 35,000 to 40,000 just one and if you went for your usual broilers that are very common in the market you'll get that for about 8,000 to you know 20,000 shillings that is a big difference so the people who have remained on the traditional chickens are actually making quite a big kill and today we want to speak to Gloria Lydia Damzungu a master's graduate who actually left all that aside to concentrate on raising you know local breeds of chicken to make money out of them on the harvest money show today she will be sharing with us how she has managed you know to fulfill this dream of has of raising local breeds of chicken or I could say keeping local breeds of chicken to make money out of it so without wasting time let's get this show started as we speak to Gloria Lydia Damzungu on what best practices one can take on to have you know this many you know local breeds of chicken and make money out of them Damzungu's journey is quite exceptional in the sense that as a professional accountant she swiftly transitioned into the world of poultry farming in just one year her flock of local chicken breeds has exceeded 600 a rather unusual choice today considering that many farmers tend to focus on raising croilers broilers and layers Damzungu's journey to achieve significant success and earnings from her local breed venture the question that arises is how did she make this transition every occupation requires you possess a specific level of knowledge and in some cases this might necessitate further education to enhance your understanding of the industry however what exactly is Damzungu's story my name is Lydia Gloria Damzungu I'm a farmer here of local chicken that is caged I started the chicken business some time last year and um I have about 500 plus chicken which gives off eggs for reproduction that is hatching to get other chicks and then we also have chicken for eating I started the chicken business some time last year and um I have about 500 plus chicken which gives off eggs for reproduction that is hatching to get other chicks and then uh we also have um chicken for eating especially the cooks so I'll be taking you around to see what we do uh because before you see many people do not believe that you can grow local chicken that is caged I was employed at the Theroma hardware as a procurement manager I was employed at the Theroma hardware as a procurement manager but I gave birth early 2020 and there about uh covid came in so I thought of something to do at home while I was nursing the child and also in the tough times I had to look around for something that would keep me busy so what was meant to keep me busy became has become a source of income or a source of uh livelihood yeah because many people uh were into um broilers layers which to me I felt I was too lazy to manage because they were a bit of hard work so I chose the local chicken first because many people love local chicken and uh it's rarely found in large quantities so I decided to venture into it so that I can be able to give something the market does not have well I'm educated well I'm educated at least the latest I know is that I did a master's in leadership and human relations um and I practiced for eight years plus um I do other things I'm into sports management I'm a sportswoman so that too is part of what I do but uh this started like uh uh you know keeping myself busy and then I thought oh maybe if I gave it a little more time I could be able to get better than being employed well before going to the farm I'll have to spray you because uh we are carriers of vectors from various places so before you enter the farm I need to spray you to disinfect you so that you do not bring any sickness to the chickens because they are sensitive biosecurity is of utmost importance when visiting Damizungu's farm despite the misconception that local chickens are immune to diseases affecting other breeds Damizungu leaves nothing to chance on her farm before entering her chicken farm you must first undergo a thorough disinfection process well um diseases are diseases they have no uh limit to who they attack even local chicken are attacked it's just that uh most times since they are on free range a chicken will just die and maybe someone may not even diagonalize why it has died because it's on free range but because these ones we walk in them we check on them we feed them you're able to see oh this one has flu and then you treat the flu so they also get attacked because most of all diseases are airborne yes so with birds in the air and even us the human beings going around and getting close to them they get sick so disinfecting is really preventive often as a foreign person has to come or myself and my attendant there's a certain substance we put in here it's called valkyo we mix it with water and then we spray to clean up the place to to for any viruses that may roam around that could easily affect the chicken this particular side we have the parent stock the first chickens we brought in when we were starting although the place is compartmentalized they are the parent stock we also have some um one mouth old chicks that will transition into you know when the parents are sold off but also we have a small dispensary where we keep the sick chickens and rehabilitate them until they are so the compartment has there are three compartments yes i'll be taking you just down here then up there i'll also tell you what is there Damzungu starts by guiding us to her poultry nursery where she explains how to manage it specifically for local breed chickens she also highlights the distinctions that set it apart from nurseries designed for other chicken breeds there are two hundred and five chicks um yeah one month and one week old exactly today because i brought them on the 17th of August the two hundred and five years old exactly the same as the two hundred and five years old now these ones um yeah local chicken as you can see i'm holding this one that is uh naked neck at least those ones are commonly believed they are local yes but um they are mixed uh they are mixed in the um in in in the breed in in in the breed in in the um you know the the their appearance because the parents are different chickens from different places and so as they give off the eggs we take them to the hatchery and uh when you bring them they they come and they will show you that oh so when you go to see the parent you'll be like oh i saw one that looks like the other one i saw one that looks here it's because they are mixed all in one place and so they give off the eggs and when they hatch this is what you get feeding plays a crucial role in poultry management especially when it comes to the care of young birds in this context we aim to explore damuzungu's approach of feeding these small local poultry breeds they uh their parents uh different uh design of appearance so that's how they end up looking like that you'll find those that uh um they they are like checkered brown black there are those that are dark black there are those that come out when they are white there are those white with a spread of black there are those that are gray there are those that have like tattered feathers like you know spiked spiked spiked feathers so they come in all various forms because they are local this is what you actually would go and see out there in the villages if you are looking for local chicken eggs we take them to the hatchery they are usually one week old when you take them to the hatchery it takes 21 days to hatch and then they come out so when they come you start day one you take care of them you give them some glucose to be able to be strong you feed them differently they get finer food which is a little lighter that they can be able to pick and eat you give them um water sometimes you put some glucose sometimes you just you can even give them local things like shigaj just to help them uh get the immunity to be able to withstand any sickness uh actually by three days they have got feathers yes they they buy about three days one week they have feathers so you they are not so delicate you but generally all chickens when they have just um one day you we we don't give them husks we put them on boxes so they start on boxes after three days or one week you withdraw the boxes you put for them warmth but after two weeks you you stop putting the the pot the pot provide warmth and they are the moment they get feathers usually one week two weeks they have feathers they are able to warm themselves and be by themselves so their delicateness is managing the first one or two weeks the first one or two weeks that no sickness attacks them because chicken communicates their sickness through how they look their appearance or the the poop they they give off the moment you are able to take care of those two then you are able to bring them up to this level it can be uh hard but um when you have mastered uh the art for uh for some time you are able to read certain signs that show there's a problem here during this phase farmers experience the highest chicken losses primarily due to the numerous challenges they encounter we attempted to investigate the situation with local breeds and identify the key difficulties they face during this critical stage when i was starting i used to give pellets you know it's the common uh the ideal thing to do but for us we we get concentrates and then also do we have maize uh we have a small place where we grow some maize so we when we go to the chicken feed place we just take maize uh adding some concentrate as for the cheeks and then the measurements must be right for you to be able to feed them yeah now these young ones usually eat a little more maize because maize has a bit of uh uh the nutrients they need to grow to be strong but also to put on weight so yeah they they you have to be specific on the the ratios on the maize uh and the concentrate and other things that may be required sometimes you put toxin binders so that you know when they eat the food they're able to process it in their stomach and it doesn't uh cause them constipation yes the last stage is a little better the stage that you staff is usually one week to one month they usually should not be in a cold place that's why you you will notice people give worms in form of bulbs there are even some new machines that have come up for me i use pots i just place spots depending on how many chicks i have i put the pots and they are able to find the worms and when they find worms even when you enter the room where they are you'll find them everyone is sleeping in any hauli anywhere because their place is warm but the warmth also has to be regulated that is why you find people not sleeping in the first days because they could even maybe the warmth may increase in the night and for them they are sleeping near the port you need to wake them up to go away or they may sleep it may be too cold they may cringe on each other and end up suffocating so it's about regulating every good thing you put there then also the food has to be good enough not to cause diarrhea or constipation then supplements you give some new vitamins to help boost their immunity but if you can deal with coldness and also optimistic sicknesses that may come and then controlling your cleanliness general yeah because if you have older chickens you go work on the older chickens and then you come and you may transfer sickness from the older chickens to the young ones so you have to be during my visit to the farm i was taken aback by the price of one month old local breed chicken which stands at 10 000 shillings when comparing this course to that of other breeds it appears to be quite steep this raised the question in my mind why do we opt for raising local breeds over exotic ones in poultry farming math old we sell them at 8 000 those that are um one day old we sell them at 2 500. 2 500 are cheap 10 000 yes we do yes we do yes we do yes we do they do at 10 000 because the the cost is that the first one month is very delicate the feeding is different the vaccination so their costs attached to why it ends up being 10 000. um you have to give them warmth you have to to to usually get a bit of costeosis depending on the spacing and many challenges because you know chicken eat their poop for example they could the one may come when it is already diseased so you have to treat so now when when you i mean all that is money and the time to care for them because they are very engaging in the first one month especially the first two weeks it's very engaging so uh this is uh yeah this is uh some this is someone's uh chicken uh wants to take them at two months so that's well not really but it said it will be negotiated at that point but he already knows he has to pay 10 000 plus no we sometimes have concessions because like this one who is taking his 200 has already taken 200 so is our is our daily like we will always be buying at some point so you know you give some discounts here and there but we inquired from damizungu whether she encounters any fatalities at this point some of them can you may not even find an explanation like you can realize they are squeezed there maybe it can get suffocated then also noticing a certain sicknesses especially flu can really kill them because until you pick a cheek and you shake in the nose or the mouth to see the mucus you will not know it has flu uh the older ones you'll hear them maybe uh sneezing or um um as if snoring then you know ah there's a problem but for these young ones you may just see them you know uh um like as if someone wearing a coat and looking a bit miserable that's when you notice oh there's a problem that's when you notice that you're not going to see them so diagnosing the sickness at uh at an early stage can limit because by the time i brought this there were 210 now they are about 205 that means five of them have died some of them um they can't fix themselves in like a small place and they if you you're not nearby to see you will find when it is gone so some some some deaths um are explainable but some can be sickness related some accidents in the next episode of the harvest money show we will further explore damuzungu's journey as she manages the different stages of her local chicken breeds we will dive into her monthly egg production and earnings from her farm this will help us to determine if it is a worthwhile endeavor compared to raising exotic breeds such as the croilers broilers and the layers well i must say i'm very much blown away by this story by gloria lydia damuzungu and how she has managed to keep this local breeds of chicken and make money out of it here in the ugandan market where we are so much used to the modern breeds of chicken that is the broilers the cruellers and the layers making quick money out of them but she has shared you know her insight on how she has managed to keep this local breeds she actually says you can actually keep this local breed in a way that is quite modern and even make more money out of the local breeds of chicken and gloria is not doing this thing alone she's doing this thing alongside you know other you know other ventures that she's she finds herself in you know she is a masters holder and she is also the assistant secretary general at the uganda olympic committee so it's not just one thing that she's doing she's doing so many other things but it shows you that she also you know loves or she has passion for agriculture that is a very you know big industry that brings for most people money so we shall be having more of this conversation with gloria lydia damuzungu in our next episode of the harvest money show she'll be sharing with you how you can keep these chickens keep them away from disease because they're prone to disease but she has found a way of managing you you know these diseases and these are practices that you can also emulate and be able to keep you know local breeds of chickens in your home spaces and make money out of it so that has it that has been it for the harvest money show this week until next time goodbye
