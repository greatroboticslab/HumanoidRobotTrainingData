 Welcome to the vast fields of the United States, where over four billion pounds of watermelons are harvested each year, making this country one of the world's top watermelon producers. From tiny seeds, through the dedicated care of farmers, watermelons have become the symbol of summer, bringing joy and refreshment to millions of people around the world. Join us as we explore the miraculous journey of the watermelon, from seed to the ripe fruit on your table. It all starts with tiny seeds, carefully selected from the best watermelon varieties. In the United States, millions of these seeds will grow into healthy watermelon plants, ready for a bountiful harvest. In just a few days, from those tiny seeds, green shoots begin to emerge. This is a critical phase, where watermelon plants need to be nurtured with care to ensure strong growth. But good seeds are just the beginning. The soil must be meticulously prepared. Across 130,000 acres of land, equivalent to over 100,000 football fields, farmers fill the soil, making it loose and fertile. The soil needs to be just right, providing the roots with the perfect environment to grow strong. And then, the newly sprouted seedlings are planted into the soil, each carefully spaced to give them room to grow. With the help of modern machinery, each seedling is precisely placed into the pre-prepared furrows, saving the farmers both time and effort. Afterward, a thin layer of soil is gently applied, retaining moisture and protecting the young plants from environmental elements. Even though the planting process has become more efficient with technology, the farmers' meticulous care and dedication remain evident in every step. They don't just see seedlings, they see the promise of the upcoming harvest. Each seedling carries the farmers' hope, ready to take root and grow into vibrant watermelon plants, bearing the dream of a bountiful harvest. The 20th year's peak, are now yang only raised to 4 เส環ado first. After 40-50 days from sowing, the watermelon plants begin to flower. The bright yellow blossoms signal the arrival of the first watermelons. This is the most critical period in the development process, where farmers must closely monitor and carefully adjust the amount of water and fertilizer. In the United States, a variety of watermelon types are grown, each offering unique characteristics in flavor, color and size. Each forming watermelon brings us one step closer to the harvest season. After about 90-120 days from planting, the ripe, juicy watermelons are ready for harvest. With over 4 billion pounds harvested each year, the United States is not only one of the largest producers of watermelons in the world, but also the home of some of the finest watermelons. Farmers have developed special techniques to determine the perfect time to harvest. They lightly tap the rind, listening for that distinct sound. Only when the sound is deep and the rind is taut is the fruit ready to be picked. The harvest itself is a well-coordinated dance. Picture this. Once the watermelon is deemed ready, a farmer expertly slices it from the vine and with a quick practiced motion heaves it up into the air. Waiting on the back of a truck, another farmer with the skill of a seasoned outfielder catches it mid-air and places it gently in the truck bed. This back and forth continues as the truck slowly moves through the field, with each watermelon tossed and caught with the same precision and care. It's a lively and efficient process, filled with shouts of encouragement and laughter, as the team works together to gather the fruits of their labor. Every harvested watermelon represents not just hard work, but also the camaraderie and deep love for farming that these farmers share. After being harvested, the ripe watermelons are transported to processing for facilities. Here, they undergo rigorous quality checks to ensure the highest standards before being packaged and shipped nationwide and beyond. In just two to five days, these watermelons from the fields of the United States arrive on your table, bringing the fresh, sweet taste of summer. The US exports watermelons mainly to Canada and some markets in Europe and Asia, contributing significantly to the global watermelon supply. The future of the US watermelon industry is looking brighter. With technological advancements and sustainable farming practices, the United States is poised to increase both production and quality to meet the growing global demand. American scientists and farmers are continuously researching and developing new watermelon varieties, from seedless to thin rind watermelons, to provide the best experience for consumers. The goal in the future is to maintain high standards and explore new markets, solidifying US watermelons as a symbol of quality and flavor. With each passing season, the US watermelon industry continues to rise, constantly innovating and expanding. From vast fields to the sweet watermelons on your table, this journey is not just the story of farmers, but also a symbol of progress and hope for the future. Enjoy a slice of watermelon and you will taste not only the sweetness, but also the love and dedication in every fruit. you
