 And they say, oh, Dwayne in Dakota, the cows have no legs. I always tell the story of my South American friends coming to South Dakota and seeing all the balers we use here, because that's a very predominant thing to do is to bale hay up and move it into the feedlot for the wintertime. And they would see that and they say, oh, Dwayne in Dakota, the cows have no legs. Meaning that the cows should be able to walk out and get their own food. And I think that's exactly right. It just saves us a lot of money and it keeps us from hauling nutrients back and forth. How many pounds of nutrients go to that feedlot? Well, they don't really get back. The nitrogen for sure doesn't get back. And if we take the manure in the form of getting the phosphorus and potassium back, yeah, that kind of works. But it, again, is another fossil fuel thing. So we're trying to take the fossil fuel guy out of it.
