 We are big on safety. Every tractor needs it. They come out of the factory too light. Well, except for the Summit TX25 that comes standard with RimGuard in its rear tires. RimGuard is a non-toxic, non-corrosive beet juice byproduct. It's not going to freeze on you good to minus 35 degrees Fahrenheit at 10.7 pounds per gallon. It's the heaviest natural liquid ballast on the market today. I love the fact that this is invisible. It's stored inside the tires. It's there all the time. So if you forget to put anything on your three-point, you're still going to be set up safely. RimGuard liquid ballast is going to help keep you planted to the ground. This keeps you safe as an operator, keeps you more efficient when you're using your front-end loader, and puts more power to the ground when you need it. Now, if you don't have a Summit TX25 and you need to add RimGuard to your tires, you'll find it at over a thousand dealers nationwide. Visit RimGuardSolutions.com to find a dealer near you.
