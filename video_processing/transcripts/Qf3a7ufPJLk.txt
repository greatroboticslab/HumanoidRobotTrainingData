 Composting has deep historical roots, tracing back to ancient civilizations. The Romans, for example, recognized the value of organic waste, utilizing animal manures and plant residues to enrich their soils. Similarly, ancient Chinese agricultural texts emphasized compost as a vital component for productive farming. In the Americas, indigenous cultures practiced composting by intermixing crops with organic waste, enhancing soil fertility. These early techniques showcased an understanding of nutrient recycling that is crucial today. By examining the practices of these societies, we appreciate how composting laid the foundation for sustainable agriculture, influencing modern methods to combat waste and improve soil health.
