Howto & Style
 Hey guys it's Farmer Brad and I'm going to take you along for my morning chores. I'm going to grab some breakfast first. My go-to breakfast cereal is mini frozen beets. It's the best of both worlds. You got your sweet side and you got your regular side. Okay so first up got the hair of the meat birds. A bag of feed. So on the farm here I pretty much measure feed out by the two gallon bucket. The most common automatic chicken water bucket I make is the two gallon version. And it works well for measuring out the feed. I usually tell myself is this a one bucket or two bucket operation. I'm going to go ahead and move this chicken tractor. What are you going to do during seconds is the fourенные Cabin Carap plant. Maybe one's going to be easy. Then maybe one bucket has dropped at a bottom of a three再見 side. Or is it going to go back to your rear нед Sierra? Sometimes you might take you know what觉得 place is qued Terra, but that reminds me of a einen stock in theло. I think you got out of my estimated もね. Ready when you eat husbands, we're crying because vår Sugarmadı, I'm noticing that Whitepack isatured to run myself into two recordingara. I'm sure an neural band is sensitive to trava hard. Now onto the other chicken tractor. Now right behind me is the main flaw. Now they are taking care of the water. They have the automatic chicken water bucket right there. And then they have a lot of feed in the inside that I only have to fill it up like maybe every two weeks. And then over here I have some juveniles that are growing up and they are taking care of with the automatic chicken water. And then up in here I have the feeder. And then I just got to finish putting the other water in the front chicken tractor. And I almost forgot to show you the baby chicks. So last Friday we received 161 baby chicks. And now we are down to 150, let's see, 156. Here they are. Well review it. I'm going to make a kesout. Alright. But there are ones that may beburden. Thanks for coming along to my morning chores. Hope you enjoyed the video and hope you have an excellent day. Bye. Bye.
