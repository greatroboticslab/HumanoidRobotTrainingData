 I'm here outside the front of Gainter Welding Works in a Gearing. You guessed it, I'm in Gainter and it's a warm day out here. But my gosh can this business turn some work in. They do all the work for about 100 kilometres. There's no other workshop within Kui this place. So they have everything from the councils, the Ergon Power Suppliers, any of the major players, but most of their work comes from the citrus industry and farms around the area. And this place has got a mountain of machinery. There's absolutely everything that you can look for in regards to welding and fabricating. These guys will build everything as you can see from here. You've got tractor slashes, pump rebuilds, they do a massive amount of hydraulics, a lot of particularly specialised ladders for the citrus industry that is transported overseas and all the way up to Tully. It's a massive business, so give me a call if you're interested.
