 In this video, you will learn how to make a very basic biochar fertilizer. This fertilizer will work well with soil conditions and crops common in North Thailand, but also in Southeast Asia in general. You will need a hoe, urine, EM, 20 kilograms of rich soil, preferably inoculated with mycorrhiza, 20 kilograms of dried manure, that's about two large rice bags, 20 kilograms of biochar, that's roughly three large rice bags. Choose a flat, hard surface and cover it with heavy construction plastic. Empty the three bags of biochar into the center of the plastic. Using a simple watering can or just a bucket, put the urine all over the biochar. Lots of it. Spread the two bags of dried manure on top of the biochar. Pour more urine on top of that. Top the pile with a bag of soil. Sprinkle even more urine. On top of that, begin to mix your ingredients together. Urine. You should start to leak out the bottom. When it does, mix some more. Stop when you think that the pile will absorb no more urine. You want as much urine. Your fertilizer is possible because it has lots of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. Fill your watering can with EM and sprinkle EM all over while you keep mixing. You can learn about EM in the two Warm Heart videos, Making EM Solution and Using EM. Cover the finished biochar fertilizer mix and trench around it to protect it from rain. After three months, you will have a rich, powerful fertilizer. In our experiments, this fertilizer performed as well as your standard NPK, and it's free. It also restores the natural fertility of your soil. And biochar fertilizer traps pesticide leftovers so they do not end up in your fruits and vegetables where they can poison you and your family.
