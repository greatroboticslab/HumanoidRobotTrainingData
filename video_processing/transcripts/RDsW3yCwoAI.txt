 In the heart of Vermont circa 900 AD, the Abenaki people achieved a remarkable agricultural breakthrough. They began cultivating the three sisters, corn, beans, and squash, together in a symbiotic planting method. This innovation not only enhanced soil fertility, but also provided a balanced diet sustaining their communities. How did this trio work together? Corn provided a natural trellis for beans. Beans fixed nitrogen in the soil, and squash's broad leaves suppressed weeds. This ingenious practice laid the foundation for sustainable farming in the region. See the description below.
