 Good morning. I just cleared that area to get rid of the ragweed. There's a lot more I could do, but we finally got a cloudy day. It's not extremely hot, so I figured my energy would be better spent attacking what has become of my garden. Because I would like to, I mean my goal is it starts to cool down next week, so my goal is I'd like to have everything planted for a fall garden by the end of next week. So I'm just going to start chipping away. I don't hit any hot patches or rough patches and I can get it all done. Here it is. Okay, so I got the first bed pretty much weeded. I'm going to rake it a little bit and then I'm going to plant some romaine, some green towers. I got them pelleted so I'm going to attempt to use the Earthway seeder, a seeder for the first time. So we'll see how that goes. Little nervous because obviously like, you know, once the seeds are out, they're kind of out. So you only get one first shot. But I don't think it's too hard. I don't know. I'll watch a few videos on it. I'm going to try the first shot. I'll watch a few videos. I'll watch a few videos on it. I'll watch a few videos on it. I'll watch a few videos on it. And when I'm watching a video on it, I'll watch a few videos on it. Thank you. Thank you. Somewhere along the line, my blank irrigation got a little bit tangled. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. got those rigged up. I'm a little worried because the adapter that holds the wobbler, they said fit a half inch blank poly, but I had to kind of cut it a little bit. So I don't know how those will hold up. One's kind of leaning a little bit. Also, I don't remember, I calculated it when I bought it. That was back in June, so I don't remember how far I had to put them apart to cover what I want to cover. I think they need to be a row over, but I'll worry about that. I'm just trying to water the one row right now. And there's really no way to test them because I'm using a three-way to get to the next one. So there's really no way to test it without having the next one hook up. So I don't know. I guess we're going blind, but my goal is to really attack my irrigation end of fall, mid-fall, right before it snows, probably end of October, because everything will be died back. And I won't have a lot of other things to do, so I can stake it out and at least run some things so I can get at it in the spring. But anyway, we'll see what happens when I throw around. And they work, so that's pretty cool. I'm going to hang out for a little while, probably run them for about 10 minutes and then just kind of see if, I don't know, I guess if they're too far apart or whatnot. I definitely need to move them over a row, but I already knew that. So I probably won't do that until I plant the other row. But that's an easy fix. After watching them for a while, I think I'm good with space. I'll probably have to go three a row though. But I think I can get away with moving them over two rows. So I might only, I might need less that way than I thought at first. So it might actually work out. But I'm just going to keep putting them up slowly and then, you know, as I need to get them closer together, I'll get them closer together. It's only two bucks a sprinkler, so it's really not that big of a deal. Anyway, take it easy. Appreciate you hanging out. Catch you later.
