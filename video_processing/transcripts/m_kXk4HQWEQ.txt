 Hey good-o guys it's Wayne Perkins here we're at the Otago field days in Otago funny that and it's a cloudy day but we're here with the solar water pump the react pump and pumping well it's done about two and a half thousand litres so far for the day we've got two panels set up behind it just want to give you a little bit of information about the react pump it's capable of pumping up to about 10,000 litres a day maybe a little bit more depending on what we do with it and on the height so that's a pretty good quantity and it's capable of pumping to about 150 meter head we can go higher than that but the standard model here will pump up to about 150 meter head that's kind of based on the amount of water is based on how high we need to pump it a few options with it we basically this is the two panel system we can put four panels on it or six panels which basically maximizes the amount of water you can get out of it so the two panel system it'll pump it'll pump that 150 meter head but it's gonna struggle on the cloudy days or days that aren't so good so with with four panel system what we're doing is we are we're giving you more water on the good days but we're giving you a lot more water on the bad days we just got a lot more we can grab a lot more power from the sky so hey look if you're interested if you need to get water to your stock on your farm or whatever you know keen to have a chat to you just give me a call love to hear from you and we want we want to go through and we want to talk through the process with you we what we're going to want to know how high you need to pump the water you're going to want to need know over what distance and on average per day how much water you need and out of that there we'll start working with you and figuring out whether this pump or one of one of our other pumps will do the job here so um if you're in the market for some stock water and you haven't got any electricity give me a call love to hear from you
