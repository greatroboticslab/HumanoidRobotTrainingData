 Wear extra protection when mixing and loading pesticides. Use an apron over your protective equipment. You need to wear protective eyewear too. Carefully open paper and cardboard pesticide containers. If you rip them open, dust can fly out and get on your skin and into your eyes, your mouth and lungs. Instead, put the pesticide container on a low, flat surface. Use a sharp knife or scissors. Then wash the knife or scissors with soap and water before using them again and use them only for opening pesticide containers. Follow the label directions to find out how much pesticide you need and then measure it carefully. Pour liquids carefully to avoid splashes. Be sure your face and eyes are well above the container while you are pouring.
