 More than just a textile, cotton is a culture and a way of life for hundreds of millions of households worldwide. Cotton creates jobs and incomes for millions at the heart of the supply chain. 80% of cotton is used in the apparel sector, but all parts of the cotton plant can be used to produce food, feed and energy. Cotton's diverse uses create high value opportunities for smallholders, women and young people, boosting livelihoods and contributing to food security. Together, we and our partners spend no efforts to make cotton farming more competitive. For the cotton industry to thrive, we support small business ecosystems and promote innovative technology. We foster sustainable farming practices and boost employment. We work alongside producers to add value, create jobs and reduce the effects of climate change. We improve farmers' livelihoods by strengthening cotton value chains, value addition and trade. We oversee a rules-based global trade, pursuing a more transparent and fairer international cotton trade. Together, we celebrate World Cotton Day, renewing our commitment to this precious resource and reaffirming cotton's role in achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. We bless you guys next week. Now Red Team plains to build a business of Free Chinamaya IO,
