Basically, she is talking about water logging and water injection process. She is saying at least this amount of water comes in the initial period. Then it comes up to this level of initial period. That's the monsoon progresses. And it gets refilled 3-4 times. So much of water goes inside. And the catchment area for this bhoongaroo is? The catchment area of this bhoongaroo is the revolut channel. So it is more than 20 acres. More than 20 acres land. And this 20 acres land is collectively owned by the 7 women. No, irrigation is taking place for 50 acres. 50 acres, 50 vigors of land. It's 20 acres of land. Yeah. 50 vigors. 7 women together. All below poverty line women. Okay. And this is the first time they are doing this irrigation. Earlier they are going for the migration walk. Okay. Now this time they are doing. The last, whenever bhoongaroo they got, they go for the irrigation. Okay… So, a акку study that they are going around which the minimum bhoongaroo Bah so that you'll decide For the��? So, what would they do to consider? Now they should find our water finding at mentions? 1 pound. And then these days they are using 50 acres of centuries. Wow. They should pass digging in to the impact. How can I do that too? That is it.เรины are 50 acres in O imageran, And these � пока is 20 acres and years ahead Cadrupal Sea fromém. While it is発生ed in등 there. Like they have been 24 acres I'm not sure, but I'm not sure. I'm not sure. How do you prepare? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. If you're 10,000 people, then what do you do? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. So they have an alternative system. 8th year pass, they're busy. Every 7th day you get the turn. So whatever the crop, they have decided. Based upon that, they decide upon the irrigation process. And also the term of irrigation, the duration of irrigation. Then one by one, on the 6th, 7th day you get the turn. But they all discuss that and collectively arrive. Everyone sit together and decide upon it. Okay. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. She's saying there's so much water. If you can give us more machines, we can irrigate so much of land over here. There's so much potential over here. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

So quickly, if you can add in these details, there's one diesel engine, and a pump here, that extracts the water. How many HP is this diesel engine? 8 HP. And this pump. So around how much diesel is used for all the pumping in a season? In one season approximately? Approximately cost us 20,000 to 25,000. The diesel? Diesel cost. So that's how many liters are around here? Okay. For one season? For around 20 acres? For 20 acres, yeah. Okay. Thanks Biplam. For 20 acres using the waterine and the energy opened to 20 acres in 50 acres walk. In 50 acres,
