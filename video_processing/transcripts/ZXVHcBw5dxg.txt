 Regenerative agriculture is a holistic farming approach that focuses on restoring soil health and biodiversity while reducing carbon emissions. It builds resilience against climate change by enhancing natural processes such as carbon sequestration and water retention. Techniques include cover cropping, crop rotation, and reduced tillage, all aimed at improving soil structure and enhancing ecosystems. Its goal is to regenerate not just sustain the environment, offering a solution to both food security and climate change.
