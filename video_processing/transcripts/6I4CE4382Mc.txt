 Whoops! It's just so hard. We're going a little slower today. I feel like I'm crawling, y'all. You broke a belt? You don't even have two belts on the ground. One sad sight. I got to go ahead and take it over a notch. $400 for a belt? You got it, baby. So I can buy that tractor you want. Buy another tractor. Yeah. Yeah. Eat up, girls. I mean, boys. Boys. Boys. This is the boys. Water is leaking somewhere. Water is leaking somewhere. Water is leaking somewhere. Still missing your babies, huh? Even after three days? Still missing your babies, huh? Even after three days? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. What? What? What? Why are you coming up here, panda? I just fed y'all. Go back and eat your breakfast. You're not going out. And you're not going in there with those babies. No. Curious things. Whoops. Whoops. I forgot to shut that gate. That's why those heifers came out. Got it. As Lawrence says, they have the border collie syndrome. And they just can't help but try to herd something. And it's super annoying sometimes. Okay. Let's see. We're spinning. I don't know. There's literally nothing I can do with a 2,000-pound bale. Okay. Well, that didn't work. Go get the other tractor. Just kidding again. He's going to get the backhoe, which is over here, so we don't have to go home to get the other tractor. These dogs, though. These dogs. Oh. Thought I had something on my neck there. Oh. Said he should have put that over here to start with on this side. So they have access to both of these. And they have access to underneath there for shade. And they have water. Anyway, there's more room over here. So we shouldn't have put it where the trough was. But, anywho. Here we go. Oh, golly. We're watching calves. Watching dogs. Watching the hay. Make sure they don't get out. Roll on, buddy. Roll on. Come here, guys. It's pretty good. Not quite far enough. Oh, golly. Get cut. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. She's trying hard to be good, but it's so hard. It's just so hard. I just have to get a little nip. Oh, boy. Here we go. I feel like I've been running a race all morning just trying to get stuff done. Before heading out, we hear Lawrence and Wesley. Hold on. I've spent all the morning getting everything greased and hooked up, so here we go. Wesley's bringing twine to leave of the field. Here's hoping that it breaks down and we can get all this done before dark. Here we are. Thirsty Beans again. Still my rank. There's my boy. My boy with the twine and the puppy dolls. Woo! Bumpy bumpy. Bye. Good boy. Sweet boy. So that's been cut. Looks bad on it. Thanks. We'll probably bail that when the next time. We'll see you. We'll see you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Don't panic. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Hello. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. down and out it would help if I actually pulled the lever back alright we'll try that let's see this dust is really thick so we're just going to have to see how it goes and I'm going to have to probably I'm going to rake slower than normal because he's going to have to go slow or he's going to be going slower and he's going to be tying a lot more than we've been used to because we've got more hay so he told me to start in 5th like normal and after he tied the first fell to knock it down to 4th he stayed about 1500 RPM a lot of times I rake in 5th at 2000 RPM so we're going to go a little slower today he's going to be slower today you already tying? oh no he's just waiting on me alright well he's tying I'm going to slow down and let her eat oh my gosh I feel like I'm crawling y'all oh no oh no I really feel like I'm crawling this is going to be a long day I need an audio book or something I have no service down here so I can't I can't even like listen to a podcast or because I didn't think ahead to download anything I can't listen to the music I doubt the radio works actually well I think it does ok but the AC works that's good and I've got some things I need to think about for a project so maybe I'll dictate to my phone and take some notes that way and then again some idle time doing this it's really not so bad of a thing still tracking therapy I'm not sure you can understand me I'm not sure I said I slowed down I'm in 4th at 1600 RPM so you want me to speed up and then you're stopping again on the home you broke a belt? I don't know y'all we don't even have two belts on the ground and I can't help you 3 oh my gosh you gotta be kidding me do you need me to come back there? alright you have to go and try her y'all That hurts my feelings Sometimes it just It seems like everything gets stuck Alright you just want me to hang out here You just want me to stay here I gotta go Okay All that's not lost Because we have another baler And this is why we have two balers When something like this happens But it's going to take a while for him to go back It's going to take a while for him to go back It's going to take a while for him to go back It's going to take a while for him to go back It's going to take a while for him to go back Get unhooked Grease the other one Get it hooked up I'm looking at a lot of down time right here In the middle of a really hot field In the air It's working It's not rolling because I'm not rolling This is not ideal This is not ideal This is not ideal today This is not ideal today Trying to find a silver lining The silver lining Where are the silver lining? I do have another baler So we will get to get Get something done I do have air conditioning I'm not sitting on the 4320 like I used to Without any air I'm having to wait in the field for him to go get another baler Because I have done that before I'm thinking I didn't bring any snacks But I did eat lunch So that's good I do have water I do have water Oh, what a mess Cougs even left He kicked out the veil that was partially wrapped Oh, what a mess Cougs even left He kicked out the veil that was partially wrapped This is what we're doing y'all This is what we're doing and I could just sit here and run my mouth off for a while talking about nothing, but I'll stop that for now, so I'll let you know when we're back and rolling. I heard him trying to come on the radio. It's been, uh, like an hour and 20 minutes or so. I don't see him yet, but maybe that means he's in route and route. I say route. You say route. Whatever. Maybe we'll be raking and rolling again soon. Do you see what I see? Woof woof. Yay. It's back. Now, let's hope and pray this bailer doesn't break because if it does, we're out of options. Here we go, kids. Alrighty then. Just a little two-hour break, that's all. I can't do it. I can't do it. Suck the rake in. Alright, he's getting out. I'm parking. I didn't understand everything he said, but I got the fact that he said he's going to try this. I came in a little bit. He's got to do something. So he said he wanted to get a bail. Then one bail in. And see from there. That's what I took. That to me. Well, he just got out with a wrench in his hand. I don't know what he's doing. Adjusting something. I just saw him on the phone and now he's calling me. Okay, my job is to watch these gauges. And if it gets out of the red, I blow the horn and tell him. He's working on a spring. There's something wrong with a spring. Oh. And he's got me doing the rows a little tighter because this bailer doesn't pick up as wide as the other one. So I found that out. So. Okay, Rita, let's do this. Let's do this. And hope we get done. And I'm going to have to keep a watch on the brakes because the hydraulics tend to leak. You can even see him bouncing a little bit. That middle part there. It'll go out and I need it to stay in. Oh. So. Bummy, bumpy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. Bummy. fuck. Bummy. Alright. Telled me to go faster. Bummy. What the hell? Bummy. You know what? Who you want me to do in a minute? What the hell? Bummy. National Pissie, Tolerun sanit throws your way. B mujahadayout. Bummy. Bummy. sure. We went the entire hay season last year without any problems with that baler. So, and we were very grateful for that. So, it was time for something to mess up. It was this time. My sweet boy just came down. I thought I was recording, but I wasn't. His daddy, and Lawrence forgot to put the oil in the baler. So, Wesley brought it to him. He's a good kid, I tell you. He's a good kid. I was just thinking about how good a kid he is. Both our kids are good. Wesley has a heart of gold. He's a worker. He's a doer. You don't have to ask him more than once to do anything. He's just a good kid. I love my boy. From flooded grounds to dusty grounds. Just like that. That's the way that goes. Four miles an hour. Rolling. I mean, raven. And even at four miles an hour, I'm beating the fool out of him. Only because he has to stop so often. We're going to have a lot of bells out here when this is said and done, y'all. A lot, a lot, a lot of baby bells. Oh, wow, y'all. Well, looky there. There is the hay bale with all the belts on it. It wasn't three. It was four. It looks like four to me. Oh, my gosh. That is one sad sight. Oh, boy. trix from the입니다. Near the day. TJXM members said that stupidity vlog weg interview with all violence and calamity rise and intensity हAD Other than the time that we used a friend's wrapping, uh, hate wrapping equipment. The plastic wrap. Anyway, that's awesome. So that's going to help us get out of here before dark 30, I hope. How many times in one video can I do this? I don't know. Somebody count. Here comes Bobby. Yeah, very good. Our boy is back with more twine and maybe some snacks for me. I don't know if he got my message in time. I forgot to bring snacks. My stomach is telling me it's hungry.
