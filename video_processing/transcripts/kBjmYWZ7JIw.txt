Free and semi-free range Free range is where the chickens are left free to eat worms, insects, grasses and leaves around the farm. 7. Semi-free range is where birds are put in an enclosed place for some time and given food. 8. They are then allowed to roam outside to eat worms, insects, grasses and leaves around the farm. 8. This is my personal favourite. So you know. 9. Second Fold Unit System This is also known as a chicken tractor. Birds are kept in a small, moveable house made out of wire mesh, big enough for the chickens to move around. 9. This house is moved from one spot to another every day. This system is best suited to small-scale operations and chicken vendors. 9. Third Small-scale Confined System This is also known as the deep litter system. 10. The chicken house is made of concrete floors but covered with litter, wood shavings that is, to make birds feel comfortable. 10. The house is big to allow the chickens to move freely. 11. Food and water are provided inside the house. It is expensive but the best for commercial chicken farming. 11. Chicken equipment, both drinkers and feeders, should always be kept clean and well maintained. 12. This will prevent cases of diseases in your chicken. These are the equipments required to raise 100 chicks comfortably. 12. Feeders One feeder for every 50-day-old chicks, cleaned and disinfected, all with fresh starter feed. 13. Drinkers Use 6L or 10L drinkers What are features of a good drinker? 14. Has a twist lock system and a hanger or carry handle. Easy to fill, easy to clean. 15. Drinkers come in different sizes 1L, 6L and 10L. Choose as it fits. 15. Litter Use wood shavings or rice husks, not sawdust as chicks can choke. Spread evenly to a depth of 5-10cm. The litter should be soft and dry. 16. Heat source Ensure that you have a source of heat, like a brooder Gico, and it is working well. Maintain a good temperature for your birds. 16. Light Light The idea is to provide 23 hours of light for the first 7 days, as this dramatically improves chick development. 16. Brooder Guards Round plywood is used to make the brooding area 1.5m2 per 50 chicks. The area is cleaned, disinfected and with well-spread, fresh litter. 17. Cover this area with paper and remove after 3 days. 18. Looking to dive even deeper? Get our full Eggspurt guide packed with all the details. It's a cluckin' great deal. 18.

Hatching own chicks Mother hen sits on eggs for 21 days, to keep them warm until they hatch. This is a natural process. She can sit and incubate her own eggs or those of another hen. It's the simplest way of hatching a small number of eggs. I prefer giving one hen only 8 eggs to hatch. You have almost 100% hatch rate. 19. 2. Artificial brooding Incubating machines are used to hatch eggs into chicks. It's mostly used by farmers, who are in the business of selling day-old chicks or keeping many birds. It hatches many eggs at once. 19. 3. Buying day-old chicks from hatcheries You can buy day-old chicks from hatcheries directly and start brooding the chickens on your farm. 20. Identify registered hatcheries or chick nurseries to buy day-old chicks. 21. Select hatcheries that vaccinate chicks against Marek's disease. 22. Brooding is a period right after the chicks have hatched and special care and attention is needed to support their health and survival because hatched chicks can't control their own body temperature in the first weeks. You need to provide extra heat. Otherwise chicks will be too cold and may not eat well, drink enough or may even die. 21. Traditional brooding Here brooding is done by the mother chicken. She covers the young ones with her wings to keep them warm. 22. Artificial brooding When there is no mother hen to look after her chicks, you need to set up an artificial brooder. 23. During the first 2-3 weeks, chicks need to be kept in a brooder as they cannot control their own body temperature yet. 24. You need to give them special care to support their health and survival. 25. Artificial heat helps keep chicks stay warm until the feathers grow. Heat can be provided by using a brooding Gico, gas or electricity. 25. Remember, without the extra warmth, chicks can easily feel cold and may not eat or drink enough and their digestive organs may not develop properly. 26. Improved Kiyoneji chickens need feed that contains the following. 1. Energy 2. Protein 3. Vitamins 4. Minerals 5. Water Feed requirement is dependent on the age and status of the birds. Chicks, growers, layers, meat birds and broody hens. There are different types of chicken feed for the different age categories, as I am about to discuss. 6. Chicks below the age of 8 weeks feed them with chick mash as it provides high protein quantities. 7. Chicks between the age of 8 and 18 weeks feed them with growers mash to provide a balanced diet so that the chicks can gain weight fast. 8. When the chicks start laying, feed them layers mash. This will provide needed nutrients to improve egg production. 8. Good practices to protect your chicken against disease and enemies. 9. Only allow essential staff to enter the chicken house. 9. Place a footbath with a disinfectant like cooperside outside the chicken house. 10. Each person working in the house should have their own special pair of gumboots that they wear when entering the house. 11. Remove old litter, dirty bags and rubbish away from the house. 12. Throw away old feed as they may have moulds or produce toxins. 13. Keep birds of the same age together to reduce disease outbreaks. 14. Ensure no rodents or wild animals can enter the house. 15. Regularly clean and dry all equipment. 15. Thanks for watching. If you found this video helpful, don't forget to subscribe. And hey, if you subscribe today, we might just send you a virtual egg.
