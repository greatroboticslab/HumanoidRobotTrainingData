Howto & Style
 I said if you'd fly Just where it was needed Cleanly black as night Coins that eat just as dead In the iron town Nobody is losing Faces will change But your face remains the same Spiders will be here by dark When we're finally sober They'll be gone The trees will bloom The nights will melt We'll always remember How it felt The night Ourï¿½ï¿½ so that was actually filmed about three weeks ago and yeah i'm trying to film everything a little bit earlier so that i can schedule a video and get a video out every friday so that's what i'm aiming for hopefully that'll happen yeah but uh since since all that was filmed it's actually dried out here a hell of a lot all the mats have dried out including the path and i've moved the electric fence that was all the way down there so that they could have that area and i've moved it over here so that i can protect this bit of land here and just let that grass recover a little bit i don't think we're gonna have to lift the patio area i don't think those mats are gonna need re-leveling or anything because they're fine but the path yeah the path is a little bit higgledy piggledy as you can see it all sort of goes a little bit up at the edges and down at other edges and it's not very flat so yeah i do think i'm gonna have to take that up but what i'm gonna show you first is how simon and bruce fix the rails that hope had broken on our main paddock area around the caravan that one's all right look at that shading straight up oh yeah there we go does it fit does it fit You know the idea of that hammer? It's called the pin hammer. What you do is you've got a little staple in between your fingers. See? You can hit in between your fingers without bashing your fingers. So you start it off like that and then turn it round and knock it. Did you bring a nail with you? I did not. Staple. Can't get to them now, can you? Well I can't imagine the staple in place. You've got to give me the stuff to use. You need the pliers as well. You're not going to bash my fingers are you? Well I can't because you're using that. I don't know, depends how bad your aim is. Is your aim really bad? No. I like that one more. Go down here like I did and you can hit it straight on them. Kneel there, crouch there. Bruce. Do you want me to start it and you can finish it off? Yeah. I like that one. Watch how I do it. Yeah I'm doing much different. I'm pushing it up a little bit so you can finish it off. See if you can get it in straight the rest of the way. Get down a bit so you can, your arms below. Yay! Go on try again. See how I was getting lower and knocking it upwards. Yeah but I'm small. That is easier for you. So why can I stand up? So you're still hitting downwards, you need to hit upwards. So that'll do. Just knock it in so it doesn't fall out. It'll do the job. So they really did do a great job didn't they? And that's another thing ticked off that hope has dismantled that we've had to fix. Do you know what? If she didn't break so many things then I reckon a lot more would get done around here. But well that's the joy of having a heavy cob. Another thing that Simon and Bruce did was filled in the big holes at the side of the stable. Well they've been there since we first got here and well they needed filling in. So they got on with that too. And this is how they did it. It's Laplarch isn't it? Yeah. Can't remember now. Can't remember what it's called? It's a shiplap. Shiplap. Shiplap. Thick on that side. Thin on that side. You can see that. And it is to replace this section here that is missing. And this little square that's just behind Dream. It's actually something that hope didn't break. They were just never there in the first place. And well if you've been watching our vlogs for a while then you'll know that Bruce has done a few little like and subscribe things through them. Haven't you Bruce? Don't forget to like and subscribe to stay tuned for other videos. What I'm going to pull these nails out with you. The hammer or the black silver part. I know. Which one? Okay. I love this thing. This is my favourite toy you've got. What's that your favourite tool? And I forgot how to use it. I don't know whether it is. We are going to be able to use it. What? Oh. Oh. Where did it go Bruce? Somewhere around. That's your job. You have to get the magnet. You have to drag it through the dirt. Oh god. Is he strong? He's strong. There it is. There it is. Oh. Oh. Oh. Where did it go Bruce? Somewhere around. That's your job. You have to get the magnet. You have to drag it through the dirt. Oh god. Oh god. He's strong. There it is. They're all 17 inches. How many do we need? One. I think it's like that one. No. Three. There it is. What is? Who cackles, consciousness,uchi bright,Ð¾Ð·chish? There it is. desperation covers. I'm going to hang out every day. Oh god. How many times do we need? One, two, Cos rapid frame. 70 seconds or something apart today. Thermalï¿½! There it is. I think it looks like that one. Hold a bit too short, kind of it. Much is the one underneath, isn't it? A little bit skewy. I think the bottom, look, the bottom, because it was straight originally, is butted up and then the top isn't because the whole thing's on one piece. I'm just going to try and do it as straight as possible. Hi! Hi! Hi! What is that? Let's get my name. Hi, puppy. Look! Oh no! That's all we've got. Can't put a tiny piece on. You keep your window open because the wood wasn't quite long enough. Well, what a difference that makes. Little things, you know, for the cost of, I think it was Â£4 for that one board and it's done all that and made that look so much neater. So, that's amazing. Right, I'm going to have a go at getting these mats up now, see if that's possible. And until next time, bye bye! Bye bye! Bye bye!
