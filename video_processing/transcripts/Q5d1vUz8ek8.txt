 How's it guys welcome back to another episode of Morgz Brew you here in my farm lab we're gonna do this with a lot less emphasis on the edit and a lot more emphasis on the information and today's information is going to be about irrigation not just any irrigation I'm setting up a drip line system but I'm not gonna be installing it today I do have a little bit of something I am gonna do in the lab today I'm gonna replace one of the tines of my broad fork that I recently fabricated turns out I cut it too thin but first off if you haven't already seen any of my content welcome to my channel I am Morgz Brew I'm gonna be dedicating the next few episodes on this channel to our garden that we're busy developing and that is where the strip line irrigation is going to be going I may put the link up there if it's not there yet means we haven't installed it if it's there it means we have installed it however if it isn't there it may just mean that I forgot to come back from the future into the past to put my tag up on the top of it and as I talked to you guys I was checking out all these little wasps these guys are terrible things out there I've got this little allergy to them I sweat a prop so I always worry about you know them flying around my neck over here but we run into them at least once a week in the in the banana fields in the summer anyways that starts digressing from where I'm going I'm trying to tell you guys about this irrigation system that I'm setting up and I got it down here these are the pipes put it over here put that up there why are we setting up an irrigation system well the primary reason I suppose for me is time and efficiency efficiency both in time management and in water efficiency water use efficiency farm work is considered one of the lowest paid jobs so let's just work at minimum minimum human cost per hour is 20 Rand and if you're gonna water for an hour twice a day you're gonna be using two hours of your time strictly on watering those two hours equals 40 Rand a day now this is probably like three bucks or something in the states I don't know for you guys that's crazy cheap but let's just roll with this calculation for a second here you 40 Rand a day 10 days 400 Rand 30 days you're looking at a thousand two hundred Rand every three months is three thousand six hundred Rand now this whole setup by the filter cost me less than three thousand six hundred Rand so what I'm trying to say is that that time saved on watering pays itself off in three months if you come and look at my garden from the top and I will zoom out of here to the next section where you can check it from the top we've got a drone image of our garden and I've got this into four blocks and you can see here quickly four blocks block block block a storage water both 5,000 liters of water they're plumbed up in series over here so they're both going to come into it we're going to put our filter I just filter in line over here which is going to run down here into our garden and then it runs along here this 40 mil comes down into the middle our hostel our lemongrass and our moringas and then basically splits the garden down here and we've got two taps on this system but back to the filter so this filter this is a basic disk filter water flows in one way comes up around here and has to go through this disk system before it comes out the other side of the filter over here and what I want to show you is on this filter I don't know if we're going to get great focus but you can see this ribbing so teeth on these things when we tighten this up and it be closes up all together what you end up with is a 130 micron filtration through this disk so that's going to hopefully stop any of our emitters from clogging up and the water comes down here we're going to get to our first 40 mil 32 reducing T we're going to come out of here and that reducing T into our 32 mil our 32 mil is then going to run our sub main up and down so that way and this way along these beds on that sub main we're going to manage it through these ball valves so the setup of six beds across this is going to be managed through the single ball valve so they said it would be easy you just drill a little eight mil hole and you stick this little pipa key through one of those holes in there and then you tighten up this nut over here tighten up the nut so that it comes up against ends up against the plastic closing it off problem with the system that I'm finding is that you can't just push this little pipa key through one of these through one of these holes over here because ah so I've never owned one of these things but I saw a sweet deal in one the other day and I couldn't resist so that's it looks like it's it it's in anyways it looks like I needed a 10 mil bit on the end of my drill so that's basically it I'm going to put two drip lines into each bed running the length of the beds which are 10 meters but now this drip line I haven't opened yet so hang on a second here let's pull this guy up yep good see we can brighten up there we go so that's what our drip lines are like and you can see underneath there there's sort of like a square underneath that hole hey tackman oh block some one light so there's a bit of a square underneath that hole and inside that you can see that little molded inline emitter and there's actually a molded inline little filter inside there to help minimize any other blockages we might get thanks Agriplus you guys are legends for supplying this so that's the basic setup each blocks can be controlled by single valve six beds per block and that's what we're gonna do there but I've got to fix my broad fork get the beast out okay before we get onto this weld I just want to give you guys a any of you novice welders out there like me a little tip a secret to welding to beating the welding demons and the most important thing is camouflaging yourself so you can see I'm wearing green to camouflage the metal and blue to blend in with the UV arc so make sure that your shirt is the same color as metal you're working on and you're wearing a blue jacket just for that extra little bit of sand very well time you're working on and you're wearing a blue jacket oh you'll be giving you a blue jacket it feels like it's cool toроп�ain in the fastest way the extraoff nós we've have the same color aswe조Flow stop, whenever you've done this and remember from the shaft uh you know adjust where these hooks are andQué but you're speaking of the caliber of the Đây Horn of Zoom Director. Oh my god! What are you doing now as we always get everybody gonna have somebody? There's a very glad Кстати The Adventure of the Diamond Picture but we can be attitude So there's the basic tack. We've just got it on both sides of here so that it doesn't warp. What I'm going to do now is go ahead and tack the other side a couple of times and then run a deep weld on to this to close it up. And then use a Waltz Oh deploy to the first த with things installed. as the other talents used to accept this one by making alone. assessmentsąd? Oh yes. Just Щ? Thengulo for years tubing And then, glue it in, grab��ので� that stems to covertity and put pressure nasa the fresh root will be loaded in, Anyways guys, that's about it for me in this right now. So let's go outside, have a look and see at where we're going to put this drip irrigation. And that's going to be it. That's going to wrap up for us. And I'll finish off in the garden here with a little shot in the distance. So come along, let's go. Man cave, man cave. Welcome to the garden. Let's go check this out. And basically this is where we're going to be flipping out soon. We're going to be changing out these onions, turning these onions, drying them, recomposting these systems. This row cover here is over some lettuce which is nearly done. This side over here we've got our peppers which are producing, our cabbages which are coming along. Nearly done. We're going to pull these out and make some sauerkraut. Our spinach, we've just taken a massive yield off of these. And on this side here we're going to put in, we've got sunflowers, corns and beans coming in. Our onions are just about done this side too so they'll be coming out soon. And over here we've got some more spinach and more cabbage planted up over here. Yeah, so this is the garden. These are our four plots. And you're going to see us up here now...now. we have got some cutting-ups. We have got some help from them. Let's get some sugar control oben in here. Now let's get a wastage so I get before just because of that. I'm going to get a nosotros on and get some more layers right now. Now and Sonando. Well, it is a knitting line. I pick one more day and a quarter of this in the morning, if I come to a sprint. It's different, and does not get something higher. Right? Yes, it will be easier on and there's strength. Alright guys, and that's it. That's gonna be a wrap for us for today. This is how we have been watering, we use two of these 10-litre watering cans for each of our 10-meter beds. It's just been a tedious job, you know, coming out here twice a day, putting all that water out. So we finally made the investment and we've gone ahead and bought this drip line. We're going to install it in the coming weeks. And like I said, we're going to start flipping out these beds around me here. We'll show you, we'll bring you along for the installation process, the harvest of this garden. And that's going to start up the season. It's going to be our next season, our summer season and our next season here on YouTube. So I'm quite excited for this new season, for this new chapter in the garden with drip line irrigation. And yeah, that's about it for today, guys. And thanks. See you guys next week, Friday for another brew. I'm에서 Be did94 ut empezar 플러시를 pit milen voice bit bit Thank you.
