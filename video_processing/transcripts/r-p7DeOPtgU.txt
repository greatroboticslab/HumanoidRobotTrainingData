 basic requirement to start your own pig farm that will be the subject of today's video all right guys it's a beautiful moment right here if you're new to this channel please ensure you subscribe to this channel lots of great content on profitable big family will be made available to you all right let's go off quickly what are the basic requirement for you to start your own pig farm now number one you need to have a space to keep them that's basic uh you you wouldn't keep your animals of course people run the extensive system but i would advise you make use of the intensive because it's far more better than it the the extensive system because these are uh fatty animals so you don't want your animals running all over the place they would obviously lose a lot of energy and fat in the process so you want to ensure you keep them in an intensive system so one of the basic requirements is for you to have a space to keep them and for you to build that space one of the uh important thing you need to have is a fit trough of course some people drop their feeds on the ground like well i would not advise you run that or i think it'd be good for you to have like a trough a feeding trough it could be as big as this it could be smaller than this anyhow you decide to do it uh works well as long as you can easily put your feeds in there conveniently and they can feed as they want so that's one of the basic grammar make sure you have a feeding trough for them and then also ensure you make the the flooring very solid because these guys are very destructive animals if you have not if you have not heard that before please quickly notice these guys can dig almost anything once they get a a an avenue into the the hole they keeps they keep on digging so you want to make sure you spend on quality uh materials for the flooring that's one of the basic requirements you need make sure the flooring is very solid don't use too cheap material don't economize on that make a very solid flooring so that's one of the other basic requirement you need to ensure that uh your animals are uh going to be all right and ensure that your farm will be good to go now you also need uh a way to give them water and there are different ways to go about that of course we in this pen right here we're making use of this innovative way but uh that's an alternative also the trough you see there one is actually meant for food the other is meant for water now this is like a deprecated system not too many people are using the system anymore where uh you are in short that serves not just as the water trough but also as the wallow i'm talking about this uh on trough right here it's also south as the wallow but not many people are uh imbibing this system anymore the the modern way now is to make use of the shower system the o system where you make use of osse uh like this make use of osse like this to uh to spray the animals you could get a better one or to spray the animals and after spraying the animals yeah because one of the main reason why you have the wallow system is because these guys are special animals that means they that means they don't have sweat pores so they are special in the way in that sense their body doesn't have sweat pores so whenever it's quite hot like a situation like this if you look right here you can see what this guy is doing you can see how this guy is sleeping inside the water that's because it's trying to find a way to cool off the body so because of that unique unique characteristics of pigs you have to make uh an avenue for them to be able to cool their body and uh if you're not going to do the wallow system as i told you already is deprecated you can also uh make use of the hose that means at a certain interval during the day you will just uh take the hose and spray the animals that's being used whichever one works for yourself some other people make use of the automated shower system or even the manual shower system where right on the top they fix uh the shower right on the top of their pen they fix the shower there and they can switch there will be a switch where you can switch on the shower the shower falls and uh when the shower is done at a is done at a point some people do some automated one where it comes at a certain moment in the day maybe in the afternoon maybe by 12 o'clock the shower will on for probably all depends that of course it's a modern world right now so lots of great innovations are out there now but uh some people do the manual one where you just switch the shower on and it pours uh out for them that's of course all those things i talked about are quite expensive so depending on your budget you can decide on which one to use use so some people actually just make use of um the water paint that means they use like a paint to just like a water container to just wet them with bowls so that's another way people do it so people use different means so but you know some of these means are much more uh uh tedious than the other ones so whichever one works for you make sure you uh imbibe that so one of the other basic requirements that i would advise you to have on your farm is a water tank and there's a very big need for you to have this because these animals are animals that have uh good they they use water a lot uh pigs are animals that water is a basic requirement for them so you want to ensure you have a water tank depending on whatever capacity depending on the farm you have you go for the capacity that you need it may be one thousand or a one five or two thousand or probably bigger than that so you can get a water tank where you can easily pump your water into so also that also suggests that you are supposed to have a pumping machine where you pump your water into it for those of us that don't have uh that are in places where the power supply is not connected there we have to make use of the generator the automate or the alternative means generator to obviously channel water into the tank of course this is a new age where there is solar available so you can get some solar devices that would also help in pumping depending on your budget also but there's a very big need for a water tank it'll be very tedious for you to make use of a well of course your world is very close by maybe but your world is quite far it'll be very tedious because these animals we need lots of water and i would really advise you don't reduce the number of water you give them because of the stress that it takes so what make sure you find a convenient means that would ensure that they will get water continually also obviously they will be needing a roof on their head so please don't make that mistake of leaving your house to the open sky where water can easily fall in even though we say these guys needs water we are not it doesn't mean they need water in that sense where the rain is always on them they need a place where whenever rain is falling they can be honda they don't need water all the time they need water at some certain time so please you need to be informed that you need a roof and for us right here this roof was uh this is not the new one you know this is this uh iron sheet you see here is uh the used one of course when you are running a farm you want to make use of the cheapest way to go about things as i already revealed in a video already so you want to make use of the cheapest way you can see uh the way we did this using the bamboos and everything so make sure you uh do what works for you and do what works for your budget but this is one of the basic grammar you need a roof on the head of your piece also you'll be making use of buckets obviously to mix your feeds uh the broom the paka and all those many things these are some of the things you need to have the shovel you need the shovel the what you use to mix your feed all those things are basic requirements you should have while starting your farm and you want to also make sure you have uh all the disinfectants that you will make use of to ensure the right bowel security on your farm so these are basic requirements you know basic meaning the most the things that you cannot afford but you must have on your farm so please uh if you're planning to start your home pick farm these are some of the things you should look out for to start your
