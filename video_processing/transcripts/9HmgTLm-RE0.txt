 Pinkfong! Neenie Moe! Pinkfong! Neenie Moe! Pinkfong! Story time with Pinkfong and animal friends! The Farm Choir Ahem! Farm Choir? Everyone gather around! I have great news to announce! There is an animal singing contest next month! We need to start practicing to win first place this year! Now it's time to choose the lead singer! Who wants to give it a try? Me! When it comes to singing, no one can beat me! Silly duck on the farm! Quack, quack, quack, quack! Quack, quack! Wow! That's a baby! That's the best! Oh, hey! Huh? I want to try out too! Ahem! Tinky donkey on the farm! Hee-ha! Hee-ha! Let's sing together! Ha-ha! Hee-ha! Hmm, sounds a little out of tune, but very unique! As long as you practice more, you will definitely be able to sing better! Thank you! I declare that the lead singer of our farm choir is... Duck! Yes! And don't get it! Whoa! He was out of tune! How can he be the lead singer? Although I am not as good as Duck, I will try my best to sound good! You can do it! Hmm! Hey, everyone! Rehearsal starts tomorrow morning! Remember to get here on time! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Ah! Wait! Don't eat! Hmm! Huh? Huh? Huh? Wake up! You will be late to the rehearsal! Oh! A talented singer like myself doesn't need to practice! Well then, I am still going to practice hard! La la la la! Hee-ha! Ha! Huh? Huh? Huh? I am so nervous! It's okay! That's alright! Let's do it again! Ugh! Hmm! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Fa! Ha! Ha! Ha! I! All kinds of wise! Let's sing! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Here! And ha! Ha! Ha! There! Here! Ha! Here! Here! Here! Everywhere! a He-ha! We are farm animals! Let's sing together! Duck is still not here today. Today is our last rehearsal. I told her she must attend. Huh? Huh? So sleepy. Finally, everyone is here. So, let's start the final rehearsal. Uh-oh. I think I had a weird crack in my voice. No worries. Let's keep singing. No! No! I can't find the pitch. I should have practiced the song. Everyone here except me knows their part and is ready to perform. I don't think I can be the lead singer anymore. Don't worry. I can help you practice. We can help you practice too, Duck. Thank you. Thank you, friends. All right, everyone. Let's start rehearsing now. Let's sing together. Let's sing together. Let's sing together. Let's sing together. Let's sing together. Let's sing together.
