 guys welcome to comparing quick hitches 2020 edition well we've got six quick hitches lined up here and if you just give them a quick glance you might see a few different colors but the construction is generally the same let's go ahead and point out some differences here throughout this video show you oh let's just wait for Rosie there really quick don't mind us show you what actually makes these things a little bit different one of them is going to stand out from the rest in a big way it's going to save you a lot of money make sure you stick around oh yeah really quick if you haven't done so yet hit that subscribe button right underneath the video make sure you read to the description as well a lot of helpful links down there check out the other videos on the channel here we go okay so I'm going to go ahead I'll tell you what each one of these quick hitches is here you know who makes it the manufacturer that kind of thing then we're going to kind of go through just some general properties of them you know weight dimensions construction color adjustability and if they require bushings or not as far as pricing goes you can get that on my website go to goodworkstractors.com it changes over time I don't really like to put the pricing in here I call this the 2020 version because I did a version about two and a half years ago I put the price of one of these quick hitches in there and the price went up it's gone up a couple times since then and so you know it's like putting my foot in my mouth when I can't honor that price because the prices just go up over time okay so this one right by me here is going to be the work saver quick hitch this is the one that I've been selling over the last couple of years very popular choice very well built a good price point as well this green one that you see here this can be the john deer eye match you're going to see all sorts of those all over the place this next one up right here is going to be a tar river quick hitch okay and keep in mind these are all category one quick hitches as well next one up here is going to be a land pride this particular model is a qh15 on there next one up right here is a nortec you guys probably haven't seen this on my website but I did just get these in fairly recently and the last one right here is going to be the brand new one that I have the spiko quick hitch okay so first thing here let's just take a look at the general construction probably one of the key differences between a couple different versions of this is going to be in kind of this gusset area here this cross bracing area between the legs that come down and then the top section okay so if you take a look a lot of them are going to have this thicker chunkier beefier section here you can see it there in the spiko you can see it there on the nortec you can see it oh nope not on the land pride you can see it there on the tar river you got a little bit right there on the eye match and then you're going to have it you know that same chunkiness on the work saver as well now over here on the land pride if you look in the back side there is a they do have a flat piece right here okay a flat piece of steel get you down take a look on the bottom side it's kind of hard to see you know but maybe you can see it there a little bit better but this all the others that are going to have that substantial cross bracing it's all the way through okay on the front and the back so that's going to be one of the key differences between these quick hitches now on a general construction note as well you can see on the top hook where there's all the different positions there okay that's going to be pretty well standard some might have an extra bolt hole or two compared to some others we're talking these bolt holes here where you can adjust the top hook and in multiple positions there was an old version of at least the eye match probably some others as well that actually had just a welded top hook so this wasn't able to be moved and adjusted up and down which is very convenient to do so keep that in mind if you are shopping for something that's in the used market and you see an eye match or something similar maybe just double check it has these additional holes here where you can adjust this top hook position so while we're kind of staring at these top hooks here too if you take a look you see how this comes out here and then it's kind of a longer taper if you take a look at the eye match for instance it's a pretty narrow position from here to here with not as much of a taper so you'll hear some folks say they have trouble with this top hook not kind of extending out enough to be able to grab the top link there on the three-point hitch you can see there these others all kind of for the most part generally extend out a little bit further okay compared to the eye match just a point of observation they're all going to have these spring handles that are on top here so if you take a look this way you can just you know rock that top handle you can see down here pay attention to down here okay when you open up the top handle it retracts that okay and then you close it back up on top of there just the general functionality of all these doesn't really matter you can see there's levers on on all of them too one for each side there okay next up we're going to do the old weight test on here got the scale out here hopefully you can see the the the digital display right there if you can i'll go ahead and repeat it but i did add a piece of wood on here it's reading 0.0 i zeroed it out with the wood i just need that on there to kind of support the legs uh we'll go ahead and get some weights okay so spiegel's reading in at 69.6 pounds this is the nortec 56.6 pounds land pride 68.6 pounds tar river 56.0 i match 65.4 well 65.2 it went down to lastly is the work saver it does come with this um this top link here which i'm going to take off this is just for like non quick hitch compatible attachments if you can see that right there kind of goes in and gives a little bit more flexibility to connect but also i just realized let's see the spiko doesn't have the top pin so that's probably just a few ounces there that's gonna you know affect the weight but not significantly the work saver 70.2 pounds okay okay i don't want to keep you hanging too much longer but i want to get right to the point here on why that spiko is going to save you a bunch of money okay it's going to save you a lot more money compared to all the others every single other one that you saw there is going to require something like what you see right here now this big old rusty looking thing you might see in brass color as well but it's called a bushing okay it takes what is a category one attachment and turns it into a category three attachment for whatever reason category one quick hitches nobody's ever explained it to me need to get upsized to a category three by use of this bushing which can be upwards of forty dollars per set you need to have a set of these bushings for every three-point attachment that you would normally hook up directly to your three-point hitch with a category one no problem you need to get a set of these bushings for every single one that you want to put in a quick hitch quick hitch are just a fantastic tool to take the pain out of the hookup process they're not going to hook up the pto but they're going to take the process of attaching individually the three points on the three-point hitch and allow you to do that all at one time so with that spiko quick hitch there you don't need those bushings so depending if you have two three four five six attachments times that by just roughly forty dollars for a ballpark and you can look at the savings that you're going to see and did i mention i can ship these quick hitches out to you as well so yeah i can ship the spiko i can ship the nortec if you want it i can ship the tar river i can ship a used i match i don't get news of those and i can ship a work saver so i can ship pretty much what you see here the lampred i kind of keep for demonstration purposes but i do get used i matches in the other stuff is going to be brand new typically the speak goes right now are the big seller because again they don't require those bushings so get a hold of me if you'd like to order one now let's grab a quick dimension here we're going to go ahead and take the outside to outside might come back and do the inside to inside as well but you're going to see these are all going to be very very very similar in in width overall okay not really too concerned about the height from the bottom link to the top link because you can see again with all the adjustability that these have you can play with this however you need to you have more than enough flexibility there to make that work so main concern is going to be your width down here in the bottom i just want to show it to you that way you can see it for yourself outside to outside on the speako just under 29 and a half outside to outside on the nortech just over 29 and a half outside to outside on the lampride just under 29 and a half outside to outside on the tar river just over 29 and a half outside outside on the i match pretty much right on 29 and a half and then outside to outside on the WorkSaver, just under 29.5. There's going to be manufacturing tolerances that come into play that's going to have that vary just slightly, but basically look at 29.5 outside to outside dimension. Okay, now really quick, we'll go ahead and do the inside to inside. You're going to be at 27.25 on the Spico, 27.25 on the Nortec, basically 27 on the Land Pride. Just over 27.25 on the Tar River, about 27.8 on the iMatch, and 27.8 on the WorkSaver. Well, I hope that was as much fun for you as it was for me. Got a little bit of a workout in there, but Spico, okay. I've been selling these things like hotcakes right now, but got a lot of questions on them recently, so I wanted to show you how they compared to the other models that are in here. Try to do that, give you as much of an apples to apples as possible. It's not perfect. It's not scientific. It's going to be doing my thing, okay? So I don't really care which one you buy, as long as you buy it from me. Maybe I'll cut that out. I might leave it in. But the point being, the reason I'm selling so many of these right now is because of this requirement right down here. It does not require the bushings. It's a direct fit to your Category 1 pins. Saves you a lot of money that way. Again, if there was some majorly detrimental reason to why it shouldn't be set up like this, I probably wouldn't be selling them, okay? But the fact that there's not, and nothing has ever been said about the reason why that these bushings are required for all these other quick catches here, I don't know, seems like a racket to me. So whatever. I mean, this is just information for you guys, helping make a better decision, because a lot of you guys can't come and see this product in person. I ship it out all the time. So it's just to let you see what they all are side by side. You know, dimensional-wise, they're all built to the same ASAE specification that is going to be controlling the dimensional tolerances of everything. That way it works. And so that means it not only is going to be on the quick hitch side, but also the quick hitch compatible attachments. If something is branded as quick hitch compatible, it's going to work with a quick hitch, okay? You may just need the bushings if you don't go ahead and get a Spico. As far as color, hey, right now they're red. I had some in black. You know, get a can of spray paint, paint it whatever color you want. It's just a basic hunk of steel meant to make your life a lot easier. Get into it cheaper without the bushings.
