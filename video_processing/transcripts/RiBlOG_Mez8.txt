Howto & Style
 Welcome back to Durango Electric Culture. In this episode we want you to keep planting. Wow look at these poppies. Terragon. Look at that. Okay you take the tarragon, rip it open, and then look at all those little tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny seeds. Just to spread them out all over the place. Open up another one and keep planting. When the seeds are so tiny it's good to use like the entire flat. That way you can get it. Oh yeah and once the seeds are down you want to be spraying it to keep them down and you know water them up be nice to them. It's a good thing to do. And then of course check on oh eighth inch deep. Yeah there we go. Next up dill. Look at that. All right. Use your seed pods. A few here. A few there. A few everywhere. All right and after that of course you want to soak them down. I want to get these good because the seed pods are have a tendency to dry out. And then you know the usual. Cover them up. Everything's growing so fast. Let's show you all about it. May 25th.
