Education
 All right, so let's get into this. A little bit about my background. I am a biologist by trade, nothing to do with plants. I worked at the DNA level at Indiana University. I recently retired last year. But everything I've learned in terms of fruit growing and stuff has been in the last eight years, typically through people who are doing the growing themselves. So why fix? This is not something that is common here in the Midwest. However, there is a demand for fresh jigs in the Midwest, especially down where I'm from. I lived in Bloomington, Indiana, Indiana University, and I was also a student at Purdue. A wide diversity of folks in those areas, many of them coming from California or warmer regions or countries where figs are common, and people eat them every day. If you want to get a fresh fig here in the Midwest, kind of good luck, right? Not easy. And if you do get them here, they've been shipped from California or someplace else. And by the time they get here, they've been on a truck for months or weeks or whatever. They're not going to be as great. So we know that there's a demand for fresh figs. If you can get them to grow, you could probably command a very good amount of money for what you grow. So it is a niche market. And so our goal in this project is to work out the conditions where more farmers can start growing fresh figs on a small scale or bigger scale and provide them to local markets if there will be an interest. Okay. So the beauty of figs, unlike other fruits, and I'm not going to get into the growth of a fig and whether or not it's really a fruit or not. But if you're growing apple, pear, peach, persimmon, pawpaw, whether it's native or non-native, you're going to take years before that tree can give you fruit. All right. So the beauty of figs is you can actually start to get figs on one-year-old trees. And if the stars align and the climate is great and everything is perfect, you can actually get a second crop, which is called a Breva. The main crop is in the summer, fall, mostly towards fall, but the secondary crop can be in the spring. The main crop grows on new growth from the season. The secondary Breva crop grows on last year's growth. And I won't talk about the Breva crop very much, but I can direct you to some reading if you're interested in that. Oops, wrong way. All right. So about this project, it's a partnership. And the goal of this partnership, it includes three farms, and we're looking at the production of cold hardy fig varieties. There's cold hardy and not cold hardy. So there's two kinds. We're looking at zones five and six, which covers Indiana and other areas in the north central region. And our goal is to kind of try and establish the best conditions for growing those figs and providing new opportunities to you guys as farmers. So those are the main goals. And let's talk about what cold hardy figs really mean. So a cold hardy fig typically, and if you've heard of figs, Chicago hardy is probably the one you've heard of the most. It grows beautifully. You can get figs if everything stars align, and you don't get an early frost. But then if you get temperatures below 20 degrees, that thing is going to die back to the ground, and then it just springs back down. It's like a perennial. It's back year after year. Ideally, we would like to not let it die back to the ground. We'd like to get conditions where the above ground part stays alive and gives you a jump start on the next year's growth the following year so that you get more figs and you get figs before the frost. So that's the goal. So when we talk about cold hardy figs, we're talking about figs that survive and act kind of like as a perennial. They'll die back to the ground. They'll come back. But we're also going to look at trying to not get them to die back to the ground. Does that make sense for everybody? All right. So the three farms involved in this project, I'll just call them Farm 1, Farm 2, Farm 3, like thing one, thing three, and Dr. Seuss. Farm 1 is my place down in Greene County. I'm in Salisbury. You've heard of the Tulip trestle. That's I'm just like three miles down the road from the Tulip trestle and railroad bus to my property. We're zone 6B now. We were 6A. We've transitioned to 6B because it's getting warmer. Farm 2, Mimi and Evan, you heard them speak this morning about the truffles there in Park County, which is right up here. And they are now zone 6A. You were 5B, correct? Yeah. And then zone 5B all the way up in St. Joseph's is at the very top. We're looking at big roof up there as well. All right. So the project overview, when we wrote this grant, we said we would do it on multiple farms. That's part of the partnership in the USDA SARE program. We said we would focus on three cold hardy varieties. The ones that we finally chose were Chicago hardy, which is kind of the one that everyone has heard of the most in is probably growing the most. The other one, Syrian dark. And the third one, Abu George. Those are all cold hardy varieties. And I will get a new why we chose them in a little bit. And then we're testing those both in ground and comparing that to big thrown in pots. So those three varieties, growing them in ground, and those three varieties grown in pots. So the ones in the ground, we're winterizing them so that they try to survive and don't die back to the ground. And then the same ones in pots, we're putting them into a protected outbuilding or garage and overwintering in that way. A lot of people do this. They grow fixing pots in this area, especially hobbyists, and they'll pull them into their garage. They do need to go dormant. But we're looking at it. We're comparing the two to see if we can get those field ones to grow and you don't have to worry about throwing pots in and out every year. The third component that we said we would look at, and I'm not going to talk much about this today because we haven't done a whole lot on this yet, is looking at living mulches that might complement the figs. So can we possibly get a second crop out of that same space? Or can we put something in it that's going to protect the soil or provide more nutrients to the soil? So depending on your interest, there's different ways to approach this. But we do want to keep the soil protected and maybe get another crop out of it, something that might be worthwhile in market. So the three, again, that we're focusing on are Chicago hardy, Syrian dark, Abu George. Each farm is growing minimally four, if not five, of each of those in ground and also in pots. These were recommended to us by Darren at Brambleberry Farm, if you're familiar with Darren. And Darren had a number of other cold hardy ones that he started to play around with and he thought might be fun for us. So we got several of those from him, and we're just kind of testing them here and there. They're not on all three farms across the board, unfortunately, but we are getting a little bit of data out of these as we've started growing them. Brooklyn dark, Brooklyn white, brown turkey. That's probably the other one that people have heard of the most. Gina's black, Latterula, LSU gold. It was created, I believe, in LSU University or Ellis University. Magbar hardy, which Darren believes is probably Chicago hardy, but there's a story behind it. Magnolia, Rhonda Bordeaux, Sunflower and Violette de Bordeaux. So let's start with the in ground things. What did we do? So we, Darren rooted sign for our own messenger. If you're not familiar with what that is, is when the figs go dormant, you collect twigs off of them, usually one year old growth. And then for figs, you can actually root those in sand or a combination of sand and furlite or sand and peat moss. They root very easily, and then you start a whole new tree that way. So Darren did this for us last winter. And we obtained those from him in April of this past year. We got them planted the first weekend in June, which is a little late, but because the project wasn't awarded until later in the spring, we had to go with what we could do. So we planted them the first weekend in June, and we planted them with a lot of compost. Each farm got a little bit different amounts of compost, and that was based solely on how we dug the holes. So my farm, Farm 1, we don't have a tractor. We don't have mechanical stuff. We dug our holes by hand. So we did not dig them very deep, and we didn't put a lot of compost in. Mimi's farm, Farm 2, and the farm, Farm 3, they mechanically dug their holes, so their holes were deeper. And so a lot more compost went into those holes. That's just kind of by default. Mulching, we, or covering the soil, the bare soil that was there, we did that various ways. My farm on Farm 1, we put down a ton of cardboard and wood chips so that we weren't getting a lot of weeds and that we were keeping the soil from being fried by the hot sun. Mimi, you guys did wood chips and straw or straw? The wood chips for the mulching. The straw was for the winter. Yeah, yeah. And then Farm 3, they used landscape fabric up there. Watering, typically weekly, but you know, we had a drought last year, and so in some cases we were watering a little more frequently. The original goal in the project was to grow all of these trees upright so that we could then cage them and protect them in the winter. However, between the time the grant was awarded, or actually around the time it was awarded, Mimi went to Japan and was able to see some installations where they're growing figs in an espalier or cordon style, which means you're training them. And in this case they're being trained to load to the ground in a horizontal way so that you can protect them a little bit more and they can benefit from the soil or the earth as a thermal mass in the wintertime. Like a step overhead. No, so we'll get into what this looks like in a second. Yeah. So farms one and two, my farm and Mimi's farm are using this different support system than what we originally said we would do. Farm 3 is sticking with the original upright support system that we'll go into. So this is what the cordon system looks like. So basically we have taken and hammered down in a pipe. It could be either aluminum or steel. Down two feet into the ground, leaving one foot above the ground. And then running a horizontal aluminum pipe down the road. And then planting two figs. A water bottle and a black bone. These are two figs. Planting them within a foot of each other, letting them grow up, and then letting them train this way along the pool. So you're getting figs coming up, training them to go horizontally away from each other. And loosely tying them down, not touching the aluminum pipe, but just tying them down so they start to train. Once they're trained, you don't need that pipe really technically anymore, but it'll probably stay there for as long as you can. And then you plant two that way, and then eight years later you plant another two. So eventually two coming up are going to meet each other at some point, but we'll keep them pruned and trained so that they're not interfering with each other. We're also, if you'll notice, so you see cattle panel off to the right. We put cattle panel both on either side of the figs eventually to protect them from deer. This also serves to help us when we do the winterization. This was probably the most expensive part of the project, but it's a one and done. Once you do it, you don't have to do it again. The panels come down very easily. So if you want to get in and weed or pick figs, they're eight foot cattle panel, and you just tie them down. You know, tie them to the, to the T-posts. You could just easily take those down and get in there and work with the figs. Any questions about this? The flag was. So just give a little plug here. So this is an example on the right of what a cordon fig looks like. So this is one that Dr. Lee Reich has posted in his book, Growing Figs in Cold Climates. It's a very easy read if you're interested. But he has grown one of his figs low to the ground. You can't see it in this picture. He did not use an aluminum pipe to train it along. He actually just bent it over and secured it down to the ground. There's cheap and easy ways you can do this. And this one's probably been there for quite a while. But then you can see new seasons growth shooting upwards about every couple inches. And the idea is that figs start to grow on that new growth every year. And so you get multiple places and it's easy to go in and just quickly pick those figs as they grow. Okay. These are all, is there dwarf or semi dwarf or what's the fig? There are dead figs. In a fig world, I don't think there's any dwarf or semi dwarf figs. So they're all the same? Yeah. And you just, you've grown and trained as you need. They won't, if you just let them go, they're going to get maybe 15 feet tall. Oh really? And they'll look like a big bush. Okay. I think they'll do the same thing on the corner on the north. They could, they're going to go 15 feet. They could. You could keep training them for a fairly long period of time, but we will. Yeah. Yeah. Get the birth of that main trunk. But, you know. Structure. They're tall. Yes. You know. So if they are in a high tunnel, you just spend those new growths, the stems from the searing. I mean, yes, yes. Yes. In terms of dwarf, Scott, the third barn, he does bonsai. Oh yeah. The other thing. He's done a big bonsai. Uh oh. Yeah. Thank you. The indoor dwarf. So, and that's true for a fruit tree. You can, you can train a regularly sized fruit tree to be more. It's still out of pruning. So if you stay on top of the pruning, you can, you can manage a tree and keep it, keep it small. Okay. I see, you know, I see people growing apple trees in a pot for 20 years. And they stay small. So, yeah. And you, you sourced your, um, actual starts, I guess, from Bramblery. Bramblery. Yeah. Bramblery. Yeah. Bramblery farm in Paola, Indiana. Um, if you Google them, you'll find them. Uh, Darren and Spree own that. They will not ship. You have to go visit and for the visits. Not been to their place. Um, it's a lovely place to visit because they grow all sorts of cool things down there. Those all came from the house. Um, and I, I'm happy to share that information. Uh, I'll give you my new demo. All right, let's turn to the potted fix. So again, we want to compare in ground versus potted. Um, so we did pretty much the same thing. What the same size plants one year old or slightly less than had been rooted by, by Darren at Bramblery. Um, so we, he got, we got them in small pots, about a four to a liter in size. Um, we kind of kept them in those small pots to get them all established. Um, probably kept them a little too long, but we hit that drought in the summer. And so it just, it was kind of a half dozen on the other. We ended up up potting them to 10 gallon pots in early August. Um, we, I did not mulch. I don't think you mulched them. Did you put any wood chips or anything on top? Not initially. Not initially. Yeah. Um, but we will definitely be doing it this year. You could do wood chips. You could do leaf mulch. Um, anything to kind of keep a lot of evaporation from happening. Um, that way you can keep your watering down a little bit. And then we water weekly or as needed, just like with the in grounds. No support system at the moment. Um, if we want them to grow really tall, we could add, um, some sort of, uh, uh, like a bamboo post or something in there to kind of help stabilize those. But again, you can, you can prune and manage them and keep them small and it depends on your goal. Do they require a lot of water? You know, um, I was watering mine. So mine was on the west side of an outbuilding. So it wasn't on the south side. It was on the west side. And so it did get some morning shade. I think I was watering maybe a gallon once or twice a week. Um, which of those. So. Yeah, definitely. So mine was on the west. Mine was on the west side of an outbuilding. So it was not getting morning sun. Um, they were finally getting sun about, um, 11 o'clock or due. Um, they did really, really well. One of them. Yours was wholesome, correct? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I, looking at yours, this is my first supper a little more. Yeah. Um, and that is one thing with, with the pause. I mean, they're great in theory because they're mobile and you can move them around. But if you go on vacation or if you ignore them or you forget about them, you know, they could suffer. And so that's one of the reasons why I think it's really important that they get covered with something like wood mulch. Yeah. And I had an outdoor working cats, um, and they love it as a litter box. Um, so yeah. So this year I will definitely be covering mine so that the cats won't get into it. And then we won't be this moisture loss and those pods, which is plastic pots, or? it and there won't be this moisture loss and those pots were just plastic pots or they're yeah they're heavy industrial molded plastic pots i think they were remember what we paid i would say for 20 pots it was like 10 pots sometimes and drink and drink yes yeah you put them no they can't or they can't just want to make sure they have three yes but they're not they're just about the right size so if you i let mine almost dry out or get you know blow moisture so i can pick them up and move them but you know that's a lot on your back so you could easily take a dolly and slide it all in and fold them from place to place as long as you've got something to roll that all on so that's that there's a um a plant shop nursery about far from where we live they also do landscaping and in the back of it they have what they call a graveyard and that's where they put all the pots that they from their landscaping and anybody can go in again and go charge oh nice so that would be something you're looking for there yeah yeah all right so let's talk about mulching um so one of the goals in the project that we said we would do was try to explore some living mulches um or perhaps a secondary crop that helped keep that bare soil from uh drying out and and losing nutrients um we have not really explored that too much and if you talk what i said earlier all of us kind of did something a little bit different so uh my farm the in-ground uh figs got cardboard couple layers of cardboard followed by um mulch that i just found the local nursery so it's a it was engaged um uh wood mulch uh maybe used mulch originally um we'll talk about what we did for winter mulching and protection that's a little different wood chip mulch but i we also planted the media strawberry oh yeah one end okay just to see what happened and it's there it grows and it it's it pretty much withstands like foot traffic um so i i will just test right so yeah as a as a ground cover ground just for to deter weeds this target yep and i make it consider on my property putting in mint or another herb that's more aromatic that will grab the pins away um and i do a lot of herbal options later but um so another possibility is an herb that might be a value to help to protect um and also keep some parts away um winterization let's talk about winterization so um we have to protect them in winter and again one of our goals to see if we can keep those sticks from dying back to the ground darren all of his figs down at paoli he never does any winterization and he says all of them die back to the ground so that's kind of our starting point there um i do know people who have winterized their old their chicago hardies have had some success in keeping them from dying back um what we're doing on farm one and two again we're using that cordon system so we're growing those figs low to the ground that's taking advantage of the thermal mass of the earth which means they're going to stay a little bit warmer for a little bit longer down close to the ground and then we're covering them with a ton of straw you'll see a picture of this in the moment um for 16 figs that i had in a row it took 10 to 12 bales of straw to give you an idea to cover those farm three they took a different approach they used burlap um i'm wrong here in saying wire cages they didn't use wire cages else not what they used and they used some leaf mulch to protect and we'll show you pictures of what they did and then the pots they got moved into an indoor space you can let these figs stay out they can they could handle a frost they can handle multiple frost frost they just can't handle extended periods below 20 degrees so all of us left our our potted figs outside until late november early december and that's when we do the bed you really want them out there because you want them to go dormant the figs need to go through a dormancy period so you want them to kind of be um exposed to those cold temperatures so they lose their leaves and they go into that dormant phase and then go to that side or protect them so in ground this is what the in ground ones look like on farm one and two you can see we've got multiple rows here and the cattle panels are down for the moment so they could get in there and cover those figs with straw and again you want to just cover them as much as possible um i learned um that straw settles with time especially when you get snow so you want to put way more straw than you think it is it's going to settle through time um it didn't take as long as i thought it would and i also had my nieces and nephews help me and it's a fun family project um so it didn't really take long to do it we just got them covered um and then they just stay there all winter long taking a little nap farm three um they approached theirs a little bit differently so they've got the landscape fabric they did if you see the top left photo they first kind of wrapped the figs first a little bit um with some burlap and then they um used tar paper which is the roofing stuff it's it's um used for roofs and it's impermeable terrain they used they used a couple t posts and they just kind of wrapped it around the t post put tons of leaves down in there and then wrapped again with burlap you'll see that um carry there on at the bottom left she's wrapping with burlap over the tar paper and then the final step is put a bucket on top but you're not getting tonnerated there are those pruned down before they wrapped them um did you say pruned pruned yes cut down yeah i don't think so um we'll talk about how much growth they had eventually in if they in future years they might have to yeah this is its first year this is first year right yeah they they will get into this but um here their farm i think um i'll show you the tallest one how tall it got but it didn't get above those two posts so all right so what did we observe these first five months i really did not expect i mean we were just hoping that everything would survive year one get everything to survive but we did i did do some observations on growth um we did kind of check here and there for disease and pest pressure and then of course we didn't really expect to get figs but we were kind of surprised so we'll talk about that all right so growth in year one so those figs started out about this tall okay um this is nimi uh she's on farm two zone 6a this was the tallest fig uh in in the group um this was the lsu gold value um and so there was a ton of growth on that particular tree most of the trees depending on where they were in the plots grew anywhere from two feet to four feet um in one year's time uh the picture on the right is farm three and i believe that was the tallest fig that they had um on on their plot of 16. that looked even quite one year right because this is in like early uh late summer yes yeah so this is the winning brown on june the first week of june yep and this is it yeah so they grow fast at the plus um and so uh this this year i'll go through and do a very um careful analysis of how much growth on each variety so i was seeing some uh some differences um but i'll kind of mention those here in a second um i in zone in zone 6b farm one i had the least amount of growth as everybody which is kind of in a way surprising but maybe not because a i didn't use as much compost as the other two farms and b mine was in a really blazing hot field and so i'm thinking that i may consider in the future using maybe a 30 percent shade cloth during the really hot months just to give them a little bit of a break we'll see no is that just that picture that meaning it was that in the system where you were trying to control us like i can tell you that's before it was before we before you went yeah this is kind of late summer and it wasn't until fall like before the winter that we really started training oh yeah yes so we wanted to get them a good growth before training this is the tree not not shoot off right yeah so ideally we need to start training well this is like you know the first few months so i started training after we started training in the fall yeah yeah somewhere in there and then we started i think we started training time it was cold when i started tying them down yeah it's really cold so they're really flexible yeah they're pretty flexible so you know i think you tie them down to where you think you know it feels pretty good and i use cotton by the way all cotton just spray and then and then like you come back a week later or two and you tie it down even tighter because you know you've already trained in stuff to give just the compost and what do they require they're pretty i think they're pretty forgiving um we have gotten their soil test that's something that i should have done last year i'll do the springs um and i'll actually give you a little bit of insight so um on me so mimi has the most space um there's kind of a story behind that that i won't go into um farm one and farm three we have 16 figs in ground mimi's got a heck of a lot more like 48 or something like that yeah okay yeah she's got a lot uh so she's got the both of the oddball ones that we have um but on the space that we planted those in i noticed pretty quickly and i'll show this to you in a easier thing um figs at one part of the property are growing really well at the other end of the big growth is really short and we do know there was a house or a building on that place yeah so yeah this was the hill we will take you now yes um and it had old house that yeah i've never seen the house because it was already destroyed all it had was like concrete patio or whatever so we're going to do the walacini that's what happened right and the price so all this is planted on top of that hill without any uh amendments to the soil other than the compost that's where we dug the home i mean that was just and so to see this growth right where i'm thinking that the area that you had the least amount of growth is probably where the main part of the house might have been since both ends so it's really hard for me to say that okay you would think the house was more central for some reason that's yeah i don't know and i say that because i have a black wall out planning we planned we had an old house sitting down and we could we knew where the house was because we were the ones who took it down we put black walnuts and you kind of tell exactly where that house was because those trees are five feet and the ones in the perimeter where the house wasn't they're now 20 feet so you can tell there's a huge difference in what the soil was i mean i'll sat there for over a hundred years so um interesting so oh now that you mentioned so we cleared that entire hillside or the hill thinking we're gonna put in the wall of paint right all right so they basically graced all of the trees and weeds whatever was in there and there was a huge walnut a huge walnut on the north side and actually it was Matthew he said to me he goes a lot of walnuts around here yeah it's possible there yeah so it may be walnut resistant they could be yeah yeah maybe maybe there's no way of measuring but it's just a little bit of water right which i've learned off in the soil so well i'm throwing an active yeah that i don't know well we still have walnuts around yeah so we've got rid of that um so disease and pest pressure so um i mean pretty much this first year so it's really hard to say um i think the biggest thing that we've had was the drought you know keeping things from frying and that just required a little extra water here and there um i never saw any um i mean we got them in late so i think we kind of missed the japanese beetle phase um did that how did that coincide for you yeah no no it overlapped yeah because we got them in yeah directly at the same time as the japanese feed japanese beetles in our other field this the pigs they they didn't seem to like them or something and thank goodness they didn't go up to fig hill so i mean they're kind of close by yeah i don't know we'll just have to see i mean that's interesting so then the next question is big production so in theory oh go ahead um so i'm assuming that the pigs currently are still covered up yes so you really couldn't report on like uh bull or road yeah i'm talking about that right now okay very good question um so before we get to that let's talk about fig production so in theory first year figs should give um um should get fixed however considering that we didn't get these until the first beginning of june i find out i don't think either one is really expected to get things right things at all we did we got things so um all three of the main ones chicago hardy syrian dark abu george i observed things on all of those at bimmy's place um on my place i had a couple of things on syrian dark um and i think farm three got a couple of things as well i don't know which one they got it was like me they didn't get that many so we didn't really document that too well mimi's place she also had figs on brooklyn dark brooklyn white brown turkey gino's black lotterillo lsu gold and the magma hardy the uh magnolia is not in her place it's a mine place in a pot no figs um ronde bordeaux sunflower and violet they were all at one end and that's one of the areas i think it's the soil um so they grew didn't grow nearly as much and they also didn't produce very many fix so there could be something with the soil there that we need to um check on a little bit closer um the potted figs i don't think any of the potted figs or potted fig trees produced things so that's something worth noting as well and were they planted in pots did you just use um compost or what kind of soil we used to be kind of across the board something that we all had access to we just went to the nards and we bought um the miracle grow organic and another one of some antithesis adding soil yeah raised bed raised bed soils okay so i have a question for you on the varieties there's a there's a variety i really want to grow but it's been i've avoided it because it's zone eight nine do you know the zones on these and are any of them like specifically a higher zone that you actually got fruit of um so all of these are considered quote unquote whole parties so they they've been tested they've you know hobby growers have been growing them in these polar climates okay they might not be zoned eight nine that you're supposed to i just want that tiger panache one yeah that's really cool looking but i it just seemed like a waste of money if i knew it was gonna die right if you have the ability to bring it into a garage it's well worth it okay um there's a guy here in indianapolis um who grows 50 different varieties on his little urban plot and he pulls them into a garage every winter and he gets bits all of them so they're all popular yes yep so again he grows 50 different varieties so you could definitely do that if you want to bring it inside i mean one's okay i'm not sure i look at it right and again yeah it's really on it um but i i i'm not as familiar with these warmer growth ones but they probably need to go through a slight dormancy all right so here's the fix okay okay um one of the things that i know mimi did when she started to see the things and it was getting really late in the fall you know to kind of enhance ripening she actually plucked a lot of the leaves off so they could get more sun um lee reich in his book talks about you can enhance potentially quicken the ripening by putting a little drop of oil on the eye so you can see you know an olive oil or something right there at that little point that little eye that supposedly is supposed to help enhance the ripening um but yeah she got fresh drinks so that's pretty cool so let's talk um a little bit about thinking outside the box so if you've ever write a usd sarid grant or any grant whatsoever it's i've been writing grants for a long time in my capacity at niu you always want to think what if what if this doesn't work what can be salvaged from this because people who are reviewing grants and they're going to give you money they want to know that it's worth something in some form fashion whether it's education or can you get something else out of this and so when we wrote this grant we really kind of thought about outside the box what happens if we do all of this and we just can't get a lot of right things you know we don't want farmers to go through all of this and all of a sudden say gosh you know i invested all this money i did all this work and now i have nothing to take to market so thinking outside the box um we put in the grant that we would look at some other value added things that could come out of these figs even if we didn't get ripe figs or didn't get very many right things so it turns out that you can make some value added products from um fig trees whether you get ripe or unripe figs or not at all so you can definitely make jam jams from ripe figs if you are familiar with uh dylan farm they make something called the frog jam which is fig orange uh fr raspberry she i think is great so they blend three different fruits and make this fantastic jam if you've not tasted it i highly recommend uh going to your grocery store and looking for dylan you can also it turns out make jams from unripe figs and so this is one of those uh amy collected a bunch of unripe figs froze them down um i just got them from her yesterday or today and i'm going to go play around with some recipes i i know of one farm that has made um jam from unripe figs so i'm going to play around with that and see what that comes out to be but that's definitely a possibility you can make teas turns out figs whether it's the figs or the leaves are highly highly nutritional there's a lot of vitamins in them a lot of antioxidants um i can direct you to research uh published papers on that if you're interested um you can have you make a fig leaf tea at just the fig leaves alone um i know mimi you love just plain fig leaf tea um i collected fig leaves off of these figs and i blended them with some herbal uh dried herbal things that are often used in teas you're going to get to taste that today um so there's definitely a market there um i talked to a woman who owns a um she has an apothecary but she also has a wild food uh bar in greenwood it's open to the public and they make they make drinks and they make soups and things out of either wild foods or herbals and i said if we had farmers who could supply you with fig leaves would you be interested her eyes went oh yes so there are herbalists out there who would gravitate to this in a heartbeat if you produce this um we talked about living mulches that are a secondary crop so let's say you don't want to collect uh you don't want to make jam um but you got another living molt under there so you could eventually get um two things out of it you could get the tea leaf the leaves from the fig for teas you could have a secondary crop of something underneath whether it's strawberries or something else that somebody might be interested in there's also a fourth thing that i i'll just mention i don't know anyone doing it but um a sober mesa farm in bloomington um if you're familiar with that rwan carlos is from south america and in south america they use uh the sap which is a latex like um sap they use that medicinally for um skin growths wards and things like that just put a little data that sap on it and the world disappears so it's actually very traditional down there i'm sure not well researched here but something that that could potentially down the line be good use if you are allergic to latex then you may not want to be delving into that and if you are allergic to latex the teas are probably fine but you know don't risk it if you are allergic to latex um but you will get to taste some tea in a second all right so i talked about this early on um part of this grant also was an educational component and speaking here today as part of that um our we promised in our grant that we reach a wide range of farmers here and that's why i sent that little support around if you are a female farmer a military veteran farming or interested in farming or bipoc or you fall into more than one group um if you would just let me know so that i can give that feedback to sarah that would be wonderful um we will be giving more updates through the north american fruit explorers and the indiana fruit and nut growers association again we've got stuff up here to reflect from those groups those will probably be via zoom and i think um we'll try to have a field day some at some point next year this is a two-year grant so we need to do something in the field before the grant is over and then lastly we'll do some feedback you'll give me some feedback on the sampling of the tea today and with that um we want to thank usda and sarah for funding this project i think it's going to be really cool with um offering some new opportunities to our farmers here in the midwest the north american fruit explorers um they're the so when you do a partnership they typically want an entity that um kind of supports you so that all the the money routes through them so the north american fruit explorers graciously offered to do that for us they get nothing out of this they just are the conduit through which everything goes and then the indiana fruit and nut growers says nut fruit growers association um again they they help support all of our local fruit nut growing farmers and so um i i want to thank them too because they are allowing us to publish some stuff in in their journals and give talks and things like that so if you want to reach me my phone number's up there um i don't usually answer my phone you have to leave a message um you can also email me or you can reach me either through napex or the indiana nut fruit growers i'm the president of both and i am the one that sees most of those
