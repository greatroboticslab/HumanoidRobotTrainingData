 Today I'm going to take the slack out of a strand of barbed wire here on my fence that has gotten loose and I'm going to use this device called a wire tightener. This is a Jake's wire tightener. There are several brands. I'm not getting paid for promoting Jake's. That's just happened to be the one I have and I'm going to put it on here and tighten this strand of fence. That's all there is to it. Makes it tight as a banjo string.
