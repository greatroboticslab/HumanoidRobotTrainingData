 Today I want to share with you how I hash 200 chicks in a month as a small scale farmer and I hope this video will encourage someone out there who is just about to lose hope. Our master on the channel name is Esther Farm and I'm from Kenya East Africa. Continue supporting this channel and you'll be blessed. Now this is my coop as a small scale farmer. As you can see these are my lame hens. They are here and some of them are there out. These are the chickens that I use to produce my eggs so that I can incubate them and sell my chicks. As you can see there are not so many. But they are enough for my incubator and they are enough for my chicks. There are several types of improved Kenya ge breeds. We have like craters, Kenbro, Sasso and we have ring rooster and also we have curry. But for me here I have craters chickens. These are the chickens that give me my eggs that I incubate. I hash over 200 chicks per month and that is a good number considering that I am just a small scale farmer. And when I am not hatching sometimes I can sell the eggs to the people who want to hatch. Now this is where I brewed my chicks. And now I want to take you through the process of incubation. How I start. How I place my eggs in the incubator. So welcome as I show you the whole process until day 21 when the chicks are hatched. Welcome. I first start by collecting my eggs and storing them well until they are enough for my incubator. And I incubate eggs that are not more than 7 days for a good hatching. Because more than 7 days their hatching ability is low. That is why I prefer eggs that are not more than 7 days. After now collecting enough eggs for incubation. Now I select the good ones like eggs with no cracks. I select also broken eggs. And I try to wipe the dirt ones with a piece of cloth. And also look for medium sized eggs. Because sometimes large eggs cannot hatch. Because most of the times it has a double york. And it cannot hatch. Also I check whether it has one side with a sharp pointed head. Because the loud eggs they also don't hatch. So you have to select that so that you get a good percentage of chicks when they hatch. After now I am satisfied with my eggs. I put them in my incubator. My incubator holds 256 eggs. So you have to arrange them pointing one side. Like the way I am doing here. You have to arrange them to point one side. So that they can be able to hatch well. So that they can be able to hatch well. That is what I do. I have an incubator with 4 compartments. So I arrange them the way they are. The same thing I am arranging here. Is what I am going to do to the other compartments. So that the eggs can face on one side. You should not put. Like some of them are facing the other side. The other eggs are facing the other side. So they should face one side. So that they can hatch. And you should keep. You should put. Only the ones that are going to be enough in your incubator. So that to give space for turning the eggs. Connect the wire to the mortar. And this wire. Is the one that helps. To roll the egg. To turn the eggs. Then after you have finished. Make sure that. You close your incubator tight tray. So that the temperatures. And humidity is kept at the right way. If you don't close your incubator well. The problem might occur during the incubation period. And you won't get good number of sheets. So be careful. And close tight tray. Then you turn the upper cover. That has insulator. That help the incubator to restore heat. In case of breakout. The incubator will still have heat. Now you switch on your incubator. And you need to set. Your humidity and temperature. As per your incubator. Now like this one. You need to set. Your humidity and temperature. As per your incubator. Now like this one. You need to set. Your humidity and temperature. Your humidity and temperature. Now like this one. The first day. The temperature should be 38 degrees Celsius. And relative humidity 60%. From day 7 to 12. The temperature should be 37.8 degrees Celsius. And relative humidity 55%. From day 13 to 18. The temperature should be 37.6 degrees Celsius. And humidity should be 60. And 19 days after the temperature. Should be 37.2 degrees Celsius. And relative humidity should be 65. But all this depends. With your incubator. From day 7. This is the time. You need to do card ring. And this is checking. Whether the eggs. Has started developing. An egg blower. And at this time. From day 1. To day 18. The eggs will turn. But from day 19. Remove your eggs. From the rollers. And put them on the. Hashing trays. And on day 21. Hashing will turn. But from day 19. Remove your eggs. From the rollers. And put them on the. Hashing trays. And on day 21. Hashing will start. And you will get. Your cheeks. Now this is how the. Incubator looks like. When it is fully connected. And you need to keep. Checking the humidity. And temperature. According to the days. And if the humidity is slow. You need to add water. And I add water. On the holes below. To legume. To legume. To legume. And then. The heat. The heat. The heat. And the heat. The heat. When the heat. The heat. The heat. The heat. The heat. The heat. To regulate. The temperature. And humidity. This is. There is a way. Of. Mishling water. Depending on. The artifice. You get. From where. You get. Your incubator. This incubator. Is AC. And DC. And that means. It can use. Either electricity. Or. It can use. Solar. System. After 21 days. The hair. The eggs. Are hashed. And you remove. The cheeks. From the incubator. And transfer. Them. To the bluder. Where you. Keep them. And blued. Your cheeks. With enough warmth. And water. And also feeds. For at least. A month. Then you can. Remove them. And keep them. Somewhere else. To get. Enough space. Cheeks. Are so delicate. And should. Be. Huddled. With. Great care. And especially. You. Supply. Them. With. Enough heat. So. In a. Bruder. You should. Have. A. It sauce. Yours. You can. Also. Use. Bulbs. Bruder. Gicos. Customers. Place. Oders. And I. Hush. For. Them. And I. Find. This. A. Good.
