 so i was unloading head i just found this dog hi baby well never a dull day at the farm it's a dog party in bed good morning everyone say good morning delilah that's her way of saying good morning i am taking you guys along my whole day you guys have asked what do i do and what my life is like uh every morning i wake up around seven in the morning with these two delilah and benelli who's begging for my food as if it's gonna fall on the counter they already ate their breakfast i took them on a walk it's about 7 30 here now now after since i've just got done making my coffee and all that fun stuff i'm going to get dressed and then head to the farm because we all know i don't live at the farm i live about 20 minutes away from there so let's get this day started and you guys are able to come along and see what my life is like good morning d you say every morning i go out on the patio and i bark at the neighbors but nelly begs for my breakfast and sometimes delilah actually reaches it so she'll probably push it back and she'll steal my breakfast and share with benelli sometimes and going back out to the patio we're following mommy to get dressed come on now benelli swears that the food's gonna fall for her look as if a ghost is magically gonna push the food down and she's going to be able to eat it come on now 20 minutes later still trying to get my sandwich no benelli it has ham in it now they're both biting great i just got in the car i had to literally move all these bags of green and cat food from that vehicle to this vehicle and load all this stuff in here into this vehicle from that vehicle so that took me a little bit and it is freezing here i know you guys are gonna say it's not that cold but in florida we're not used to this weather it's 41 degrees here but let's go to the farm this is my favorite part getting stuck behind tractors this is like the mile road the six mile road to the farm there's a little bunny walking into the gate i have to open the gate to pull the truck in the sun's so bright but we're here at the farm i'm going to unload all the stuff i have in the truck the first part of my day even though i just unloaded my last vehicle i have to reload unload this one oh my gosh guys look a little baby bunny is hiding behind this bush let me see if i can catch it for all the tater fans there's tater bunny look at this little black baby how cute i want to try to capture it no way it's way too fast but i know everyone loves look how cute that is oh my gosh how adorable for all the tater fans everyone that loves the tater bunny he's right there there's bp and oreo and then look how cute is that though oh tater's definitely like the king of all the bunnies he bosses everyone around and then we have some new babies down here let's see there's the mama i actually did put a bunny in a stall last night because she looked a little sad which i'm probably gonna end up taking her home she's actually super sweet i just felt like she wasn't getting enough attention hi baby look how sweet she is remember how i told you guys the jobs never end well this water line hose snapped i would turn it on but i would get sprayed with water and i don't want to be wet all day so i have to redo this the crack is like right here but if i was to turn it on it would literally go all over me so i have to replace this water line i mean obviously you guys can see i've replaced it plenty of times and done kind of a lazy job so i'm going to fix it the right way today but first i have to turn the well off so the water doesn't go everywhere when i snip the line so the well is up here in this pasture and to turn it off you're gonna go like this it's off so what i'm gonna do snip it down here i hope i don't get super hard water on me cool what i just realized is that i could save this piece so i'm going to make it like this because i thought this little twisty thing was cool i mean i could do it short but i'm gonna make a longer one so i need a cuplink just right here this one will work i hate this glue it gets everywhere and it sucks when it gets on you so what we're gonna do is we're gonna cuplink this try not to get it on you because it sucks getting it off one part done i like to use a lot of glue so it stays if you all can't tell okay cool great and what i need to do is now cut another pvc pipe up here to adapt to this part i'm like the messiest worker ever when it comes to doing this stuff at least i try it measure it out so we'll go ahead and do this part first and get more glue all over me why katrina why are you so messy when you do this stuff it never fails i'm literally always covered in this stuff but acetone takes it off so like this whoop okay but guys check out this water line compared to the new one i would say it looks pretty good what i have to do still is take my drill and then just click it on here so the horses don't play with it because the horses love to break these apparently especially during the winter time the pipes freeze all the time and look fam's probably on his way over here to mess it up so i do do pretty much all the water line fixes on the farm i actually was here digging all the water lines with the guys that dug them here so i can learn how to do it if we ever did have a break because that's part of owning a farm shut the front door did i not fix it properly i was like tell me i didn't tell me i fixed it right and i realized it was coming from here so i did good job katrina go water line girl tilly decided to join me and keep me company i'm jumping over oh my gosh don't fall don't fall okay so i could fill this water drop up and the water line is fixed me and jackie were just talking about there are so many bunnies here at the farm i literally just like came over here and walked under the pergola and there's like 20 babies like there are so many bunnies we literally have like no bunnies like three months ago and today we have a zillion look at little bam running around he's so cute literally just look at him he's been like scratching himself he's so funny oh my gosh bam your personality boy is hilarious jackie goes i'm really starting to like these shavings but every time this drips where does it drop it drops see it's like in the cracks and what does it do it drops oh my god it drips by my forehead see you too you're in the right spot oh so so far i've fixed water lines unloaded horse grain gave a cat medicine which i didn't record um now i have to deworm all the horses go pick up horse hay do a couple more things drill in some boards that the horses broke but my day has been already kind of long and i still it's only 10 o'clock so i have a lot more stuff to do so hang tight and let's go go jackie dance all right now that i have all my errands at the farm done i am running to go get horse hay for the horses i have to get peanut hay and tifton hay for in the barn which are bales that we give in the stalls at night time when the horses are turned in or when the horses are turning during the day so let's go to circle h check it out i have to unload all this hay by myself it's 12 bales we feed tifton and peanut hay here they each the horses that are in the stalls get a flake of each it's gonna be fun who's dog is that hi buddy so i was unloading ahead i just found this dog hi mama you

were at the farm i don't know who's they are but we're gonna keep them here in the stall till we find the owners and make sure they go back home right guys because they look well fed one has a collar but no tag so i'll go to like the local gainesville pet finder and um try to find where their owners are well while we look for the owners for these puppies i'm gonna go back to doing the hay but

jackie come with me to go get jay bangs up in lake city which is an hour drive the reason why i go up there to get shavings is because it saves a lot of money and i don't want this guy to waste his wood shavings so i go and pick them up once a month and we are headed that way now remembered what jackie reminded me i have to run in and grab garbage bags from home depot because that is one thing i do bring for the guy so he doesn't have to buy because he's already giving me shavings so i'm in here at home depot looking for garbage bags and where are they we're in action lake city we're coming for you farm stuff never ends hold up here and i was like jackie just move the truck if someone comes and yells at you because i'll be two seconds oh all right garbage bags we're ready get all these
