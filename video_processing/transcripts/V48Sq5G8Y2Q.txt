 hey guys it's ann welcome to the channel if you're new here this is a indoor worm farming channel and this is my experimental bin that i am trying to see how many inputs it takes to get to my final batch of castings so right now what we're looking at is 21.3 pounds and i'll put kilograms down there below so we're going to jump right in and i'll put below what the weight was when we left last time in general we've been losing about a pound and a half of water probably i mean there could be carbon dioxide losses etc so yeah there could be carbon dioxide losses ammonia losses whatever um but for the most part we have noticed that it has been moisture related at this moment everything looks very very wet i think the bubble wrap has been doing more than its job to keep this nice and moist for the worms so they can reproduce and eat properly so i'm gonna kind of dig in here i am seeing cocoons in here so they are reproducing and the worms are looking nice and wiggly this is a mix of my red wiggler and european nightcrawler and blue worms that is in blue and nowhere else except for this one right now last time we came in we actually fed a liter of pumpkin on each side now i'm not seeing anything over here maybe a few little orange flecks but now we're gonna go over to this side where we fed all of the new leaves to give them some bedding now put in the comments below what do you think it's going to take in the amount of inputs over the course of the next i don't know it's been a couple of months since we started this i'm probably going to go all the way to spring and we'll see you know the weight of the castings at a particular moisture and i'll check to see what percentage of moisture it is and then we'll see what we get in the way of castings so i have been measuring everything separately so i've been measuring the volume of the food as well as the mass of the food and the water and the bedding so everything should be accounted for and then when we come in week over week actually month over month at this point and looking in on the worms what we're doing is seeing what did we lose as far as weight goes over the course of that time and it's been nearly a month since we checked in on this bin so i'll put all the numbers below but they did eat almost all their food they've got quite a bit in the way of uh shredded coconut coir and leaves in here and i do still see a little bit of potato but it looks like other than that the moisture is doing really well which uh i'm going to have to drain off some of the moisture on the food that i brought down for them because i don't really think it needs it it's quite wet okay so this is what they're getting and this should total about one gallon of food or about four liters and this is going to be a combination of avocado and tomato and we'll put that on this side now they're actually getting the whole avocado i had purchased some that never did ripen after about a month so they might have been picked a little bit too early or something so we're going to put that over on that side and then the rest of the gallon of food we'll put back over on this side and then we will weigh what everything is next yes i did forget to weigh this separately but with a little bit of worm math i can figure out what i've put in here so this is bananas and bread and more avocados no water additions this time so let's see what the weight is up to now 26.5 pounds so we've added about five pounds of food in one gallon and i'll put the metric conversions in there i'm going to add a little bit of grit because i don't think that avocado is going to be easy to eat i do tend to forget to do things like this for some reason but i am going heavy especially on something that's going to be as hard to digest as the avocado flesh so hopefully that will be enough food to get them going for the next three weeks or so until i can get back in here again here we are the final weight of 27.1 pounds so if you're thinking this is a very cool experiment i have a whole playlist just for this experiment which i will link over there and if you've already seen that youtube thinks you're gonna like that video right over there all right guys thanks for hanging out with me and my worms and everybody have a good day
