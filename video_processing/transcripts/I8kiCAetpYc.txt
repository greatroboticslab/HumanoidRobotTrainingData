 G'day guys, Wayne Perkins here. Just come down to have a look at this react pump that's down the bottom of New Zealand in Wyndham in Southland. It's a ripper day but it always is down in Southland. So Gary got this here going and we sent it to him I think around about June. He's run it mainly for the winter, it's for his block up, just got a pump water about 110 meters up the hill for his cattle and so really just needs it in the winter so it's not running today. So what he did he's got a four panel system which is an 11 20 watt system. He's got him set up there across the road so he can get good sun. Cable and come down, he's dug the cable under the road, the pump's down here. We've got about a two meter suction lift from a good source down there and it's been a good result pumping 100 meters up two meter suction lift, four panel system giving good quantities of water. The pump's going well we're really proud of this pump and look if you're looking for something on your farm if you need to push water up a hill and you know you've got no power around and you're interested in some solar give us a call you know the react pump it's going pretty well there's some people out there pretty happy with it and I'd love to talk to you. Cheers.
