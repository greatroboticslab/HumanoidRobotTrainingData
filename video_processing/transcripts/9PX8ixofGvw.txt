 Welcome to our channel today. We're excited to explore one of the most familiar yet surprisingly unique agricultural products, the onion. How exactly are these small bulbs transformed into juice? Join us as we step into the world of dedicated farmers and modern processing plants. To uncover each fascinating step of this journey, onions are a globally popular crop with leading producers including China, India and the United States. Every year, these countries harvest and export millions of tonnes of onions with China at the forefront, producing nearly 24 million tonnes annually, accounting for over 20% of the world's total production, India, follows closely with around 19 million tonnes. These countries play a crucial role in supplying onions to major markets, particularly in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. The journey of an onion begins in the fields where it is cultivated and cared for through an agricultural process tailored to its specific growth needs. Onions thrive in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil, requiring plenty of sunlight and moderate water to develop vigorously in modern agriculture. Farmers have embraced the use of automated onion planting machines to sow seeds efficiently, significantly reducing the amount of manual labour required, and enhancing overall productivity. These state-of-the-art machines are designed to place seeds or small onion sets into the soil with remarkable precision, ensuring they are positioned at the optimal depth and spaced at consistent distant intervals. Guarantees that each onion plant has adequate room to grow, minimising the risk of overcrowding, and promoting healthier, more uniform crop development throughout months of careful tending. Onions grow strong beneath the ground, with roots reaching deep for nutrients, while green stems rise above to support this growth. Automated irrigation systems provide the exact amount of water needed, keeping the soil consistently moist without oversaturation. During this time, farmers use a combination of organic and traditional pest control methods to keep the onion plants healthy and thriving. After approximately three to four months from planting onions, is ready for harvest. Choosing the right timing is crucial, as harvesting too early will yield immature onions lacking flavour, while a delayed harvest may lead to spoilage. Typically, when the green onion tops begin to fall over onto the ground, it's a clear sign that the onions are ready to be harvesting onions with machinery marks, a remarkable advancement in agriculture, saving significant time and labour. Modern harvesting machines are designed to lift onions with precision, gently removing them from the ground without causing damage. The machines then clean off excess soil and neatly arrange the onions for easy transport. This automated process is not only accelerates the harvest, but also ensures that onions are collected clean and intact, ready for further processing and storage after being harvested. The onions are transported to processing facilities, where the transformation into onion juice begins. The first step is cleaning, where the onions are placed on a conveyor belt and thoroughly washed under pressure, nozzles and soaking tanks to remove any dirt or remaining impurities. Once cleaned, the onions are prepared for the juicing process. These preparation steps not only ensure hygiene, but also optimise extraction, preserving the natural flavour and nutritional nutrition of the onions in the final product. After completing the cleaning process, the onions are transferred to industrial juicing machines. Here, the fresh onions are crushed and pressed to extract pure juice. This pressing process must ensure that the juice is efficiently filtered, retaining all the natural nutrients from the onions to improve the texture and smoothness. Consistency of the juice workers may add a small amount of natural powder, such as rice or corn flour. This powder not only enhances the mouth feel, but also helps keep the product stable, preventing separation during storage. Additionally, a small amount of sugar syrup may be added to create a harmonious colour, making the juice look more appealing. The juice is also used to be added to the juice. The juice is heated to sterilise it, eliminating any harmful bacteria while maintaining the nutritional value. And distinctive flavour of the onions. Following the processing, the juice is transferred to an automatic bottling system, ensuring that each bottle is consistent and safe. The juice bottles are sealed and labelled with complete product information, complying with strict international standards in preparation for export to various markets worldwide. Onion juice is not only a nutrient-rich beverage, but also offers numerous health benefits. It can contain natural anti-inflammatory and antibacterial compounds that help support the body in boosting the immune system and fighting infections.
