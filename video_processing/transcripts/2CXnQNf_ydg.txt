 This is day one of the great challenge. So our first job today is to level the field. Now Lee, why is leveling the field so important and how do we do this? For wet seeded rice you're dealing with a seedling that is two days old, young and very fragile. And there's the two most important criteria you've got to meet early are water control and weed control. And in some ways they're one and the same. So by leveling you can ensure that each seedling has a consistent amount of water or a consistent lack of water depending on what you're trying to achieve at the time. So we really think leveling the field is the very first and most important step probably to get a good crop established particularly if it's wet seeded rice as we want to do in our agronomy challenge this year. Yes, we're targeting a high yield and for a high yield we need a good establishment density. We need a good number of plants in the field. So we need a good survival of and growing of the seeds that we will put out with the drum seeder in two days time. And leveling is definitely the foundation upon which a good high yield is built. And how does that laser leveling thing work here? We have a big tractor, we have an attachment back there. Well what does it actually do? Right, well there's two electronic implements talking to each other. The first implement is transmitting a signal over there at the other side of the field. It's sending a laser beam at a completely level grade. The second device is picking up that beam and ensuring that the implement, the rotavator, is travelling along the field at a consistent height. So if it's travelling at a consistent height it's leaving the soil at a consistent height. So it's achieving that final leveling we're looking to have. Yeah Lee I don't know what you think but I think you've done a great job. This looks pretty levelled to me. I think it's satisfactory. My levelling coach at the other end of the field, he assures me that this levelling task is complete. The levelling is satisfactory. So we are ready to drum seed in two days time to seed the field. Fantastic, see you back in two days. Thank you.
