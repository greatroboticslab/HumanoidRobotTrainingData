 We brought you a brand new tractor! No way. Now instead of people doing manual work like this, they can instead just use this tractor. What previously took 45 minutes will now just take 45 seconds. This tractor is more important than you may realize. Just because we're taking the money from all the views on this video and giving it to school meal programs doesn't mean food just magically spawns out of thin air. The food has to come from somewhere, and in this case, it's coming from the increased yield on this tractor across this massive farm.
