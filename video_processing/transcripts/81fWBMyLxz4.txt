 Okay getting ready to get the drill loaded up and set up to reseed the grass hay pasture. Adjusted the depth of the gauge wheels and the disc openers. It's a half inch. Let's go up here and show you this. So I've mixed together oats and grass pasture seed. I forget what the varieties are. There's some fescue, timothy, some other. And then there's the leftover wheat. Still on the bottom of the drill. I'll kind of sort it all together. I gotta say I love the feeling of just running your fingers through all the seed. I have enough to do about three four acres here. I saved the seed from the last time I did this earlier in the spring. And then in the grass seed box is clover seed. Medium red clover. I'll send that down. I forgot what it looks like. That goes up here in the grass seed box. And there's still some leftover berseem clover. Frosty berseem clover from when I was drilling the wheat. So that's what's to come. And down there in a pallet. There's 11 bags left of the 295 that I had of wheat, spring wheat. So I've got a neighbor who says he'll buy them from me for half price. And over there. Dog and the corn. A pallet of corn. We're getting to plant in about two weeks. So that's it for this one. I've got to pull the grain card out and the trailer behind the tractor. So I've got some projects here in the next couple days. Thanks for watching. We'll see you soon. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. sist
