 Soil health you know isn't just one thing it's like a system approach I mean for us it's combining no-till crop rotation cover crops and then planning like native grass species in our sensitive areas in our wetlands and our salinity areas and along our watersheds to try to make our land not only profitable but sustainable for the future it's a way to pull carbon out of the air and put it in the ground and carbon and organic matter are basically the same thing so if I can pull carbon out of the air and put it in the ground I'm making the soil healthier we're not seeing the salt issues as bad we're also not seeing the mud when we go into plant if you take care of the soil it'll take care of you how do we manage not only the native prairie soils but how do we manage the crop ground to get our soil structure back to where it should be that's the real challenge that we have I think the first step is to understand and gain an understanding of what we're dealing with in the native prairie soils building a resilient soil if it's wet if it's dry if it's cold if it's hot I want to get a soil that protects me within those situations or is able to handle those situations without costing me a crop there's so many living things there and when you go out there and dig when with the living cover it just looks alive you're gonna save money on fuel you're gonna save money with the fertilizer because that's staying where you put it long run you're gaining yield because you're increasing the value of the land it also helped our workload issues it allowed a better quality of life for me and my family and as it turns out it's a better quality of life for the soil it's better for the cows as well diversity is always improves the biological health and actually cattle preferred diversity rather than monocultures we've made a real push to involve our landowners on the land that we rent and lease to to get involved in to understand what we're doing we have a pretty good crop rotation that we're happy with we're trying to have the soil covered pretty much all the time feeding the soil so pulling carbon dioxide out of the air through photosynthesis and feeding soil microbiology increasing our soil organic matter it is accepting the responsibility to continue to spread the word and to share the things that you've learned over the years share the the knowledge the successes the failures of what it's all about it's about leaving it better than you found it long term my kids talk about farming they they love being out here you know and i that's up to each one of them if they want to do this or not i hope one or two of them decide to come back and run the farm you
