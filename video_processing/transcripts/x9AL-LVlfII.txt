 Music You know a lot of buzz in the industry now is the weeds that you're not killing with herbicides. You know well we really don't have on our farm we really don't have a lot of problems with that. And I think that can be attributed to using you know the small grains in the rotation and keeping it diverse. And because of that diversity in your crop rotation you also have a diversity in your herbicides that you can choose. Right. You know whether your pre's or your post's you know and so you've got multiple layers there for weed suppression. Right. And so it all works together. So I'm assuming you're making savings on inputs as well, herbicides is that correct? Yeah and part of that is just because we don't have the weed pressure. Yeah. And so we don't have to go out there more than twice a year to knock these weeds back. Right. And still have escapes. Yeah. You know it's pretty much by placing your pre and then if you have to do a post your field is clean. Got a diverse mix now of radish, vetch and lentils. You know you've got this natural action from these plants that are digging deep down breaking up compaction. While still providing those nutrients in that zone for the next year. And those roots for that next year's crop does not have to look very far to find those nutrients that it needs. So I'll see you later. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
