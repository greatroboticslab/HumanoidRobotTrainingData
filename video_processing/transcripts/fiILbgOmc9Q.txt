 Good morning everybody, thanks for being here. This is another seminar in quite a series that we have been organizing and actually I want to take the opportunity to thank Isabel for following up on the seminars. If you have any idea for your own to present or any speaker you think should come and give a seminar, you can always float the idea. Today we invited Luc Dendove. Luc Dendove is a very esteemed colleague with whom we have been working over the past years in a very fruitful collaboration between CIMIT and CIMBESTAV. When you see some of the numbers about publications coming out of the long-term trial infrastructure, the long-term trials we have here in Mexico, part of those publications come from student collaborations that we have been doing together with CIMBESTAV and Luc's research team. What I always say is the uniqueness is Luc has a lot of nice ideas, nice research tools that we don't have and we have the long-term trials that can actually be the background or can generate the story through using those insights that are way more upstream than what we are doing. Luc has a very long and recognized career. He started its work at the University of Loven, then was quite some time active in Rotomstedt, and finally landed in Mexico in CIMBESTAV where he is still leading one of the most important research teams on carbon-nitrogen cycling and recently micro-organism processes, but I'm sure he will explain that way better than I can do. So thank you and let's give a round of applause. Thank you. ...but okay, that's the title of my talk. I mentioned that at the bottom because if you read some of the earlier papers then people try to give certain characteristics to bacteria and I try to show you that, for instance they are copiotrophic, they are oligotrophic. I'm not sure about that anymore. I think bacteria are much more flexible. I don't know if soil characteristics are important in that. It might be competition, it might be predators. I'm not sure about it. So I try to explain it to you. This is our paper that is ready to submit. It's a collaboration between different institutes, some younger researchers working in Blazcala and working in Polytechnico. We mentioned it already. It's rather a good collaboration. I'm quite proud of it. We have now 31 published peer review manuscripts. We got 745 citations. Some of 30 citations come from some very important papers Bram wrote. We have an index of 14. So I'm quite pleased with this collaboration. We have quite a lot of other papers ready to submit. Okay. We know that agriculture practices affect yields and soil characteristics. We studied some of these in El Batan and Obregon. But I focus mostly on El Batan. There's been one pitfall in El Batan. These are some of the results of changes in soil characteristics. We have one problem in El Batan. I mentioned it immediately. We got two replicated plots. So if you do an analysis, a statistical analysis, then you get problems because the variation is rather great. So often you see clear cut effects. They are not significant. So yeah, some of the problems. That's one of the commands of the last paper that we submitted. He doesn't even know it is accepted. But this is a command I often receive. So I try to explain to the reviewer about what to do. Is it an analysis? And we know, we know. We know. But I'm a bit worried about it. Because it returns and returns. That's why we try to work in Obregon. Problem of the problem. Obregon is that if we want to get some soil samples and extract DNA, that becomes difficult. And if we want to extract RNA, then it's even more. Okay. We were expecting that these differences, especially in organic matter, would have a large effect on carbon and nitrous mineralization. This is a very simple representation of the aerobic incubation we do. We got some soil. We trap carbon dioxide. And we measure in the soil mineral N. And now recently we start to extract DNA to see what is happening there. Another command that I was not really aware of is that if you start to work with bacteria, then you have non-parametric data. I've never, well, did a lot of research on soil characteristics. Parametric, but bacteria, if you count, they're non-parametric. And again, if you try to do some analysis, then, yeah, significant difference is rather difficult to obtain. Because non-parametric are more stringent, if I can say it like that. Okay. So, I said I would mention the problems we were encounter. These are some results of carbon and nitrous immunization. You see not a lot of differences between your treatments, although you have a difference in carbon content. And I compare that with Broadbork and Rothamsted, where after, how long is it? More than 160 years. You really have a big difference in carbon and nitrogen immunization because your carbon content is extremely different. I just want to mention, you know that David Jenkinson published a paper on microbiome as carbon. There's no replicator Broadbork. So, if you look at the data on his original paper, then there's no replicates there. Additionally, he includes one soil. And you look at the line. So, but anyway, I think a very important paper, but I have some questions. Anyway, we didn't detect a big difference in carbon nitrogen immunization. We did some measurements also in the field. We did that quite a while ago. And that was one of the problems we faced on certain paper on carbon dioxide emissions, and nitrous oxide emissions, and methane emissions. That review was pointing out you only have two replicates. Okay. This is the light to you in the field. We don't have a lot of difference. We are asking the difference in the lab. So, we think it's a long time between the effect of conservation agriculture versus the invention between the effect of carbon immunization and nitrogenization. But okay, you have these data. You have these differences. So, what is the effect of these differences on microbial population? And this is a principle component analysis. And it's a, you try to get all your data on bacterial groups. You try to correlate them and you... ...or whatever. So, what you get is, you get a clear separation between permanent beds, between conventional beds. And what do you get in conventional beds? You get copiotrophs, which are organisms that like fresh organic materials. So, they consume it. They degrade it. They mineralize it. And if you go to the program that you got organisms that are nutrient depleted. The volcanic material has to come down as... ...might be questionable as a word, because normally it has more to do with nutrients than with volcanic material, but I use it here also for organic material. So, if there's a microbiologist, I apologize for using that, because some people are very... ...to use it to use it. So, people working in microbiology and bacteria... ...and... ...and... ...and... ...and... ...and... ...they're rather easy to isolate. If you read papers on isolation of microorganisms from soil, you will mostly find... ...we not... ...but most of these... ...acidobacteria is a huge group of microorganisms, but we only have isolated... ...without... ...without... ...without... ...without... ...why is that? It's all very difficult to grow... ...on agar or... ...in the plus. So, it's clear now that the agriculture practices do affect our micro-populations. As I mentioned, permanent beds, they favor these groups, which are oligotrophs that prefer... ...I think this is the opposite. They prefer nutrient-rich, this should be reversed, but anyway. And then we have conventional beds, where we get these organisms that prefer organic rich environments. Why? Because if you have conventional beds, then you... ...we need to organic... ...deal on top. There's no direct contact between you. ...or very slow... ...or very low... ...or very low... ...okay. ... ...to conventional practices, conventional... ...I always have questions. Is this for real? Do you have changes over time? Are my results correct? Because you always have this problem of technique. And what do I mean by technique? So, when we did these first analysis, we had clones. We had about 150 sequences of DNA. And then we went to Pyro, which is about 100,000 sequences. And now we go to Illumina, and then we can talk about whatever you want. 400 million, 200 million. So the question is always, there's an evolution. It's quite exciting, because we're fed up with carbon and nitrogen in the realisation. But then we always have the problem of, can I compare really my results without saying a couple of million over the world? So what we started an experiment this year, trying to collect salt samples over the year. And we want to look at population. We try to look at certain processes also, because it's one of the critiques you can have on this work. It's very descriptive. What is this all about? What are you really doing? What is the importance of all this? And I would say we try to start with getting the techniques right, and then we can start to focus on some questions we have. So I'll mention some questions at the end of my talk. But we want to focus on nitrification and functionality. Functionality, starting with RNA from a soil is very difficult. If you look at literature, you will find some papers on it, but very little. The problem is soil conditions. And we are very lucky that Obregon, we succeed in extracting RNA. And Elbatan, forget about it. So you check the literature. It's the same way. I mentioned bacteria. Because extracting or amplifying DNA from fungi and microscopic two period is not so easy. Archaea, we can do it. But it's a borderline. So look at the literature. You will see some papers. But if you try to compare, because we published a paper on fungi in Sonora and microscopic eukaryota, there's nothing to compare it really. Fungi, it's okay. You have some. But microscopic eukaryota, very little. Okay. If we have the question about copiotrophs and non-carbons, then my idea was we get organic material. If we get organic material available, we'll get some copiotrophs. A rhizosphere is normally considered organic carbon. So what we are trying to do now, how are these two behaving in the hydrosphere? There's a lot of organic carbon. Is that why we are correcting the two of these in which environments? And also, if we apply organic material, a crop residue to the soil, who's going to degradate that organic material? Okay. This is recently recent. And I haven't gone into all the details. But we did, we met population, vegetative flowering, grain filling. So the bulk soil rhizosphere, this dynamics a bit. And then again, this, another rather interesting development. I always used to work with SAS. And people convinced me that error is much better. It is a magnificent tool, but it takes some time first to adjust to it, because SAS is very straightforward. Error is a bit strange if you're not used to it. Another problem I see with error, I can do this, this graph, so, well, the results were obtained in R.I. and then put it in Excel, because I don't like the graphs. But you have about six or seven packages that can do this. And it's, I get lost sometimes. SAS is easy. It's straightforward. It's always the same. But the problem is that all these biological techniques, they don't exist. And in error, you've got all these updates, well, daily, I think. So my advice is people really want to work in bioinformatics. Go to error or phyton. I don't know phyton because they're trying to convince me also to start working in phyton. I don't know. Presumably I will end up doing it. But anyway. But we get some clear changes again in population in the rhizosphere. So, and R.D. holds more or less. I mentioned that there in error, but I'm not sure if it will all give better results. But, and this is also very recent, although I think the program, all this was, they started to write it when we were in Oak Ridge. They mentioned it. This is where you've got your bacteria identified with ribosomal DNA. Sorry. And then you try to link these populations to functions. And that is very interesting because otherwise you've got 600 or 1,000 species. Bloody hell, what are they doing? Okay, I know bacillus and I know pseudomonas and I know aegis and I know that. But this becomes interesting. Now I think they're developing it because RNA is not so easy to extract. But I hope we can link this with RNA. This is heat. I said it's just so hard to go through it. Maybe there are some other graphs in there when you compare it. I think compared to it. But I said it's just, I did it two days ago. And then this is another experiment. These are all incubations over time. So if you see these seven and 14, normally we have about 260, 250 data points. And then you see here we added bean material. This is unamended. And then you see that the bean, the population, there's a shift in population. The story is I apply organic material and there's a shift in my population. Okay. As I said, we can confirm. What we found in conventional physics in the world conservation area. But as always, once you get some answers to your question, there's no other question in the world conservation area. And that is, as I said, the paper of fear in 2007. They defined certain groups as being oligotrophs and certain groups being copiotrophs. And then you compare actinobacteria, this group, what is it, micrococasea, and then you've got here, gaylelasea. And then you see these are favored by organic material you applied and the others not. So, the idea, yeah, it's not working. So, I think it would be rather difficult to say that one bacterial group has these characteristics. So, I have to mention when we go to species in bacteria, then we talk about 97% of similitude. Similitude, yeah. We differ from chimpanzees, I think, 0-3%. So, what are we talking about really? Okay. But we are aware of this problem, but we should sometimes not forget it. Okay. As I mentioned, these groups are very easy to isolate, so they are well described. But in a soil, they are normally not that important, only 3% of them. And then we got the other bacillus of 5%. So, what is all the rest doing? One of the other problems, when we write these papers, then normally we mention about 15 groups at the maximum. And normally you found between 500 and 1,000 ginnus. So, what all the rest is doing, we don't know. And we don't even want to talk about it because we would get a paper of I don't know how many pages. But anyway, so would you, the question was would soil characteristics affect our behavior of certain groups when we apply organic materials? So, we apply organic material in one system, which is conventional beds, we add it in permanent beds. So, we would hope that this group, which is acidobacteria EE, this is a very important group, but we don't know actually what it is doing. And then you see in permanent beds, when you apply bean material, their relative abundance increases. When you apply it to conventional beds, there is an effect of soil characteristics. So, we wanted to have some soil a bit more diverse to see how different bacterial groups respond to. And this, we used Elisa, we used Chinampa, and we used Texcoco. And then, this is quite nice. So, you get a complete separation of your different groups, different environments. Yeah, one of the problems I have is with canonical correlations. When I do a principal component analysis, it's very nice. I go to canonical and it's not so nice. So, my explanation is there's a factor defining this that I can't, well, I don't measure it. Or is it soil characteristics I'm not aware of that it's important? Or it's interaction between my populations in the given environment. But, I mean, I said I would mention the problems I see. But, okay, I think we can, and this is then in the different ecosystems. Now, you have the Chinampa, you have the Batan, Texcoco. And then you apply the material, how are these groups responding to the material. And then you see Bacillus, it's increasing. Why? It consumes the organic material. That's very well known. But then you start to see these groups like, oh, I think I missed that one. Which is rather well known group. And normally it is a copiotroth. However, in this system, in Texcoco, when I apply organic material, it participates in the degradation of the organic material. And when I look at Tel Batan, not at all. So, conclusion, these groups adapt themselves or they have the metabolic capacity. But the environment, the competition with other groups defines how they respond. Yeah? So, we made a little diagram of which organisms are favored along the gradient. So, we apply here some organic material. And we measured the populations. They're one, they're three, they're seven, 14, 20, it's 56. And then you see the groups that are favored. The relative abundance increase. And then there's Alomonas. And if we go to Batanda, we see the normal Bacillus. And some Steptomesis also along the line. Yeah. But you see there are different groups that are favored by degradation. Okay? I think I remember, if I remember correctly, Titius said that bacteria in soil normally keep the genetic capacity. They don't shed so much of the capacity as you will see in the reactor or in my stomach. You know, there's a quick interchange of genes in... So, this is again three systems. I apply the material. And you get a shift in your population. Okay. As I mentioned, this is all very well, very nice. You've got beautiful BCRs. And you say, oh, we've got a shift. But... It's all descriptive. So, uh... Can we learn from all this? First of all, I think we can use the techniques to find specific questions. And one of the specific questions we are trying to address now is an obregion. So, that's a problem with dry-sowing and wet-sowing. So, there is an injury that might be a biological problem. That... ...dermination... Plant emerges and plants stand decreased under dry-sowing, but not in wet conditions. Or we would treat them with a pesticide or herbicide or whatever, insecticides, fungicides then. So, we assume there's a problem there with... So, I think with all these techniques we now have, we try to look if it's really a biological problem we're facing. Okay? Well, that's not that difficult. But this is not that easy. Due to soil conditions. There are some people who extract to metagenomics or where you pay a lot and extract all the DNI and then you analyze everything. Yeah? It's rather cost... Costs a bit. But then you need... And I'll mention that later on. Then you need computer power and knowledge to all these pieces of 300 or 100 DNA spares to link them. That's not that easy. Neither. But anyway, what we're working on. As I mentioned... And then another study we started is to look at our populations. Why do we look at nitrified materials that are related to trace gas emission, greenhouse gas emission, nitrous oxide. Why do we focus on nitrifiers and not on denitrification? There are not that many. So we try to focus on something that is rather easy to study. Additionally, the genes or the proteins involved in the process are rather limited. However, for instance, AMOA, which is ammonium monoxygenase, where I thought there was one. Now there are already three different types. So if you want to look at these things, these processes, you have to consider all the possible genes. So we're looking at... We are looking at permanent beds, conventional, burnt. And then we have minus and plus. And we want to measure this. This is the first preliminary experiment. We'll put ammonium to these different sites. And what we see when... ... applied in the field, then you see that a lot of oxidation of ammonium. So you have a rather vivid or active nitrifier population, which is not that... Yeah? Okay, we want to measure... Or we'll measure that. We want to measure these gases. We want to measure biomass. We go for microbial structure, nitrifiers. This is not that complicated. As I mentioned, you already have three of them. I don't know how many I have of these. But then we want to... Hold on. Follow-up RNA. As I said, it's not that easy. Because it's much olfagin. You need to extract your RNA. And then you have to convert it to cDNA. And you're really interested in the genes or... Well, the expression of genes that are involved in the process. And... If you consider 95% of the activity is normal activity of the organism. It's not related to the process you're studying. You've got a bit of a needle in the hole, I think. So... It's not so evident. So we're trying to work on that. One of the things I haven't mentioned yet, but I think... With all the changes in techniques we have... Well, I mentioned it. We started 150 clones. Then we went to 100,000. And now I don't know how many. 200 million. You need a bit of computer power. And we're only starting with that. So... We'll start now. Since yesterday, I think. Finally, after two years of negotiating. We can have a new option within the department. Which we'll focus on bioinformatics. Statistics and supercomputing. One of the problems I see in statistics personally is time series. I mean, if you have a change over time, how do you compare these populations? What we normally do, what Richard Webster always told me, you just take the mean and compare the mean and that will be enough. And forget about all the rest. But I think we need some changes there. Supercomputers simply to get your metagenome together. Bioinformatics, yeah. There's a lot of dispute about the systems you've got your sequence. And then you have different systems to verify or check or identify the organisms it belongs to. And so you have certain journals that say we want that system. Europeans normally go for the European system. And the American system. And yeah, okay. But anyway, that's another of the questions we have. And then another thing we will try to do is we did a lot of these experiments with organic material copiotrophs, oligotrophs. We want to get it all together. It's about 20 experiments. We want to compare and see if all these data we have. Some bit of data mining. See, we can get something out of it. Okay. That's where we are at the moment. I must admit, as you can see, this is not my work. It's the work of a lot of people. And I haven't mentioned them all, but I would like to thank them. One of the advantages I think with Mexico, we have a lot of people. That's for sure. A lot of very enthusiastic people. Very capable people. Funding is not always that easy, but okay. We'll get along. And we have no access always to the most sophisticated equipment. But okay, these sequences, we send them out to microgen Korea. I don't know if you read about the German group who now extracts DNA from soil from our ancestors. Have you read about that? That now they can extract DNA from soil? Because all DNA doesn't dig redate in soil. So it is preserved. So if we look at Neanderthalus where they walked. Yeah, we can find traces of this DNA. Only mention it. The amount of soil you need to do this is not 20 grams like you do in El Batam. But it's a huge amount. And what these, sorry, these Germans have, they developed a robot. So you can assess or process an enormous amount of . But we have the people. They have the robot. We hope in 20 years' time the robot will be cheaper. But all the rest will be rather expensive. But anyway, I would be very, for the field experiment. I think what Bram mentioned is true. It's a unique, yeah, unique experiment. When I answer these questions, I only have two replicates. I always say it's the only field experiment in the tropics that I have access to. Okay, there are two replicates. But well-maintained experiments for more than 25 years, correct, Bram? You don't find them. So if you want to study these things, I mean, okay, it might be useless. I'm not sure what. Then you need something you can rely on. It's well done. Because if you go into the field and we compare whatever, El Batam, we compare forests, the variation is huge, enormous. Enough of you don't know what they did. So I am grateful for the experiment. And also when the money was short, they were more than willing to help me. I am in debt to silver stuff for the infrastructure. And of course, Cornacid was very generous with funding us. I think that's it. Yep. Thanks, Luke. And even that I was involved in the work, I still got some new ideas by seeing it presented like that. So as always, you keep us on our toes. Any questions from the audience? Please use the microphones because we have over, I don't know how many people, but several connected via the webinar. So if you can use the microphone. Ivan. Hi, Luke. Hi. Very interesting. I think I might have missed when you collect your soil samples to do your extractions. What depth or from what part of the soil are those soil samples? We normally work on the top soil layer. Why we do that is because we hope we have the biggest diversity. I know there are papers published that you have to be careful with the profile. I am well aware of that. But it all has to do with where do you want to focus on. If I set 200 samples to analyze, if I would go into profiles, then I get lost. It's always trying to, yeah. So that's 0 to 20? 0 to 15, 0 to 10, 0 to 20. It depends a bit. Yeah. But normally it's 0 to 10. And then I don't know if you could go back to the soil tests of the three different locations. Yeah. I don't know if I saw this cocoa with a pH of 9 something or maybe it wasn't pH, it went too fast. Is it too acidic? Too alkaline. But I think you have to, Tescoco is Tescoco Lake. Maybe give some more details on. Ah. Yeah, Tescoco, the pH of 9 is not here at the station, right? What, this? No, the one at the bottom. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, sorry. Oh, yes. Okay. I have to explain this. Because you have these differences in El Batán. We see a difference. And so we see an effect of what we do on our population. So to stress, to go in an excess of variation, we want to soils in the area. It's a Chinampa. It's in Chochimilco. Okay. And Texcoco, you got 9.4, which is not a lot. Because in Texcoco we have 10.5, but we want it to not be too extreme. You know what I mean? Is it a Texcoco Lake, right? Yeah, it's a Texcoco Lake. It's a lake. Yeah, yeah. And you have a huge salinity also. We did a lot of studies on Texcoco. That's why I included it. So El Batán is the, I think if I'm right, El Batán is the CEA plot from the long-term tribe. Chinampa is the Sochimilco, if I'm saying it right. And then Texcoco is the Texcoco Lake. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. And one last question. No, no. Please. What are the biofertilizers that are dealing with these bacteria and they're being inoculated into seed, etc.? Yeah. Well, this is not my, well, it's personal, but I'm not the only one who would say that. I remember David Jenkinson saying that. And I remember Martin Alexander saying that, and I agree completely. I think it would be very difficult. There are two reasons. First of all, you have an equilibrium. You have a system in equilibrium. You apply something. Organisms. It's food. Second, if you have a soil, you apply it. How are you going to apply it where you need it? I can imagine you fertilize a seed. And then you hope. We did some experiments. We did an experiment with Barcillos. And it was fantastic. It was the best. We had an effect for one month on the roots. And that was it. I'm actually doing an experiment with Mace, with one of the farmers who has this brilliant system of biofertilizer. And we sterilized his consortium. And in the beginning, the sterilized consortium gave better results than the consortium. There's another reason why I'm very skeptical. For this experiment, we checked the literature. Check the literature. And it tells you quite a lot. Where was it published? Which journals was it published? I get very doubtful. I remember in Leuven, Brown-node rule, but it was Carl Vlasak with Azospirillum in Brazil. And they had a positive result. So they published it. And they could never repeat it. So I am... But the experiment we're doing is we're using these techniques. We have now to look more at survival. So we have this consortium. We'll characterize it. We'll see what's happening. Problem is always, okay, I'm working in greenhouse. Because if I do it in a field, and again, you know the problems in the field. People do things you don't know. One of the other... That's the reason why I prefer to work with Simit. We started to work with some of the... Where is it? Yeah, in the road to Keretaro. I don't remember the name, Tepehi. What about Tepehi? I don't remember the village. And you try to collaborate. And then they call you and they say, oh, we fertilized. Yeah, do you have sample? I don't have it. So you can't... And that's also one of the questions of reviewers. Why did you do it in a greenhouse? Yeah, I can't say I can't work in the field because they don't allow me. It's not like Europe. I remember we measured some trace gases in Chiapas, in Su-Chiapas. And we left our PVC tubes in the field. They stole them. And we were communicating constantly with local people. I... Yeah. It's one of the reasons also why I think field experiments are similar, brilliant. And that we do some lab experiments. But it's very difficult to justify to review says, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for your talk. Just a comment. We actually also have a field trial that's been going on for 20 years in San Luis Potosi. Uh-huh. At the INIFAP station. So it might be interesting also to do some investigation there. They also evaluate conservation agriculture, minimal tillage, and conventional system. And two replications. Okay. Okay. What kind of soil is it? Sorry. If we can extract the RNA, then that can't be immediately. Because it's rather... No, no. Sorry. No, no. I will. No, no. It's not even... No, sorry. It's not even to do with the type of soil. It is at random. We had in the beginning, for instance, in El Batan, we sampled or... You're trying to extract DNA. You've got nine replicates, or you've got treatments. And all of a sudden, one soil, you can't extract it. Whatever you do... Now, we optimize that and blah, blah, blah. But it's... You... If you go to conferences or congresses, there was one at Brotswijk last year in December, where... And then you're here to see the same questions. DNA not a problem. RNA proteins that people... Huge amount of protein... Huge amount of money dedicated to extract proteins. Because that's the final solution. I mean, DNA, RNA, and proteins. But it's... And they've got money. You know, Europe, it's one million euros. But... You know what I mean? It's... These techniques are not yet what they should be. But I think they're brilliant. I love it. Thanks, Simon, for your comment. And I actually think that several... That several of the platforms that took some time to get them ready, slowly, are going to be... Ready to be put in... In these kind of... These kind of networks. And taking advantage also of thinking all the PhD students that actually have been connected to the work. And that... I think that's something we have to reactivate also in the team to see how can we... Maybe a PhD student working on San Luis Potosi or... So definitely Nele is working on that. Ivan is working on attracting more students. So I think that's how we can keep this kind of work going. Any more questions? Question over there. Somebody else? No? Somebody online? Sorry. Somebody online has a question? Now that I was recently following a seminar online, I know how frustrated it is you want to say something and nobody... Remembers that you're actually hanging on your computer. No? One time? Two times? Last time? No question? Luke, you had a question. The last... If you have a specific question in your... I'm more than willing to investigate it. But the descriptive, I think, no, because we've done it. I think we should start using these techniques to really, I have a problem here. Can I answer with my molecular biology? I think so. So if you have a question, more than willing. Yup. Okay. Thank you very much. Luke. I think this is a clear example of research for impact through partnerships. When I'm asked what is the value of the long-term trials, I just show Luke's first slide with... I don't even remember...
