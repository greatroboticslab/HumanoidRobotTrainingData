 okay look at this nice and neat organized farm you guys isn't this awesome i love it fantastic welcome back everybody to farming simulator 22 i'm an old guy gaming and we are coming back starting this episode with an end of the month update for july uh this has been an incredibly busy month um with working contracts and um we've made quite a bit of money but we also had to borrow some more money to get everything done so we're gonna have to get that squared away i just finished turning in the rest of the silage bales to finish up the hay contract so everything that's on my trailer and that you see in the field is what's left over for the silage uh we did a bunch of harvesting contracts uh we did some canola and a bunch of wheat and oats and as a result of that i got about 100 straw bales so we got a massive amount of straw bales uh doing all that and um we got a total of about six hay bales of the large hay bales from the hay contracts that wanted hay instead of silage and let's see what else we did a bunch of cultivating contracts so made quite a bit of money on that with our new cultivator which is great and trying to think if there's anything else in particular to talk about uh as far as you know the contracts go so i i did have that same weird issue where if um i i you know i worked i did this for many hours yesterday in real life and i finally had to quit and i had to go eat dinner and go to bed because it was getting so late and so but i hadn't fully picked up the straw off of the wheat fields that i had harvested so when i logged back in the next day um the game had well what would happen is it would it would switch the swap the fields over to cultivated and not give me credit for the quests so i had to log back in three separate times and then quickly go into the quests and and then turn them in you know to get paid for them which i eventually was able to do but then it also made a bunch of the straw disappear that i had already you know was in the process of baling so i estimated how many bales that i you know would have otherwise gotten and and just gave those to myself with the admin tool um so yeah it came out to around 100 bales of straw which is huge i mean our our barn is it's not completely full but it's it's in good shape man we'll put it that way good shape so and let's see i don't think i did any other types of contracts there weren't any fertilizing or selling or anything like that in july and yeah that's but that's pretty much it i didn't bother saving the grain you just don't get that much of it it's more useful you know for saving for your chickens but we have so much barley now that i just went ahead and sold it even though this is the worst time of year to sell just about anything july is a terrible month for selling but otherwise you know we would have had to take the small amount that we got and store it in the train station and pay rental on that just to make like two thousand dollars when the price is good kind of thing it just wasn't worth it to me to do that i i would have kept it more for like i said the purposes of feeding the chickens but we don't we're in such good shape right now with that that it i just don't want to mess with it okay so anyway i think all of the silage from our fields are probably yeah those are ready too so i'm gonna have to get those loaded up i'll do that off camera though it's going to take a long time um so let's throw these bales in and then we'll go back to field 71 pick up the remaining bales and then turn that contract in and see where we end up with our money this is gonna you know we're probably gonna fill this silage storage thing back up again almost completely full by the end of the year and boy are we gonna make some cash man off of that i mean we we got six full stacks off of our hey uh our own fields that's just amazing um you know plus i'm getting about one and a half to two um ish for each um computer farmer hay cutting you know too it depends uh we don't get quite as much on the first hay cutting but we tend it tends to get better get better in terms of the yield as the year you know grows later i haven't actually confirmed that for sure but it kind of seems that way anyway okay yeah so let's go get the rest of these bales oh where am i going i need to go this way totally here yapping at you guys and not paying attention to where i'm going yeah we need to go this way oh i've i found a couple more um collectibles too i actually found one of them a long time ago and i keep forgetting to show you guys where it's at let's grab that real quick while i'm thinking about it if you don't want to know where these are then yeah don't watch the next five minutes or so of the video uh but anyway one of them i think was somewhere around in here and i i literally found this a long time ago and i just keep forgetting to show you guys where it's at um i think it's somewhere over here anyway uh maybe it's further down than this actually or it could be over here where am i getting all turned around here hmm was it further down this way it's been such a long time like i said i don't even remember exactly oh here we go yeah right here okay so let's get whoops all right i'm having trouble getting to it here all right you found a cedar there are four more cedars to be found awesome okay and then i'll show you where the other one is so if any of you are averting your eyes keep averting them for just a little bit longer some people like to know where these things are and some don't you know if i was what if i was watching me do this and i didn't know where they were i wouldn't want to know where they were i'd want to find them myself so i would be averted my eyes right now if it was me uh anyway okay so let's go towards well here i'm not going to say anything just follow me we're gonna go this way and then we're gonna go that way then we're gonna go up the hill and down the hill and around the corner and under the bridge and over the bridge and yeah right okay here is the other one that i i just found this one like yesterday you found a water trailer there are four more water trailers to be found nice okay so that's two more collectibles that we can add to our our statistics i'm i haven't actively looked for these since that one episode that we did a long long time ago where i was actively looking for them i just you know i stumble across them and every once in a while and i figured oh there they are i'll wait and show show everybody on camera that wants to see it okay so we are back now at field 71 and we're going to pick up the rest of these bales so yeah we're not we're actually only going to get a trailer load and maybe a fourth this time but still i mean this is essentially free silage and we store it and wait until the price is at its max and then we make a whole crap ton of money off of it okay so that takes care of the contract bales like i said i will pick up these six stacks of bales off camera and get them in the stores before the next episode i'll do that later though um so let's go back to the yard and i did go ahead and purchase that lizard rake that that little front rake and man i'll tell you what it is so nice it just makes baling a breeze um really really enjoy enjoy that rake so i got the bigger one too rather than the smaller one and it seems to work a little bit better than the smaller one too okay let's just uh well here we might as well park this trailer and then we'll take a look at our money oh wait i gotta get i gotta get that stupid uh uh whatchamacallit tetter in there first it's not a stupid tetter it's a nice tetter okay you could definitely move something like this by hand in real life maybe not pick it up but you could easily push it or pull it so i'm just gonna do that right now okay i think that's in place whoops just barreled right into my trailer there knocked a couple teeth out okay okay that's good enough i know it's not all the way back in there but it'll have to do it'll have to do man okay so let's see where we are there's the rake right there that i bought i think it was like 25 000 or something like that let's look at that windrowers oh 32 000 32.5 in fact okay yep so we purchased that um all right now let's look at our money turn this off let's see what we're doing here so if we go oh yeah we need to turn this guy into there's another 25 000 right there i'm not going to do these harvesting contracts and as you can see there's um oh oh we just had a couple cultivating come back up you know i'll probably do those i mean they're so easy to do and i have you know i have my own equipment for it so yeah i'll do this but i'll do them later just just know that we're going to add another eighteen hundred dollars or so onto the top of everything else that's happening okay so let's look at the finances um so that 32.5 of course is from buying the the rake uh we spent eighteen thousand dollars in repairs because we're just using our stuff so much um i didn't borrow any of the farmers equipment for the hay i really should do that for the biggest fields it's it's worth doing um because you know they don't they don't deduct too much money off of that and i spend more money repairing my own equipment um if i use it so i really need to do that but sometimes i just forget to or whatever uh mysterious 45 for production costs there well actually you know what we're not actually at the end of july are we this is still july 1. oh right um okay well let's just let's just see where we're at so i sold just a small bit of bales from the contracts we spent that much in fuel 90 dollars um we made 14 718 dollars from harvest income from just the grain and canola that we sold and we made 164 000 431 or 341 uh from contract income which is really good that's what we grossed of course paid workers 15 000 this miscellaneous is what is that miscellaneous i don't know what that's from i can't i can't remember what this is for um and then i had to like i said i had to borrow a little bit more money early on because i was like flat broke and i needed to pay the workers so so first thing we got to do is pay the bank off so we owe the bank seventy thousand dollars um so let's do that now and i want to pay them off right now so i'm not paying interest for the next two days okay so that leaves us with the balance now of 53 thousand seven hundred ninety eight dollars okay so let's take a look at and remember um you know we purchased we really if you think about it we purchased that huge cultivator and that rake so if we had not have done that we would have another 70 or 80 thousand dollars on top of this um so that's really kind of the money that we actually you know have um okay so anyway let's go let's go to animals chickens are good cows are fine for now and let's look at the greenhouses so this one is now we we now have to switch this over oh no i guess i already did switch it over to manure okay so everything is switched over to manure all the greenhouses are almost completely chocked full with manure we're no longer using solid fertilizer and life is good uh we are gonna i am gonna have to replenish the seeds in here but we could probably get away with waiting until um august to do that so i'm gonna i'm gonna wait till august to do that all right let's see here um um what else do we want to look at oh yeah let's look at the what we currently have in storage so 16 000 um eggs 13 000 almost butter 5 000 almost cheese 160 almost 170 000 lettuce we'll say 40 000 tomatoes and 77 5 000 uh on the strawberry so looking good there plus all the hay that we have in storage in fact um this should show us that so yeah we have now remember this doesn't count what's sitting on the ground that i haven't put in the uh you know the the barn or the storage thing yet so in storage we have 590 000 liters of silage uh we have 471 000 and change liters of hay and 1.2 million of straw that's amazing uh what else this is yeah this is with the manure and the slurry and stuff so forth that we're building up all right you guys now i gotta show you something i i gotta show you something i'm tempted again i am seriously seriously tempted again look it at what's for sale a t9 new holland what's this over here oh that's just a forestry forwarder um a t9 new holland articulating axle if it was maxed out it would have almost 700 horsepower 692 um but in order for me to buy this now i would have to take a significant loan out to get it oh man it's just a beautiful beautiful tractor but again i can't really justify this at this point in time and here's why because i have the man man truck and the man truck can pretty much do all of the heavy work uh which is is essentially pulling that ginormous cultivator and so it's i just i can't justify getting this right now um even though i really really would like to do so look at that beautiful tractor man it's just amazing um but yeah i i can't i can't justify it can i afford it yeah i can in the long run but i just i don't know i would really like to but it's more of a want and not a need at this point i think i mean we will eventually we are eventually going to get a third tractor and preferably a big one um because you know the more tractors we have the more work that we can can get done but again you know this is really for almost almost all intents and purposes a third tractor and a 500 horse one at that which we've already talked about so i'm gonna let that one go as much as as much as it sucks i think it's the right move for us right here now i mean i was tempted i really was thinking i was thinking man how can i justify getting that tractor and i couldn't i just couldn't justify getting it so anyway uh but the good news is we are out of debt now um and we have 53 000 on top of that and um so we really need to get a shed going over here and i think that's what exactly what we're going to do um so let's um yeah why don't we why don't we get why don't we do that and then we'll get everything situated there's no reason not to do it right now that i can think of okay so i need to get all this stuff moved out of the way first so let me get that done then i'll bring you back we'll put a new shed in and then start you know to put our stuff away and get our farm a little a little more organized than what it currently is okay i'll see you guys in a bit all right guys we are back and i have all the stuff moved out of the way it's been a little bit of time trying to decide exactly what i wanted to do for storage and i think i have figured out figured that out so uh what we're going to do is we're going to go into the build menu and we're going to put up two of these easy sheds here i kind of wanted to do this one but it's so doggone big um there there's just no room for it over in this yard here i wanted to i was thinking about putting this one here but it's it isn't gonna work um the only place i really could put this if i did put it anywhere it was is maybe right over here i don't want to put it over here because i have plans you know future plans for productions in that area um so i could put it here maybe like right about in this general vicinity um because um you know we have this room here and i want to eventually kind of get a start getting away from the weird irregular fields because it's just a pain in the butt to um you know to harvest that sort of thing and have a you know all of our fields nice rectangles and squares and that sort of thing and so that that would open up this area here for us to put more buildings and stuff in the future um and that's what we're gonna do over here too so but i don't i don't like the idea of the shed being not in you know the main yard here first of all and secondly uh i don't know if now is the right time to to remove this hay because this is making us muddy right now so so i don't think we're going to do that i think what we're going to do is we're going to take this easy shed here and we're going to flip it around this way and we're going to just put it in this spot here so what i want to do is basically i just want to bump it right up against the existing shed then pull it out so it's not colliding and then go as far that way as we can go with it so i think right about there is what we want to do now let me turn this way i don't want it sticking out past this shed here either so we're basically looking at about right there i think because we can't go back any further this way so yeah let's do it okay it's done now the other thing i'd like to well actually hold on before we do that and we could hold it out a little bit here let's sell it real quick while we get the full money back okay let's try that again but i want it actually went right about there there okay now we're gonna we're gonna build another one of these and the other one i want over by the cow barn and we're gonna store our equipment that we use to take care of our animals uh in here all right and the spot we're gonna put this is gonna be right here um i have i mean hmm the other thing we could do is we could we could instead put this over here that would line it up with the cow barn i think would look better over here okay hold on i gotta have to think about something here for a second all right guys i'm back um it's like really getting dark too um but i think i figured out what i want to do so i'm gonna go ahead and put um this shed here and the reason the thing that i was trying to figure out just as an fyi was i'm planning on moving the chicken coop um this chicken coop over here and put it and potentially put a second chicken coop in later on down the road um and i wanted to make sure there was and i was planning on putting them in this area so i just wanted to make sure i was going to have room to do that and i think i will so uh what we're going to do is we're going to put this one here and i'm going to actually okay we can't go any further to the right there because of the manure thingy um and i can push it back this way but i wonder if that's going to cause a problem with the chickens uh so i think i'm going to pull it back out this way a little bit and let's put it right there okay it's a done deal yeah we're gonna have to do a little bit of landscaping action here um but my goodness you know what uh let's sleep and come back in the morning and finish this out because yeah it's it's just too dark so i will see you tomorrow morning okay so we have a nice bright sunny july 2nd morning and um i want to do something about this here but i have to be careful of you know our money whoops and uh yeah so basically yeah all this left is to do some landscaping to to kind of fix things up a little bit i just hope it doesn't cost us an arm and a leg to do it so first of all let's see if we can raise this up now the idea here with the crick is culverts we're just gonna have to assume we're putting culverts in as we you know cover up the the creek running through here um so i don't know i there are some there there's some mods that allow you to do bridges but i don't think there's any bridges in the in the base game as far as i know uh but what we're going to want to do here is we're going to want to raise up the ground and again i just have to watch my money because this can get really expensive so let's increase the size of our our thingy here and raise this up and like i said we'll just assume that we have a culvert running underneath the there for the water to flow okay then what i think we want to do is we want to level now with here yeah we kind of messed up the road a little bit there but not not too bad actually okay that doesn't look too bad right there let's um let's reduce the size of this and um i think i want to go to softening here and we're going to need to i want to fix this so let's go down another size just don't want that seam right there because it's not very realistic that's going to be a bit of a bump but i think we could live with it why don't we do this raise up a little more back this way too and then we'll smooth that down a little bit that's not too bad i mean yeah there's still a little tiny bit of a seam there there okay yeah that works for here that should work for here okay and then let's go over to this area and what we want to do here is um i want to raise this up a little more here so it's a little more gradual oh crap i just messed up my crops dang it um all right next time we do some plowing i'll have to fix that uh let's switch this over to the square and make it a little small i guess that's all the smaller it's going to go i think we want to go smoothie now anyway there's just going to be a little bit of a an angle getting up into there but that's okay i don't think that's a problem i kind of you know i i drive up here too so let's smooth this down a little more too so it's not quite so intense oops um all right i think that'll probably be okay and yeah we're gonna store our animal care equipment in here in the shed all right all right yeah i think that's fine uh you know what we could do here is we could at least add some meadow grass back until i can fix it later all right all right that's good enough so there's something there okay yeah i think that's good i think that's uh a good setup now again i would have held this back further but we need to make leave enough room for chickens uh for two chicken coops potentially um that will go this direction so we would put the first one probably right about here and then the second one would go right about here ish and there's still you know enough room to do that i guess i could have held that back a little further huh but i don't know i don't know if i did have enough money to put this in i don't know you know where it starts to consider it overlapping you know we could do just as an whoops i didn't mean to do that well yeah just as an experiment so we have 26 377 dollars i'm just going to add um a million dollars temporarily we're not going to actually spend this money okay and then let's go back over here for a second where are we at um here now if we go to animals and chickens and um so i would probably start it right there see yes it says it's over oh nope okay i think it's overlapping with this one okay yeah that'll work all right let's quickly sell these good okay that'll work just what the doctor ordered very cool okay now let's go back to here and remove a million dollars and that puts us back to 25 788 what didn't we have 26 something i don't know whatever boss doing experiments okay so i think we are in good shape so we got this all leveled out over here still have a bit of a bump here but it's actually not as bad as it was before we could actually you know we could here i'll tell you what i want to do this let's go back into here for a second and back to landscaping and sculpting i want to raise this up just a little bit more more because it's such a an abrupt angle make it a little more gradual coming into here all right and then let's just soften that okay now let's look at it yeah that's okay that's okay all right cool so now we have some more sheds to store stuff so i think the first thing we're going to do is let's hop into here and i want to kind of do this based upon frequency of use so we we generally only use the curtain cider one one time a year when we're selling all of our stuff this isn't a frequently used implement so that means i want to kind of put this way over off to the side here all right that's um it's pretty straight actually i think and it's all the way almost all the way back now i put i put my header trailer over here i don't i i don't even really use this actually i bought it you know because is there any secrets underneath here our collectibles uh we've been living here forever and i've never even looked uh anyway um i bought this for our header but i can generally just you know make my way to wherever i need to go with it so i'm almost wondering if we could just sell the thing uh how much would we get for it if we sold it um no we want to go here that's what's in the sales better trailer uh i'm not that much money really okay well what i'm going to do then is um you could definitely grab this in real life and pull it to where you needed it to go um so i'm gonna do that ish it's such a pain in the butt to try and drive oh well okay i don't know if that would happen in real life and i'm gonna put this on the other side of the curtain curtain side and this is where this will live unless i decide to sell it at some point i mean we're not gonna get that much money out of it might as well just keep it because you never know i might actually want it at some point let's move the tongue over to the side so that takes care of those things now what we frequently use is the water tank and even the flatbed trailer we use that quite a bit so what i'm gonna do with those is i'm gonna put them on the other end the the near ends because they're gonna be where they're a lot more accessible for us yeah i really like this trailer it is a nice piece of equipment um in fact it looks like it's probably going to be too long for the shed um maybe what we'll do is this then oh yep we're in the back okay yeah it does it does stick out a lot doesn't it it's just really long yeah let's just we're just gonna have to go with that for now that's you know partly why i wanted that longer shed but it's all right is what it is at least the majority of it's undercover now and you know as some of you or maybe all of you probably know you don't actually have to put these things undercover like you would in real life but you know it's just seems like the right thing to do you know what i mean so that's why we do it okay well let's see what's next uh we have the we have the we have the brantner and we have well we're gonna take we're definitely taking the silage extractor over to the other barn because that's for animal care so let's move that right now uh here's what actually here's what we're gonna do with the truck so we're going to hook up to the cultivator since we need the truck to run the cultivator or operate it and hopefully we can park both of these in the shed together and have enough room to to to get the truck all the way in it's gonna be i don't know it's gonna be close we'll see and we can put that right on the edge so it's easily accessible oh yeah we're good man we're good okay so okay so this is where we'll park the truck and the cultivator a whole lot of room left there huh it's for the most part undercover okay okay that's looking good okay and now what we're gonna do is let's let's move the combine over we don't uh use the combine real often but we do usually use it a couple times a year well does that get man the stupid camera so actually getting the header it's not really getting the header undercover though you know honestly i like the idea of moving the reefer over to this bay let's do it and put the combine all the way on the end now that actually leaves us a narrow spot there what could we potentially put in there something that we don't use very often i don't really use the wind drower in fact we might never ever use the wind drower again now that we have you know that fancy schmancy new rake so why don't we do this we do use the the tedder on occasion but this we just don't really need it in fact i wonder if we should well i don't want to sell it i want to have one just in case and again there's no way you could lift this in real life but you could probably pick it up and and drag it so we're just going to do it this way there we go okay and we'll pull it forward just a little bit too because like i said we do have to get to it every once in a while okay good i like that that's a pretty good setup there now we should be able to put the combine why am i wasting fuel what does the matter with me okay we should be able to put the combine in there now it's about as far back as we can go without hitting anything that doesn't count there we go all right i like it i like it i like it a lot looking good man looking good okay so um let's see this i haven't decided what to do with this rosselmosh cultivator the reason i'm hanging on to it is because i could put a second tractor on this to work if you know if we take a whole bunch of cultivator contracts what i might do though is i might pull this baler out of here and put it next to the other baler uh if it'll fit though it's a that thing's pretty big it's a pretty wide baler i don't yeah i could probably make them fit and then the rosselmosh these we only use on occasion these we only use on occasion and yes you could very easily pull that in real life um why don't we do this let's drag that back this way a little bit and we'll put put all these in the back like so okay you'd have to have a pretty pretty doggone strong back i think to pull that thing in real life i mean you could but yeah let's use the tractor on that one we're going to be somewhat realistic here okay so like i said i use these rollers all the time every time we harvest our own hay we use them plus you know we use them too when we create new fields so we want them to be easily accessible and so what we're going to do is i'm going to put both of them in this bay here okay that should be good for this let's go grab the other one and put it right next to it i think we'll just store the brantner out at the other barn well we might have to we might have to store the rake out there too i don't know we'll see and now this little bay here like i said will be the new parking spot for the mccormick we might be able to actually put the hay rake next to the field repair unit there we go yeah let's uh let's do that let's put the hay rake i think it'll fit it's kind of high all right yeah so this will be the new home for the rake we actually we could put even something in behind there i i've got the i don't really ever use the front loader anymore uh or these in fact we can sell those long forks i've never i used those once and they made everything really unstable it's this yeah we don't need this let's sell it it's a nice idea but it makes the pallets way too unstable so the front loader attachment and the forks we do want to keep that but i don't think we can i don't think we can fit that stuff under here um we can we could put the weights under there well actually can we put that under there let's just try and see what happens yeah that works oh very nice okay perfect perfecto honestly i'm not really too worried about those weights i'm just gonna leave them where they are they're painted so they get a little wet once in a while not a big deal all right let's see so i think we're gonna move the telehandler um over to the other barn and we still have a lot of room at that other barn too and we're gonna also put the brantner over there so let's let's take the brantner over there first i'm also gonna take the mixer and the straw chopper out of the barn and store them in here okay so we'll put that there let's go get the chopper in the mixer wagon and bring that over um very good okay so um we want to bring the telehandler over here and i might like i said i might move the baler into the next to the other one and then we can put the forklift back in the barn in its original place where we used to park a long time ago i don't really use the forklift very much anymore either but i don't want to get rid of it because it's a pretty useful implement to have okay i'm just going to drop this off here for the moment because we have to go pick up the other attachments and bring them over here too so so so so all right there's the telehandler's new home it's looking good man coming together uh let's see okay so the last two things i think that we want to do is i'm gonna i'll just leave that open we might close it in the winter keep the cows warm um figure out where we're gonna put the forklift and um what was the second thing i can't remember now there was two more things i wanted to do oh excuse me oh uh move the baler over to the other one this one's a little bit easier to get get to and you know we certainly could i could put the forklift down here see especially since we almost never use it anymore that makes sense in fact we could even put this down there too yeah i think we'll leave the rosselmosh just right where it is that that works okay let's get this guy yeah i do know we have we have the flatbed trailer there too but that thing i can't use the tongue lock thingamadoodle with it it's such a pain in the butt to back up that i think we're just going to keep that outside and don't worry too much about it okay that is now the new home for the forklift if i could get out that's a pretty good spot for it i think and now we're gonna put the baler over next to the other bader i mean this isn't a bad spot for the bader the problem though is that i have a hard time getting off the tractor to hook it up with the you know with the doors in the way like here here here it's not too bad but if i get it a little further in there then it can be a pain in the neck and we use both of our balers very frequently so it just kind of makes sense to put them in a really easily accessible spot that's tight but it works nice i could move the pottinger over just a smidge too but it's good the way it is all right guys i think that's it i think we have done a fantastic job if you don't mind my saying so of organizing our farm this looks much better now much much much better that trailer can stay right where it is i suppose what we could do is we could pull the farm tech in forward and then back this one in afterwards we wanted to yeah what the heck let's do it i was looking i could have i could have sworn that um well you know what we're gonna do too we're gonna back this in from the other end because it's gonna be easier at some point i was looking on mod hub and i found this elm street barn but with the working silo but i couldn't find it again i was looking all over for it and i couldn't find it so i don't know if i was imagining things or did we not hook up our lines oh that was weird okay but i couldn't find it so yeah i don't i'm not sure either i imagined it which is possible or the mod author took it off the mod hub for some reason um because i was i was planning on replacing this barn with that barn on the working silo but yeah anyway if if that doesn't work then i have i have another silo plan i want to eventually get my own silo i mean you just you know we're a farmer we gotta have our own silo right but the train station the train station works so well it's so cheap that it's just you know kind of made sense oh you know what i have to kind of lift this up to get it to now there is this silo that we're looking at that doesn't actually work there is an actual working version of it but the problem is if i put it in i'd have to put it next to that and then we're blocking our our roadway there so i don't think we'll do that i have two other possibilities when silo time comes um but yeah we'll just we'll just wait on that for now we don't have a lot of grain and stuff that we're storing at this point in time so it still just makes sense for us to stick with the train station for now ideally we want to get the tongue and everything inside or at least as close as possible uh how much space do we have like none okay that was like the absolute limit that i could put it in there without bumping into the other one but that works i like it that works okay look at this nice and neat organized farm you guys isn't this awesome i love it fantastic uh all right so let's uh let's park the new holland and we are finished with july turn that off um let's go to july 3rd before i let you go just so we can actually get to the end of the month okay welcome to july 3rd let's look and see what the sales have ooh this is basically the same thing that we have now except for it has its own built-in uh bail thingamadoodle but it isn't any more capacity and at this point that would just be a luxury that we don't really need that would be a very nice uh implement to have though but yeah for the price definitely can't afford that right now but it's tempting it is indeed tempting okay so let's look at um our ledger again oh you know what there i do have to do a couple more things wait a minute did i just take oh i finished those off camera but i never turn them in okay cool so that gives a little bit more money um we need to pay our worker for moving pallets and also because i don't have a square bale pickup i i use the auto load feature on the flatbed trailer to pick up the straw bales and the hay bales and i'm not doing that for free so i'm basically paying uh workers to help you with that even though in reality there's no way they can lift up those bales but we're just gonna not get too serious about that so we're gonna give them an additional 500 bucks 250 a piece for helping us with that so that means we need to take 3 700 out to pay the workers very good okay so now this is our money at the end of july we've already actually looked at this earlier in this episode um sold buildings oh did i put i must have put a couple of things down and then picked them back up really quick and i may have done some of that on camera some off camera because i was messing with some stuff oh yeah it was it was the chicken was it i don't remember anyway i think that's what that's from um we've looked at most of this stuff already so yeah that's um pause the screen if you want to if you want to study it but we've pretty much already gone through this it's just that we're two more days uh passed so we are now sitting on thirty thousand dollars of cold hard cash 237 um we have no uh debt so yeah we don't owe the bank anything for now until until i take out another load and we're in pretty good shape we are in really good shape greenhouses are good we are going to need to get some seed in the greenhouses i will probably do that in august and also uh i don't we yeah we won't harvest our our own hand until september and then we'll do the farmer uh the computer farmers in october their third day cutting so august might be a fairly slow month um and so because of that i probably will not bring you back until the end of august end of month update to start the next episode unless of course as always i have a reason to bring you back before then all right guys thanks for watching hope you enjoyed this
