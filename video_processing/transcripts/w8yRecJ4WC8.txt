 all right several people have asked me is it actually cheaper to raise your own eggs have your own chickens and that sort of thing so this is 10 years of running cost and let me kind of explain what you're seeing on your screen total fixed costs to date fixed costs is things like the cost of the chicken coop the cost of feeders and waterers the cost of the automatic door and that sort of thing so it's like hardware cost things that aren't feed or water consumables cost is the cost of feeding water over a 10-year period so we go back to the fixed cost the housing cost for my chickens over 10 years have cost me three thousand two hundred and twenty nine dollars and twenty seven cents then the chickens i have raised have a one thousand five hundred and thirty one dollars and eighty one cents and chicken feed now i kind of do it a little different today but when i first got chickens i bought the chickens those chickens cost me two hundred and eleven dollars and three cents that was meat chickens and egg laying hens now today the way i do it is i hatch chickens from eggs and it doesn't cost me anything so that initial cost was maybe the first two or three years i was raising chickens when i was buying the chickens from a store so the grand total of those three categories comes to four thousand five hundred and fifty dollars and five cents now the total eggs my chickens have laid in 10 years is four thousand seven hundred and eighty nine eggs but some of those got broken when they were laid or got cracked and the number that was undamaged was four thousand seven hundred and seventy seven so if we go down and we figure up the cost per one egg if you add in the cost of the chicken coop and all the hardware and consumables it's 95 cents per egg which would come out to eleven dollars and 43 cents per dozen but if you take out the fixed costs and only look at the food it comes at 32 cents per egg or three dollars and 85 cents per dozen so you can see that both of those numbers most of the time is not cheaper than buying them from the store but where you benefit from raising your own chickens is you know how they were raised you know what they ate and you know how they were cared for and that price is consistent over 10 years it doesn't really go up or down the feed price can go up slightly like during covid the cost of feed went up several dollars per bag but then it dropped back down to like normal levels again and you do have some fluctuations but this is the cost over 10 years and as you can see it's almost always cheaper to buy eggs from a store anyways hope you like this information as always god bless you god bless your families god bless your homesteads don't forget to hit the like and subscribe button so please subscribe to the liked the link so if you please while check on ecplame nic
