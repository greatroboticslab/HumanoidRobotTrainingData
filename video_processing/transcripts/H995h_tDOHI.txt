 There are many useful products you can find on the shelves of your local garden center, and a few products that most gardeners in Wyoming should avoid purchasing. One in particular is gypsum. Gypsum is made out of calcium sulfate and is advertised as a general soil conditioner. However, gypsum really serves one purpose, and that is to immediate sodic soils. And the only way to know that you have a sodic soil, which is high levels of exchangeable sodium, is to get a soil test. But don't use gypsum as a general soil conditioner. It has not been shown to adjust soil pH or to necessarily lighten clay soils unless they are sodic. Another product that many Wyoming gardeners should avoid using is lime. Lime is calcium carbonate. Most of our soils in Wyoming are already high in calcium and quite alkaline, meaning they have a high pH. And while many gardeners that move to Wyoming from other states are used to using lime, Wyoming soils typically do not benefit from the addition of lime. The best thing we can do to improve our soils in Wyoming is to add organic matter, either in the form of compost, mulch, or manure. I recommend that you work with your local Extension educator to get a soil test, to determine what nutrients your soil is lacking, and to develop a plan for managing the soil health in your garden.
