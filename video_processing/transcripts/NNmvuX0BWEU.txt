Science & Technology
 within the 40 minutes. So I'm Garren Butcher, I'm chairing this session just on the Lucerne. I have a timekeeper here somewhere I think. Oh there you go, jolly good. Can we have the nod at 10 to 2? Get your big stick out. Do what you have to do. Probably everyone here knows Derek anyway, he's an extremely well-known scientist based up at Lincoln, been there since 1996 and he's the go-to man when it comes to Lucerne and Subclover. We'll touch on Subclover but mostly talking about Lucerne. Who hasn't heard Derek speak before? No. A few more than I would have seen. Most of you should be doing the talk then. So anyway we'll get straight into it. We're going to have a 10-minute session at the end but are you happy to take clarifications all the way through? We have this little innovation here. If you've got a question put your hand up or throw this at you, you have to catch it. Speak into the black dot. Right? I won't throw it fast or hard. So I'll hand it over to Derek. You don't need that there do you? No. I think it's all yours. Thank you very much and thank you for coming. What I thought I'd do today is actually I'm going to talk about Lucerne but really what I'm going to talk about is how I got on to Lucerne and what the principles of it are and try and I know that the audience here is not a true Lucerne audience. Some of you are not actually in areas that would be conducive to Lucerne but the principles that we talk about hopefully are appropriate for all of the farming systems that we work with. I'm just going to work out if I've got a dot. Oh that's a tricky one isn't it? What I'm going to do is give you some information. So when I operate what I'm doing are called on-station experiments. So my postgraduate students they do good research that has great data integrity and farmers consider that of low currency and relevance. So generally the results that come out of a field experiment done at Lincoln or done at Massey, farmers are well that's interesting but it didn't happen on my farm. That's the tendency for that sort of thing. So what we're trying to do is well I actually have to do that and the students have to do that because we want good quality data. But when it becomes more relevant is when we get down here and we have some case studies. So case studies are often for farmers what happened in their region or a farmer they can relate to becomes of high relevance. So high currency and relevance here. But for me trying to publish in journals it's got low data integrity. So I can't actually talk to other scientists with those case studies because they're not considered to have really good controls. So what we're doing as scientists is trying to operate from up here way down to here to get things to happen. No personal opinion here has low currency and relevance and low data integrity. So you may think you know everything but actually unless it's got some science behind it it probably isn't that good. And I'm not sure where we'd put Donald Trump on that particular diagram. Myths and legends maybe over here? I don't know. In his own mind. So what I'm going to try and do is give you a little bit of data to say look this is what I base things on. But then try and give you a few case studies of people that have implemented some of the things we've talked about and some of the results that they've got from doing so. This is me. You can spot me here as a Callow youth look. And I did wear shorts and I don't show my students that but that's pretty much how many of my students look at the moment. So I finished. I did some farming at Belclutha for part of my prac work. And I finished and I went overseas and I was given a book when I left. It was called The Village Pub. So we visited 87 village pubs in England my wife and I. It was fantastic. Got us off the main roads. But what I was doing there was actually working on climate change. And that was 22 many years ago. 22, 23 years ago. And at that time people were just starting to measure carbon dioxide levels and start to think about whether climate change was going to occur. And as a young industrial industrial industrial industrial industrial industrial industrial industrial industry, I said, well I've not really heard much about this. So I did some investigation and thought, yeah, actually I think this is real. I was working out whether we could grow wheat in Spain or not anymore. What was going to happen in 25 years. So that was what I was doing my research on. And then I came home and I was given a brief. One of the nice things about a university is you get given a brief. We don't care what you do research on, just do something. Very nice brief to be given. And that's what it was. And I said, well, if I put climate change with farming, actually in New Zealand the predicted biggest impact is on the east coast of New Zealand. It's from central Otago through to Hawke's Bay. That's where climate change is supposed to have the biggest impact. And more importantly, actually they're already coping with the greatest variability of climate of anywhere in New Zealand anyway. They cope with years of rainfall, no rainfall, cold, wet, the whole lot. So I didn't really talk about climate change for 20 years and some people, I still don't talk about it with them, but I talk about trying to cope with the variability that occurs from farming on the east coast of New Zealand. And so that's what I did. I said, well, let's work on that. The other thing was there was no one really working on anything but ryegrass and white clover when I came home 25 years ago. So I thought, well, I'll do something different. Everything we do is actually on our dryland website. So if you're looking for information from my research team, it's basically at Lincoln University slash dryland. And I'll put this presentation there as well. And it'll just have today's date and gore on it. So you'll be able to have a look at that if you want to as well. The first experiment I ever did, those of you that heard me speak before will recognise this. It was very simple. We got a coxfoot pasture and we said, well, what actually makes plants grow? Here's our normal coxfoot. Let's add all the water we can to it. So we've just bought $10,000 worth of centre pivot irrigator. Or let's add all the nitrogen we can to it here. Or let's add irrigation and nitrogen here. And so that's what we did. And we looked, there was a nine year old one on a coxfoot stand. So it didn't have a lot of legume in it and it was pretty grass dominant. But the results actually have transferred when we'd gone and worked on bromes and rye grasses and tall fescue. The same thing happened. That's pretty much what the average growth rate for the dryland pasture was. It was about six and a half tonnes of dry matter that we got. When we just added water, we took that to 10 tonnes. Now if you've just spent a lot of money converting to a dairy farm, that's not a great change in the amount of yield that you get. What interested me was that one. When we gave those pastures all the nitrogen they needed, we went from six and a half tonnes to 16 tonnes. So that highlighted how nitrogen deficient those pastures were. The consequence of that line is that farmers recognised that water wasn't their main limitation in Canterbury. Now remember, this is Canterbury 20 years ago. All those dryland farms being converted into centre pivot irrigators, actually the main limitation wasn't water, it was nitrogen. And so to produce 22 tonnes of dry matter, that's what they actually do, is they add nitrogen and water to get 22 tonnes of dry matter. That's pretty much what's happened. If we look at this graph, and you look at the blue line at the top, this line here has all the water it wanted and all the nitrogen it wanted. So the only thing that's causing it to go up and down is temperature. And if I account for temperature, I can do that. I simply account for temperature and instead of saying that today is Thursday, I accumulate how much temperature we get today. And if I do that, I can get my 22 tonnes of dry matter and say that that pasture grew 7 kilograms of dry matter per hectare per temperature unit that it accumulated. Okay, so that's the 22 tonnes and I've got rid of the Wiggly line. And this one here is the irrigated one that had no nitrogen. So it's produced 3.5 kilos of dry matter. So that's the nitrogen gap. That's what was missing in those pastures. That was the potential yield gap that we have in those dry land pastures. So what's happened to nitrogen applied in New Zealand? Well, that's what's happened to nitrogen applied in New Zealand because people started doing this around here and recognised that if I put water on, I'm not really getting much of a response. So we have increased our footprint nitrogen used quite dramatically in recent times. With that, nitrogen production is a very inefficient process. So we produce a huge amount of carbon dioxide. It's an energy intensive process. But I'm not bagging nitrogen because without it, we wouldn't have 7.5 billion people on the planet. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, doesn't matter. Until the 1950s, there were about 2 billion people on the planet. After that, with nitrogen fertiliser, it's allowed the population to increase exponentially. Prior to that, the Haber-Bosch process which produces the nitrogen, if you looked at farming in the 1920s, it wouldn't have been much different from the 1820s or the 1720s. It's really the advent of nitrogen that allowed us to grow wheat crops, it allowed us to industrialise rice production, that has allowed the growth of what people now call industrial agriculture. So that's what happens. And that's the urea use in Canterbury. Since about 2002, it's gone up on average 8,500 tonnes per year, every year. Now, you can shake your head when you look at that, but if you look at the previous graph, you can understand why that's happened. Because they put water on and nothing grew. Because actually, what was limiting their production, and what limits their production all the time, and what limits every plant's production is nitrogen. If I haven't got nitrogen, I don't grow. So what we now have is the difficulty of, we've still got yellow nitrogen deficient pastures all over Canterbury, and 1,000 kilos of N deposited from a urine patch causing us environmental problems. So there's a real dilemma on how we deal with this issue. But actually, we've still got N deficient pastures, and if you drive around Southland in the spring, and you see those urine patches, that's the yield potential that you're missing. That's the gap that's occurring. One of the other things that happens as we add nitrogen fertiliser, is we stop nitrogen fixation. So this is lucerne and white clover, and what happened to them as we increased nitrogen fertiliser application. This is the percentage of their nitrogen that they derived free from the atmosphere. How much did they fix with nitrogen fixation? So all of it when they've got no fertiliser, and then it decreases down as we increase the fertiliser rate. So if we put a lot of nitrogen on, we suppress the nitrogen fixation, we also give the advantage to the grass, and we end up with very grass-dominant pastures. Natural state of affairs. And now the dairy industry in Canterbury, a lot of the time it is when the cows leave the paddock, they call their air truck in. And I don't have any issue with that, because that actually makes sense biologically. But what I was trying to get at was this one. Do I really want to be doing that, or can I get the dryland farmers to get somewhere between the 6.5 they've got now, and the 16 that's possible by having nitrogen in the system? And the way to do that, if we look at that from a summer perspective, I'll just go back to that graph there, you can see in both of these cases we've got a dry period through the summer. If I account for that summer, by looking at the moisture response, what you find is, here's my 7 kilos of dry matter per hectare per day, and my 22 tonnes of dry matter. In the spring, if I've got water and I have nitrogen in the system, that pasture that grew 15 tonnes of dry matter is growing as fast as the one, because it's exactly the same. It's got nitrogen and it's got water. And then it runs out of water. Now plants are not that clever. I don't know if anybody has spoken to them recently, but they don't really talk back that well. They don't know they're running out of water. So what they do is grow as fast as they possibly can, and then bang, they run out of water. And that's why you've got a flat line there. So we ran out of water. And then the slope of this is pretty much the same as the slope of this. So here's, I can't do much about it, but there's huge potential for me to grow, feed in spring when I've got water, and in autumn when I've got water, if I have nitrogen in the system. Because nitrogen is used at the same rate, whether the pasture has nitrogen or not. So this shows you what a bucket of water looks like. Here's my bucket of water and it's full. This is basically your soil profile on your farm when you've got fuel capacity. So it's wet. And then we use the water as we go through the summer period and then we get dry and we've got a little bit of rainfall happening so we come up a bit, a bit more rainfall, and then at the end of the season hopefully we've filled the bucket again. That's a dry land, rain fed sort of system. But both the dry land plus nitrogen and the dry land without nitrogen pastures use that bucket of water at about the same rate. Because the use of water is driven by physics. It's driven by the humidity, the wind speed, and the temperature. And you know the use of water because you've heard that today we're going to lose 5mm of evapotranspiration. All that's saying is how much water are we losing from the system? We're losing 5mm of water. And every day we lose some water. Not 5mm if you've got nitrogen and 2mm if you haven't. It's 5mm. That's what evapotranspiration is on any given day. Driven by temperature, wind speed, and humidity. And that's what's going to happen. So that pretty much says I can use lots of water efficiently, the same bucket of water efficiently or not, depending on whether I have N in the system. So what that means is this patch here and this patch here are using the water at the same rate. Is that clear? So my philosophy was well if I know that, can I get dry land pastures to be more efficient than what they currently are? Because we know we have a limited water supply, we know nitrogen makes plants grow, we know we've got to meet animal demand particularly during lactation, and we know that we can grow more feed in spring if we have some nitrogen in the system. We want to minimise impact on air and water, be productive and profitable, and socially acceptable. And my answer was well I think we can do that with legumes. And it wasn't that new because when I was a student that was what I was taught. It sort of changed a bit but how do we make the system actually operate? So when I started working there was, I'd been taught about Lucerne when I was a student at Lincoln by Professor Langer, the late Professor Langer who died last year. But I'd been taught about Lucerne, I came back to New Zealand and no one was talking about it. So can we use legumes? So legumes fix about 25 to 30 kilos of nitrogen per tonne of legume that you grow. And that doesn't matter if it's beans, or it's peas, or it's gorse, or it's white clover, or it's lucerne, or sub clover, about 25 to 30 kilos of nitrogen fixed for nothing from the atmosphere for every tonne of legume that you grow. That's what you get put into your system. And we also know that high feeding value pastures look like that. They're leafy, there's not a lot of dead material, there's a lot of dicot, a lot of legume in there and a little bit of grass. So that's what we're looking for. And we also know that if we want to grow animals fast, and I had to grow them fast, 300 grams per head per day or more, then I have to actually have an ME of 12. And the only pastures that do that are mostly clover pastures, good quality lucerne, rape pasture, or better than that, mother's milk. If I get the national average of around 150 odd grams per head per day, really what I'm dealing with is average ryegrass growing pasture of an ME of about 10. Now for my dryland systems, I've got a graph later, but for a lot of the people I work with, they had to get a lamb from birth to slaughter in 100 days. Because they've only got three months of growth. September, October, November, or October, November, December. And then it's dry. So they either sell stores and get hit by a store market, or they've got to grow animals quicker. So if you think about that, if I have a five kilo birth weight and I want to get to 35 kilo live weight to finish, I've got to put on 300 grams per head per day over 100 days. That's just the numbers, that's just what it says. And to do that, I therefore need high quality pastures. And we also know that animals like to eat legumes. Given a choice, they'll eat 70% legume, 30% grass. So when we put them in a paddock and there's not very much legume, that's what they go and eat. So we constantly put pressure on the legume, put them on a hillblock, constantly it's the legume that gets eaten. So over time a hillblock starts to deteriorate in terms of their production. Because the thing they'll eat when they target, and particularly ewes, they will target the high protein, they'll target that legume. So I asked around why people weren't using lucerne at that time, and got a few answers. And so what I've got here is a pre-see of some of the results of the research that we've done in getting the lucerne system operating. Now I don't care whether it's red clover and plantain, or it's sub clover, or it's white clover, or what it is that might work in your farm system, the principles are pretty much the same. It's a legume that will drive production, it's a legume that the ewe requires just pre-lamming and as they're lambing, because that's when the greatest demand is coming on. And any animal that's losing weight during that time is an animal that's harder to put weight back on. Put more feed back into them before you take them through to tupping the following year. So high quality feed is very important through that early lactation period. From an establishment perspective, lucerne does best on free draining soils with the same sort of pH and fertility as ryegrass white clover. We sow about 10 kilos per hectare, and we use peat inoculated seed, particularly if you're putting in a lucerne stand into an area that hasn't had one before. Then you need the inoculant. For a lot of our legumes, red clover, white clover, there's actually the bacteria that will fix nitrogen floating in the atmosphere here now. And if you sow them into the ground, they'll actually grow pretty well. We generally spring sow, occasionally we autumn sow, and we generally cultivate or direct drill. Now lucerne can be successfully direct drilled. If you are direct drilling anything, if it's swedes or it's lucerne, whatever it is, you should be thinking about using something like diamonium plume. You can use phosphate. One of the things that direct drilling does is it doesn't mineralise nitrogen to give those plants a kick off, because you're not actually turning the soil over. So a little bit of phosphorus is very important when you're establishing a swede crop, for example, particularly if you're direct drilling. It becomes really important. The worse the root system, the more important the phosphorus becomes. Phosphorus is the energy source for plants. Because what we're trying to do with a lucerne stand is grow a decent taproot. And this one is one and a half metres long after eight months. So it's growing about a centimetre a day. That one actually came out of Pleasant Point. It was sent to me by a farmer when they had a flood there a few years ago, and it washed away a part of his paddock, and he sent me through a picture of his plant. In central Otago, those of you who have driven through there, you'll see there's quite a big change in that. So one of the key things we've done there is autumn spraying. Really important. If you've got a wet autumn and you've got brown top dominant pastures, or you've got California thistles you're trying to kill, that's the time to do it. The autumn is the critical time, because the plants are taking sugar down from the top to the roots. So that's an autumn thing that really happens every year, and pretty much, we've got some willow trees over there. That's what deciduous trees do. They take the nitrogen out of the leaves, and they store it in the trunk, or they store it in the roots. And they store nitrogen because they can't make nitrogen. But it's the nitrogen that makes the leaf green that allows photosynthesis to happen. So our deciduous trees actually take that nitrogen out of the leaves, they turn lovely yellow and red and all sorts of colours, but it's the nitrogen they're storing and waiting for next year. So does the brown top. So does the Californian thistle. If you want to control Cali thistles, top them in the spring, weed wipe them in the autumn with a translocatable herbicide. That's when they'll be taking sugars down. So the key thing here, this is low rainfall obviously, is to conserve moisture and kill the root mass. Second spraying in the spring, these are really dead. And this is just direct drill. So that's an autumn spray that's then been second sprayed in the spring, again with some insecticide and then drilled. And the drilling here, is the lucerne's been direct drilled in here, seed plus fertiliser. And that fertiliser is the phosphorus. Phosphorus is what's keeping you warm at the moment. It's the energy source for all of us. And for plants, it's the energy source for them to do photosynthesis, and it's the energy source for them to do nitrogen fixation. So plants actually need phosphorus. That's why we do super phosphate. But here we're just talking about banding it below the plant and giving that plant a good kick off when it gets going. One of the other issues that comes up is people get concerned about carbon, soil carbon. Everyone wants soil carbon. I don't want soil carbon. This is organic matter. This is a thatch sitting on top of soil. I don't mind the soil carbon down here. But this carbon here actually stops nutrient cycling. So one of the problems when you get a thick thatch of brown top or a build up of material on the top of your pasture is, it's difficult to establish in here. You've got to get rid of that. I can't put a seed in here and expect it to grow. But that's often the thatch we have when we're breaking in new land. So we've got to get rid of that thatch. And we might use a rye corn crop or something like that to be able to do that. That's one of the reasons that these cereal crops work so well when we're breaking in thatchy land. Is that we put a seed, and what we're doing in that case, is we can put a rye corn seed at depth through this. I can't put a clover seed in here and I can't put it down here because it's too deep. It won't come up. But a big cereal will go in there and it'll then come up. So the cereal crop in that case is being used to break down that organic matter. And often farmers that put in their rye corn crop or their oak crop or whatever it might be, find that the first year crop isn't very good. And the reason it's not very good is because they're generally putting nitrogen on to grow this crop, but the nitrogen is being used by the microbes to break down this carbon. Because you've got to have nitrogen in the system to get the breakdown of that carbon. So we lose some of that nitrogen. But then if we break feed this through the winter we return some urine, and then that urine helps and the second year crop is generally much better. So in a dry situation that's the way we've predominantly been breaking in that sort of land. From establishment, in cultivated areas in Canterbury we'll sow in about October and we'll get our first crop in December, and we graze it if it's weedy, and then we start rotational grazing. We don't need it to flower. If it does that's great, but we don't need lucerne to be flowering as we're rotationally grazing it. The key thing is to be patient. I'm not going to go through all the technical details of this. If you've got specific questions around this we can do it, but in 40 minutes I can't give you a how we do lucerne ABC. I just want to give you some principles. Some other principles. Growth is what we call kilograms of dry matter per hectare per day. So we need to understand that growth is about catching light. One thing to keep in your head is that light is instantaneous. If I don't catch the light today, it's not there tomorrow. The soil moisture is, I can conserve that for tomorrow, I can conserve the nutrients for tomorrow. But light is instantaneous. You either capture it or you lose it. Capturing light becomes really important because light is the driver of kilograms of dry matter per hectare. Most of you think kilograms of dry matter per hectare per day, what's my growth rate? Actually what you're talking about is how much photosynthesis happened today. How much carbon was made? How much sugar did we make? That's how much water is. To do that you've got to capture light. Development is when the plants flower. When do they produce leaves? Those things are driven by temperatures. They're driven by the same sorts of things and they're influenced by environmental signals. Plants can tell time and they tell it by the day length. How did the willow tree know to drop its leaves? Because the days were getting shorter. So that's how they're telling the time. So that's our energy capture device. Whenever I don't have a canopy of leaves, then I'm losing light from the system. One of the issues we have in spring is we have our pastures so short that actually we are losing light from the system. Because if they're completely short, they're not capturing all of the light that's available. So I just wanted to illustrate that. If I've got a metre squared, that area here, and I've got it completely covered in the ground, I have what's called a leaf area index of one. One unit of green leaf per, one metre of green leaf per metre of ground. To capture all of the available light, I actually need about three and a half metres of green leaf for every metre of ground. So I actually need the leaves to be up a little bit to be capturing and intercepting the light. Because there's generally more light available for us than the plants have the ability to capture. So we've got to capture all of that light. What we found with the lucerne was that if we irrigated the crop and we had a mean temperature of 12 in the spring, it's growing about 60 kilos of dry matter per hectare per day. But in the autumn, it's still irrigated, it's still capturing all of the light, but it's only growing 35 kilos of dry matter per hectare per day. So it's got nitrogen because it's a legume. So we set about trying to work out why do we get this big difference in growth rates between spring and autumn. So this was a PhD student's job at Lincoln and we had crops that we grazed, gave them 38 days resting and 4 days grazing, or crops that we grazed after 25 days and only gave them 3 days of resting. The experiment doesn't matter too much. What matters is what happened below ground. So this is the start of the spring and I've got about 3 tonnes of biomass below ground, because we don't often think about what's happening below ground. But below ground the lucerne stand, and I suspect the red clover and the chicory, have this mass of carbon and nitrogen stored. And then they use that and transport it up and therefore we get high growth rates. Hence we get those higher growth rates that I showed you in the spring. And then in the autumn, and for the plants there's only spring and autumn, plants only register when the days are getting longer and when the days are getting shorter. That's how they tell the time. And if they do that, then at the end of the season this crop had got back to its 3 tonnes of dry matter and looked pretty good. So it was doing very well. But the consequence of that, if I was only measuring above ground, was that this that's being put under the ground makes it look like it's got a lower growth rate. So the difference between these two lines is that really the mean is about here. This is from stuff coming from below ground up, Californian thistles exploding in the spring. This is from sugar being put under the ground into the rhizomes and into the roots going down. That's when I put my herbicide on the Cali thistles and get them because they're taking it down. So lucerne is doing that. Once we understood that, the same thing happening if we don't look after the lucerne stand, the same thing happened in the second treatment, but we killed that crop in two years because we never gave it a rest in the autumn. It needs a rest to get back to 3 tonnes to be perennial. So what that taught us was we can be much more flexible with grazing a lucerne stand than we ever thought we could be. So we now graze a lucerne stand. I have people that are grazing lucerne stands that are about 10 centimetres tall in the spring. They will start when the first paddock in their rotation is about that big. Now I used to be told when I was a student you wait for 10% flowering. Sometimes the crops were this, but who's heard that, 10% flowering? That's what I got told. And this set of data I've just shown you is my scientific explanation for no we don't. We can start when the lucerne is quite small. We can start rotational grazing on that or we can actually, we have some people who at a low stocking rate are actually set stocked on that because they've got so much lucerne on their property if they didn't have some animals on it during spring and when it's just starting to kick off they'd run out of room. So we can graze before flowers appear ideally with ewes and lambs. The growing point is at the top of the plant so once I remove that growing point, the growing point of a plant is the bit that produces the leaves. It's also the bit that tells the temperature. So the growing point is at the top. Now with the grass that growing point is below ground. So it pokes the leaves above ground and therefore I can set stock grasses. Because if I remove the leaf another one will pop up because the point, the growing point, the bit that produces the leaf is protected and it's below ground. With lucerne it's at the top of the plant so if I take it off it has to start and produce a whole new one from that crown of shoots that it's got. So that's why we rotationally graze lucerne and we can set stock grasses. So here we're looking at a stand pre-grazing. Now I've got that at 20 to 25 centimetres tall as being the first paddock that we're grazing in September. We've now shifted this down. We're actually at Lincoln grazing often the first week of September and we're on to 10 to 15 centimetres. So it then becomes a really viable option because we're using it early in the spring. This one looks like it's 10 to 15 centimetres because the photo's been taken on an angle. But that's what a grazing rotation looks like. So this is that first paddock. It's got about two tonnes of dry matter. Second paddock we go into. Third paddock, fourth paddock, fifth paddock, sixth paddock because we're rotationally grazing around the paddocks. That all looks pretty good and I've come back here and I've got paddock one, two and three at about three ton, about 30 centimetres which is perfect for going back in for the second rotation. Perfect height to be going in, 25, 30 centimetres, 30 centimetres tall. But look, these ones here got away on me. So they'd be paddocks that I probably should be dropping out of the rotation and cutting and carrying. In an experimental situation it's very difficult to do that but if I'd shifted this set of lines down a bit, which is what we're doing now, then actually all of these come down a bit and I no longer have to drop those out. So I'm maximising the feed that's actually going into the animals. So we're starting grazing at about 10 centimetres tall in the spring. And that's about 12 ewes plus twins per hectare is what we're starting on at about that point. So if I've got a 20 hectare block of lucerne and maybe I've got it split into five paddocks, that's 20 times 12 ewes plus twins per hectare, so it's 240 in a mob. Does that make sense? So if I fully slay partial across a few, which means that the bones have to drop the adjust it in at about 20 and getting up between 15 кто, in and having an a bli had to drop the<|ko|> other half the time. I appreciate that. So there are two gepisease Rans going to update your meals they're doing, we're going to open your of this game to reduce that, The first time is to start grazing. The first time is to start grazing. It would have been absolutely no problem at all time to start grazing, 22nd of August. That's a month earlier than we were starting when we first started doing this research. I'd be quite comfortable coming into this Lucerne stand now, 22nd of August. That's for me at Lincoln. But it's a month earlier than we ever were previously. Then it grows, it continues to grow and we grew some stuff that's 60 centimetres tall and you can't see a flower anywhere near it. It's this big and there's no flowers. If I'm waiting for 10% flowering, what a waste. So the key message is let's get onto the Lucerne in the spring and look after it in the autumn. Triplets happily grazing some Lucerne grass here. And priority stock lamb, beef, deer we've got dairy cows grazing Lucerne now. Once they're on it they should stay on it and we want to stay on a rotation with that mob of animals. If you haven't got Lucerne and you'd like to have it, about 20 hectares is a good amount to start with because it'll take your Hoggett mob for example. Five hectares becomes a nuisance. Five hectares cut and carry. But if you're just starting, 20 hectares is probably what you want to do and that'll give you the opportunity of having five, four hectare paddocks and being able to work some of this out and see whether it's going to work on your property. High numbers for short periods of time. No more than seven to ten days on any individual paddock and then they're off. These bulls are quite happily grazing with the ewes and lambs in early spring in Marlborough. A bit of fibres out there for them to eat and some salts available to them. Lucerne stores salt or sodium in its roots. So it needs sodium to be available. So it's just a normal salt lick that gets put out whenever you're grazing lucerne. It needs some sodium out there. One of the things that Doug Avery started to do for those of you who don't know Doug Farms in Marlborough is pre-grazed mow when the lucerne's really lush in the spring. I have no scientific evidence to say if this is good or bad but it seems to work. So instead of oops, I'm going backwards. Go back, go back. It's not wanting to go back for me. Here we go. Instead of having to put the fibre out, if you've mown some strips, the animals will actually come in here and eat this. So that's the fibre. And because whatever we put out as hay is not going to be as high quality as the stuff in the paddock, the animals will tend to not eat the hay. You can't get every animal to eat hay because it's not quite as good a quality and they'll always try and choose the highest quality feed. But if you have some strips like this, then this is actually just wilted for about 48 hours before the animals have gone in. And that deals with that lush lucerne that can be a problem in the very early spring. And you can see the bulls are in here eating the lucerne at the same time. In the autumn, because we know it's putting stuff under the ground, we look after the plant. So what I'm trying to say is I think lucerne fits the breeding systems really well. We've got a lot of animals coming in the spring, it's producing a whole lot of carbohydrate coming up, producing more feed than it should based on how much light it's intercepted. But in the autumn, we've got to recognise it's going to slow down. And so in the autumn, we've got to give it a chance to build up those root reserves. And that means trying to let it have a flower or an extended period. And autumn is any time between the second week of January and the end of May. That gives you a pretty big window to get it right. And go here. The stand needs a rest. And that way we can keep stands around for a while. In terms of quality, the ME of the leaf is always above 12. The ME of the stem is always about 8. The reason we're trying to graze at about 30 centimetres is because that's about 3 tonnes of biomass. If I graze 5 tonnes, I've got 2.5 tonnes of leaf and 2.5 tonnes of stem. If I graze 2 tonnes, I've got 2 tonnes of leaf and no stem. It's all highly palatable. There's about 2.5 tonnes of good stuff in a lucerne stand, which is about 25, 30 centimetres tall. Now if I'm making hay, I probably have to do 40 centimetres because I need that bit of stem at the bottom to have hardened off so I can actually cut it. And so that's why you tend to find hay crops are taller. But from a grazing perspective, actually that's where we want to be. And I don't know what that is. It's just that my hands go there. So it's that. That's what we want to go into a paddock and eat. About that. Now if it's weaned lambs, probably about that. But that's about where we want to come into a lucerne stand to maximise the quality that we're eating. We can have animal health issues, so our vaccination programme has to be good. And I'm not an animal scientist, but people tell me a 7 in 1 is the best option for a lucerne situation. B12 injections for if you've got a cobalt deficiency. And we don't flush on lucerne if we can avoid it in dull or wet weather. Because these little spots here, they cause a compound in the lucerne to rise. And when it rises up, it's called chemistrol. It actually suppresses ovulation rate. So you don't get as many twins as you'd expect. And we may find that we get that this year because there was a lot of wet autumn. And if farmers use their lucerne, then they may find their scanning and lambing percentages are down a bit. But this is some recent PhD work. What we found was if you're in that situation, you can leave them on the lucerne until two weeks before the ram goes out. So they can be going through the summer, putting on weight, doing really well. And then two weeks before you want to put the ram out, they should be off the lucerne. And then you won't have a conception problem. Once they're pregnant, they can go back on lucerne, no problem at all. It doesn't cause abortion. There's no issues with that. It's just that leaf disease from fungal causes it some problems. Red gut, the fibre, that mowing helps in that situation. Bloat, we know about. It can always be an issue. I'm not going to say you won't get bloat. People do get bloat. And it's devastating when it happens. Sodium, we've talked about because we need... You might see sometimes animals go into a lucerne paddock in the third paddock in the rotation and they're just eating the fence line. It's often because they're eating the weeds because the weeds have got sodium in them. Because they haven't had access to sodium. So start when it's 15 to 20 centimetres tall. Quality's maximised at 30 centimetres. The leaf and the soft part are the high quality stuff. Don't worry about the residual that's in a paddock once you've grazed it. It's of no consequence to the plant. It looks messy. So if you don't like a messy looking stand you can go and trim it off but otherwise it's of no consequence. Drop out paddocks if it's getting away. What you should be doing in a lucerne grazing in the spring is I'm grazing paddock 4 in my 6 paddock rotation. What does paddock 1 look like? I'm grazing paddock 5. What does paddock 1 look like? Because I want to enter paddock 1 the second time when it's about 30 centimetres tall. So that's how you should be looking at your stand. There's no defined number of days grazing rotation. Nothing like that. It's when do I get back to about 30 centimetres. And for us at Lincoln sometimes that's been after 28 days. Sometimes it's been after 35. Four to five weeks has been what we've required when we started that short one to when we get back onto the first paddock again the second time round. We've talked about an extended period of autumn growth. And in some areas if you've got a wet autumn then use your grass for tupping not your lucerne. And weed control, the wetter it is then the weed control becomes really important. So that's sort of an overview of lucerne. And I'll take technical questions later if people have got them. I just wanted to give you an overall understanding of the plant. And then give you a little bit of case study stuff. So this is Doug Avery. Who's heard Doug speak? A number of you have heard Doug speak. He's retired, he's in town now. I'm going to visit him this weekend. My in-laws still live in Blenheim so I'm off to visit my in-laws and I'll go and see Doug but I'll see him in town and we'll have coffee instead of me driving out to the farm. But Fraser's still on the farm and I'll go and visit Fraser. This is their story. This is the graph that really turned Doug's mind was when I showed him this one and said you know what, because of that remobilisation plus the plant's never nitrogen deficient, in your limited bucket that you get there at Bon Avery and Marlborough in the spring you can do about 30 kilos of dry matter for every millimetre of water you've got in the soil. Whereas your grass is only doing about 13. So all of a sudden instead of producing 2.5 tonnes per hectare in spring, you're producing 6 tonnes per hectare in spring. Because you've dealt with that nitrogen deficiency that I talked about earlier by having the legume in the system. And he got that and he then started to understand that what he really was was a farmer of water and it's maximising the use of the water that becomes important. When we talk about 5 mils of evapotranspiration, what that means is you've actually lost 50 tonnes of water from a hectare. The process of photosynthesis is not about saving water, it's about getting carbon dioxide into the plant. To do that, it's got little holes that open and the water flies out. You can't change that, that's biology. But we can maximise the use of that water by having nitrogen efficient plants in the system particularly in spring. Hence my desire to have sub clover in because it's our earliest growing legume. That's 14th of August, so obviously lots of ewes and lambs around. One of the things that we find is that you get hogget mating as you put more weight because those ewe lambs here will get mum's milk, so they'll do 300 grams per head per day and then they'll get straight lucerne and it's much easier to get them up to 55 kilos by the time they come round. Then you're hogget mating. We know that as you put weight on hoggets you increase the percentage that you're going to get out of them. So the whole system starts to spiral up because you've got better grown ewe lambs right from that first period of growth when they're just born right through. They stay on the lucerne and they're looking pretty good by the time you come to mating. It's an example of them growing and just another example of – this is October and he's still cutting some strips in here because it's been raining. There's a 550 mil rainfall environment. On Doug's property he increased the land area between 2002 and 2012. He gave me the figures every year but I stopped in 2012 because about then he started to lease a lot of land and take another farm on etc. It became too complicated to try and do a true comparison between the systems. But over a decade when I first sort of met Doug, he went from 1,100 hectares to 1,800. His sheep numbers went up a bit, about 12%. But the key thing was the performance. So we've got a 28% lift in lambing. We're no longer selling stores at 13.3. We're selling 19 kilo lambs that are going off prime. So we've got a 43% increase here. In total lambs sold we've gone up almost 100%. Now I know we've got an increase in area of about a third to a half but we've gone up 100% in terms of lamb production. Out of pretty much the same flock. And the return obviously being quite high. And for those of you that are interested, he's written a fairly good story that you might want to have a look at called The Resilient Farmer. One of the key things he says about that is it wasn't plain sailing. And so I wanted to illustrate that. Whenever you have a farm system, your farm system or whatever you're operating on, you know that system. So you've maximised that system and it's operating as well as it possibly can. Because wherever your farm is, after say 5, 6, 10 years, you've got it as optimised as it can possibly be. So your ability to change it becomes limited. You already know where the animals should be on any given day or how much feed you're going to grow. You've optimised that farm pretty much. And so your system starts to plateau. And what we're talking about is how do we implement a new technology like lucerne grazing. Well generally what we find is things go backwards. And for Doug they went backwards quite quickly. But this is, you get a new car or whatever it is, you do something different, you start to play squash and you've never played before. There's a down period here where you go backwards a bit. And it's always going to happen because you're trying something new. But what you're wanting is, look if I keep on this path I'm going to stay here. So I go backwards a bit and then I've got potential to increase my output quite dramatically. That's what we talk about when we say transformational change. Incremental change is a little bit. Transformation is big output change. What agribusiness is, you know there's a problem here, and this is if you read Doug's book, that's sort of when I met him, when he was down here. And it took a bit to come out. And there's a risk of going backwards, oh this isn't going to work. So we have to minimise that, and hopefully that's what science agribusiness technology people are doing. That's their job, is to try and minimise that. But don't be scared if things don't work the first time you grow on a rape crop, or a plantain red clover crop, or whatever it might be that you try, you can't expect it to work as well as what you've been doing for 10 years. Because you don't know the nuances of that system. So you have to learn how to deal with that. And our job is to try and minimise this negative output, and the risk of reversion. From there, maybe the next thing is irrigation. And you can move to another, I'm not sure, most guys that switch from a dry down to an irrigation actually have a problem. It's not plain sailing to first start putting an irrigator on. There's a lot of things to learn. Keep an eye, keep a thought of that process as I show you the next case study. This is Bog Roy, 400 mil rainfall in central, in the Mackenzie, Odomitata, Gundy and Lisa Anderson. This is their property. What happened is they had heard Doug's story in about 2008, and they were driving back from somewhere, and Lisa was a FERT rep for Ravensdown, and she came into my office because she was an ex-student. She sat in my office and she was asking me some questions. I can't even remember what the questions were. But Gundy was sitting there sort of a bit bored, and he saw this handout that I'd had from a field day at Doug Avery's place. He grabbed that and he started reading it, and then he just took over the conversation. He said, I heard about this guy, and that was it. I didn't know Gundy at all, but he told me what he was trying to do. I said to him, well actually your farm system, your feed supply and animal demand don't match. You're trying to produce a whole lot of animals in the middle of January and February, but you don't have any feed. You're 400 mils of rainfall. Why aren't you grazing your lucerne? That was about it. That was about the end of the conversation. Evidently from there, from Lincoln through to O'Marrima, he then just talked to Lisa the whole way home about what they were going to do and how it was going to change. This is their story after 10 years. That was their old system. Set stock, constantly chasing grass, hill country going backwards because they're constantly up there looking for every blade of grass. 100 days supplementary feeding, peak demand and feed supply, completely misaligned. What we did was try and implement what I call landscape farming. We take the areas that are deeper soils and we put some lucerne in because that's where the water's going to run to. Why would I cultivate this? It's already hard and bony. I'll let the water run here and cultivate that area. The first time the ewes and lambs went on, they got a phone call from the neighbour. The ewes and lambs escaped into your lucerne paddock. In the high country it was traditionally cut and carried. Outside the box. Getting started, they had a little bit of lucerne but starting the grazing was the big issue. Working out which bits of our landscape can we put lucerne into and utilise lucerne in there. The best thing Gundy did was marry well because Lisa was quite happy to cut cages and get some idea of how much they're actually producing. She was a numbers person and her training had forced her to do that. They got good support also. Pete Anderson, I think, is with stock here and they recorded the numbers. In the last 12 months or so I've just been able to go back and look at their numbers over time. What they found was kilograms of lamb weaned equals the number of lambs you've got times their weaning weight. That's the key period we were looking for. How many kilos are you getting? That depends on your scanning percentage of lamb wastage and your lambing. This is the key thing that changed. They decreased the lamb wastage. Merinos are not very good mothers. Any of you that know anything about merinos? Because they're generally being starved. They give birth and say thank God the parasite's gone. They walk away. If they're fed well then they might not walk so far and they might actually go back and inquire as to what that thing was that they just dropped. Or maybe two. Look, now we've got two. The lambing percentage, lamb growth rate, etc. You can see the 2008 system producing about 90 tonnes of weaned lamb and then starting to get an increase from their grazing and then a bit more and then a bit more. Now no reversion, I'd like to say that's because they had some intervention from Good Agribusiness and myself so they didn't go backwards but that's what happened and you can see now the same property is essentially producing 150 tonnes of weaned lamb when it was producing 90. It's a 50% increase. They've done that on a 400mm rainfall environment and their ewes mated hasn't changed very much initially. So what you find is you don't have to change your stocking rate very much, you're just feeding animals better. How close are we? Very close. Alright. Okay. That's good because I am too. Putting the two together you can see those steps and stairs and that's their change. Their key take home message, they listened to advice and acted on it. That was the key thing. They didn't just hear the advice, they actually listened to the advice and acted on it. So the Lucerne story has worked pretty well. It's defined a lot of systems. People are making money out of it. The sheep milk, goat milk people, they're all wanting green chopped loose herb because they know it's the highest quality feed and if your product is milk out of sheep you need high quality feed to do that and rye grass can't. I'll flick through that one except to say that part we knew 5 to 35 kilos in 100 days. The other plant we've been interested in and we're working on more at the moment is subclover. So this is the 11th of September at Ashley Dean at Lincoln and what we're finding is we're able to produce animals that are growing 300 grams per head per day very early and within 100 days. Ashley Dean is essentially a gravel. For those of you that don't know it, it's a stone farm at Lincoln that they put some soil in. Pretty much what the dairy cows are on are most of the plains. There's not a lot of soil there but within a three month period we are averaging 300, that's about 330 there, grams per head per day. If you do that 300 grams per head per day the time to go from 25 to 35 kilo live weight is about a month. Whereas if you're only doing 100 grams per head per day it's three months. So you've got to have animals growing fast have to get 22 megajoules per day. If I've got 12 megajoules for my lucerne they need about 2 kilos of lucerne per day. That's what they need to eat to be able to do that and then they're gone in a month. From a sub-clover story if you're interested in sub-clover this is a Moabra property, Tempello, David and Joe Grigg and their stuff is online on the Beef and Lamb website. What they pretty much did was all through grazing management David learnt how to graze. He didn't even know he had sub-clover on the property when we visited. He didn't know it was there and he grazed it properly. He gets that sort of pasture in the spring and his values here saying he's gone from 60 to 76 tons of meat. All they did was put in stock water and fences so they could manage their sub-clover. No seed introduced in that. Sorry if there's any seed merchants here. But they just managed what they had and knew which legume was going to work in their environment. You can have clover and sometimes it can be too short. So I just wanted to finish. Sometimes high quality feed is not good enough by itself. There needs to be intake. This is too short. What you find, this is a sheep with an mA of 11.5 but a decent intake. So you can get decent intake here depending on what the herbage mass is. So you can't just have high quality feed. There's also got to be a decent amount of herbage. So my take home here is sometimes our pastures are too short and it's not the quality of pasture that's limiting our production. It's the intake. You've got to have both and that's why the lucerne works. That's why the sub-clovers work. And there I've done. I believe it is not, there's many an hour. I think we've got 10 minutes to the bank. That's just the way you're talking about. We've only got about five minutes for questions. Sorry. That's okay. You're going to be about four minutes. I'm around until the end of the day so people who've got questions are happy to answer them. How do we get this to go? It's going. Hello, hello. It is going. Thanks Graeme. We looked at our place because we're in the Waimea Valley and I see that it's got the greatest change in climate and so you're looking towards drier. Okay. And I thought great idea we plant lucerne. Then I looked around and there wasn't a paddock that didn't have field tiles in it that required some extra care with that. How bad is lucerne in field tiles? I'd put the lucerne in and find out. Very brave. I'll give you a ring. So what we know is that it'll find them and it'll probably block them. But the advantage you get out of it I suspect will be worth the hassle and I'd have a go. And I'd find the dryer of the paddocks obviously, north west facing if there's any slope at all, any contour, I'd go onto those contours first. But the benefits are so great that I would give it a go. That would be my advice. And if I get it wrong, well you've done a paddock and I'm sorry. But unless you do it, we're not going to know. How far, well no, what is your, the highest rainfall that you can suitably grow lucerne in? Grow lucerne in? Rainfall is a misnomer. It's when does it rain? Okay. So a lot of people think they've got 1200mm rainfall and go, well you should be dairy farming. But actually it all falls in June and July and August. Actually what matters is how much rainfall do you get in October, November, December, January and February. If you have six weeks, eight weeks of dry, then it's worth putting lucerne in. It's worth having a go with a deep tap-rooted legume that will give you some summer production. If you've only got three weeks of dry, well most years you'll get through that. So the amount of rainfall doesn't matter, it's when it falls that really matters. So it's easy to say 400mm in Odomatata, yeah absolutely you've got to do it. But I've got people at 1000mm of rainfall that are still doing lucerne because their bucket, they've got soil like this, it's already full. If they get another 200mm of rainfall in August and September, it's not actually helping. So it's when it falls that matters. One more question because I've got the knowledge from another here. If your water table is at 20 metres and your... 20 metres? Yeah. And your tap-root is going down a metre and you've got 10 weeks of dry, is it still beneficial? And you're farming on gravel. If you're farming on gravel, what else are you going to grow? And I've had situations of people that sell the gravel ringing me to try and kill their lucerne. Because at the end of the load going down to get the gravel, there were still lucerne roots at 6 metres. So it won't stop at a metre, it'll keep going down as long as there is moisture there. Now if the water table comes up, we don't know whether that will cut the lucerne. You know, if you've got a water table that goes up and down, but if it's just down there and you've got gravel, nothing else is going to grow on it. So in that situation I'd probably look at autumn sowing. But we can talk about that at morning tea because you're wanting to stop. And after morning tea because you're wanting to stop. And other people need to talk about it. I have to bring this session to a close. We've got people busting to get into the door. I'd just like you to thank Derek, please, in the normal sort of way. It always... It's quite remarkable you get the top flight speakers, they make reasonably complex sort of discussions, quite simple and easily understandable. And Derek's a real cracker at that. And just in addition to the round of applause, you can drink this on the aircraft on the way home. That's for you. And that's for you as well. And many thanks again, Derek. It's been a good... Thank you.
