 We are currently visiting the first vertical farm using aeroponic towers in Italy. Located in the province of Bergamo in the Lombardy region, this aeroponic farm was set up by our partners known as Easy Peasy where they have 50 aeroponic towers in a greenhouse with a total planting capacity of 3,800 plants. Besides the fact that they can save more than 95% water usage compared to conventional farming, they use their freshly harvested aeroponic crops to provide a true farm-to-table experience within their farmstay known as Casa Clelia. This is truly the embodiment of sustainable farming in Europe where they are setting the example of eco-friendly agricultural solutions in Italy.
