 Welcome back to the Daily Grind, everyone. I wanted to show you guys how amazing these cabbages look. And in fact, some of these napas are starting to kind of form that center, kind of dense area like they do. So pretty soon I'll have those, but these bok choys are looking really good. And the mini bok choys are definitely ready. I'm going to make a stew right now, so I've got to harvest a few. So I just put a knife down, cut off the stem, leave the roots in the ground just like so. Just get as much dirt off as possible. Look at that. What an amazing baby bok choys. These are really doing well. And then also in this bed I had, or have, some peas. But they haven't started forming any flowers yet on this one. Just use the plane over top. Once I can harvest all these, I'm going to replant these bok choys probably in the next couple days. I am going to harvest quite a few right now, and maybe tomorrow or the next day get some for a stir fry. So I'm pretty excited about this. This is one of my favorite times of year because these are some of my favorite veggies to grow. You can see how well they grow here. Well, thanks for watching everyone.
