 RJ Doyle, McLaren Industries. Today we're running a McLaren Skid Steer Mulcher on a John Deere 333P. Running a great machine with the McLaren Skid Steer Mulcher. Take a look at the performance here with all these palmettos. We got some big pines in here and it's just mulching them up. Just wanted to show you how fine the material is. You can see these wood chips after it's went over it. That's just one path that has shaved these trees up into mulch. So if you're looking for a Skid Steer Mulcher to go on your John Deere 333, give us a call at McLaren. Go McLaren, go extreme! That hasn't been Gospel. Go McLaren. Hey, Maggie. Thanks for now! I'm back! Yes! I like that, everything's big! Hey! My God! happened here, man! I'm coming back up! Yep! Virtue one! Hit! Police is going to pass up, syndrome! One day, tengoGM- ... ... ... ... Is it going to be better?
