 What's up guys? Hope you are doing good. This is live with Makori again. I'm in the village and this is the perfect example how busy people are in the village. You can see they are really working very very very hard. Guys, I want you to ask yourself this is really the life where you want to wake up to where you are being woken up by the sounds of birds, chickens, the mowing of cows and this strong wind from trees. So for me I would rather wake up to a beach and maybe enjoy the swimming pool. But this is where God started to bat me and I did enjoy this place so I have to love it. I have to embrace it. So guys today I'm working in the farm. You know you guys if you are new here kindly do me that favor and hit that subscription button. I'm a man on a mission to step into every country and its villages and also taste every kind of food.

many power and then so that they can help me have some holes and then how many bags do you need this place i need like 3 bags or 3 bags of yeah of corns so that it can finish this place yeah and i already have one i went i went to rongo oh to bring it from my mother and yours i managed to buy one so i have one i need also to to help them i need some like like 4 people come and help me plant is it yeah these guys so so so so guys i wonder why why they use that common language each and everyone why why all of you just using that common language yeah because it is our language you know let me tell you i want to be very very honest we were colonized by british people and they taught us english but the real sense when people learn by their own language like i could have they understand better because they learn by their own language and that's why you see the chinese and many people they learn by their own language so they lied to us they brought us this name this english so english is not it's just like any other language it's not a mesh of education or what that's why anybody can speak in english so we speak in our own language do you mean that the chinese are not speaking english yeah most of them they don't they learn by their their language but they don't speak english they speak i i'm not saying they don't speak english just get the point straight they speak english but it is not their main they learn by chinese that's why you see this my phone my camera my camera and i am not saying that they speak english but it is not their main they learn by chinese that's why you see this my phone my camera is made from china that's why it has you see so that's what i'm trying to say so we speak a lot of our vernacular language because that's what we know in the village here and we love speaking to our we cannot abandon our ancestral our ancestral language our ancestral language and we love speaking to our we cannot abandon our ancestral language our ancestral language language no so that is it and guys we are finished now plowing now what i need is planting so i will need like four men to come and help me so that we can plant it in one day this place in one day and i need like two more bags or maize but i'm gonna do it man i'm gonna do it yeah i will try my best my best but not tomorrow but when if it takes like two days yeah when if it takes like two days oh my goodness we will have done everything so guys so this is it so this is the village our village is called Nyataro Nyataro village yeah so guys i'm trying to carry it i brought
