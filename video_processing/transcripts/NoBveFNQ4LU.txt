 In preparation for hurricane season it'd be a good idea for livestock producers to review their health program because there's always the potential that animals may be relocated to a shelter or another farm to get them out of dangerous way and the other situation that could arise is you know storms can do a lot of damage, knock fences down and potentially then in that situation animals could mingle with other herds as well and just be exposed to other infectious diseases so having a herd health program up to date having vaccinations up to date would be a good thing. Another situation that could arise is when animals are commingled trying to get them back to their proper owner so animal identification is very important and it needs to be unique animal identification something that is specific to that animal and to that farm so for example hot brands, USDA, metal ear tags, electronic identification tags those would could all be potentially unique animal identification as opposed to say a dangle tag with just a number on it you know there's a lot of there's a lot of black cows in Alabama that probably have an ear tag number 26 in their ear for example so it needs to be something unique to that particular animal so that that people can get the animals back to their to their proper farms of course making sure that you have all the equipment on hand that you need to to respond to to a potential disaster making sure that you have feed and water available and in storage for one to two weeks potentially for stored feed it needs to be stored in a in a dry safe place and it needs to be someplace that's that's fairly secure so that you do have good healthy wholesome feed to provide your livestock after a disaster if you're on a well water source having hand pumps or generators available in case electricity is disrupted would be would be all be important things to consider ahead of time livestock producers should prioritize their animals so that they can be sure that those animals if animals do have the opportunity or the need to be evacuated those animals with a high priority can then be evacuated first or looked after first if the producer knew which animals were maybe getting ready to calve or kid or fall whatever the case may be put them in a in a location where they can maybe check on them first to make sure that there haven't been any complications or any issues that arise during the during the storm if you are in an area that is prone to flooding for example move move your animals to higher ground and ideally keep them out of barns they're usually going to be better left in large open spaces as opposed to confined to a barn the last thing you want to do is put your animals in there and then have the storm destroy that building with all your animals in it so they're usually going to be better off on high ground in large open spaces particularly if the horses are not used to being out in the pasture in that situation it may be safer and a better idea to leave them in a stall in a secure building because last thing you want to have happen is a is a is a storm to come in scare the horses frighten the horses and and they you know don't know how to handle that don't know what to do and they may end up injuring themselves more so than the storm
