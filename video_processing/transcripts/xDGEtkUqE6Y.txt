 Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Hi there, I'm Farmer Brad and I'm going to talk about chicken rental packages that I offer. We offer two or four hens for three or six months. Then at the end of the rental period you have the option to buy out and keep everything. So what I provide is the coop, the hens, the feeder, the water, and some feed to start with. The goal with the chicken rental package is that on day one of the rental you get fresh eggs in your backyard. Now I sourced the hens either from our farm or from a nearby farm so that they are just starting to lay. Okay, so this coop here is five feet by eight feet and this door you open up and that is where you access the feed and the water. And over here is where the nest boxes are and that's where you get your eggs. So I designed this coop so that majority of taking care of the chickens can be done from standing upright. So there is a release for the door on the other side and you end up pulling this cable and then that will keep the door open. This is a large enough coop that if you don't have a fenced in backyard you can just let the chickens be in there. And then I can also add wheels to this so it's easier to move around on your backyard. Now there are some additional fees such as the chicken replacement fee and the mileage delivery fee. So there is free delivery one way within 50 miles of Greens Fork and then beyond that there is a surcharge per mile. Also this year I am going to be offering up a senior citizen Bantam chicken rental package. And COVID has hit senior citizens the hardest and sometimes you just need that companionship. Now the Bantams are smaller hens so they lay smaller eggs but they take up less space. So when you go to the website you'll be able to see the pricing for those. In order to get the ball rolling there is a $100 down payment so that way if I don't have a coop on hand then that's enough upfront cash that I can start building one. The Bantam rental packages will be smaller coupes and it will be a little bit more affordable. So check out for the latest prices and details on farmerbrad.com forward slash rentals. Thanks and have a great day.
