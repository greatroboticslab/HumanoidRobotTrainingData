 We have Talking To Become Guys ** pressing consentiendo** ** cheering ** ** glatлена** Ricky & Boston Max Steinha So now I'm thinking about doing three roosting poles, one at 10. I think they should keep them far enough away from here so if they're pooping, their poop can go down here. And off the bottom, I don't think they're going to want to go right on the ground. So I was kind of thinking if I went 10, 25, that would give them 15 inches apart from each other. And then if I went 40 down here, that would give them 15 inches from each roots from each other. And it would keep them 16 inches off the ground. I'm kind of curious what you think about that. That's where I'm going to put the roost poles for now. I'd like to hear your suggestions in the comments below. I can always move the roosting poles around. So if you think that's a good number, let me know. If you don't, let me know why and what heights you would put it at. I know, it's not the proper saw. It's just a pole. It's just a piece of wood for a pole. It's just a piece of wood loars. I was so impressed. Every time I got a roost resort to a property, I should address aasive horse. I've been turned here toward looking for something. It will want fair enough to see it, but that's it. It will look like a pair. It's just the find there for a дня where you don't know. It's Loss line or something. Packery out. Weraid to the violent<|ca|>. I changed the windbreak at where you go down here. Now I've seen a pair of recreate types of trees. Got it. Alright, so now that we've got our three poles, we're just going to go ahead and secure them to the roof. Good job. What's that? Is that one going to stay right there? Nope, we've got to put that one up on this mark, so go ahead and put your end up. I'll pre-drill it. Down. Up like that. Perfect. Don't load it up. Ready? Uh huh. Alright, now we're going to do the water. We're going to make an automatic waterer again. I have this automatic waterer right here. It's from our old chicken coop. It's going to be using a 55 gallon drum. I'll show you that in a second. We're just going to set this up. A little dirty. Clean it out, rinse it out. But we're going to set this up. The girls will always have fresh water right in the bowl. I'm sure we'll put it in the bowl. I'm going to put it in the bowl. I'm going to put it in the bowl. I'm going to put it in the bowl. I'm going to put it in the bowl. We've got this 55 gallon drum that we had set up for collecting rain water that we're going to use. We've got two spigots, one up high and one down low. The one up high we use, the one that's filled up. We hook up a hose and run it for another 55 gallon drum. We just had it continuously in line collecting rain water. But for this purpose we're going to be using it for our automatic waterer. That's the reason why I left the stakes high. The garden hose can get slipped on. We just clamp it in place. Now the 55 gallon drum is all filled up. I actually over filled it. This is all filled up. You just got to be a little patient and adjust your float. You don't want it to overflow. You might have to keep an eye on it, see if the chickens mess with it or see if it gets disturbed at all and just keep an eye on that. And our old chicken coop we had this set up. We had the 55 gallon drum set up for the rain water catchment. So the chickens always in the summertime spring, the chickens always spring, summer and fall had fresh water in that. We never had to fill it up with a hose. It was just, we had a metal roof over the chicken coop. With a gutter set right into the 55 gallon drum. They always had a constant supply of clean fresh water. It was just, it was dressed all along. So post trash water if we actually need to digest Saturday. I am using laser button for the guy to ready to go it. Now we're just about ready for the hens. Put some hay in there, we'll let them get it right. I'm just going to leave this other bale in here for them. They can move it around and do whatever they want to do. I'm not going to go nuts. It's still a bunch of grass down. They'll eat all the grass and everything. They'll have fun with all this hay. A few extra bale of hay, I'll just leave them in there in the coop with the chickens. Now comes the fun part. We have to go get the chickens and let them in here and see what they're going to do. I'm pretty excited and interesting to see how the ducks are going to react to the water bowl. I'm sure they're going to love it. They're going to make a mess. It'll be a dirty water bowl after a few minutes, but they're going to have a blast with it. Hopefully the chickens don't mind. So that'll be another video, we'll be getting the chicks in here and the ducks and we'll see how that goes. Leave in the comments down below what you guys like to see for videos. Give me some ideas.
