I think they should keep them far enough away from here so if they're pooping, their poop can go down here. And off the bottom, I don't think they're going to want to go right on the ground. So I was kind of thinking if I went 10, 25, that would give them 15 inches apart from each other. And then if I went 40 down here, that would give them 15 inches from each roots from each other. And it would keep them 16 inches off the ground. I'm kind of curious what you think about that. That's where I'm going to put the roost poles for now. I'd like to hear your suggestions in the comments below. I can always move the roosting poles around. So if you think that's a good number, let me know. If you don't, let me know why and what heights you would put it at. I know it's not the proper saw, but it's just a pole. Just a piece of wood for a pole. Anyone else can be idpak .... got it? OK. Got it. Alright, so now that we've got our three poles, we're just going to go ahead and secure them to the roof. Good job. What's that? Does that one get it to the right thing? Nope, we've got to put that one up on this mark, so go ahead and put your end up. I'll pre-drill it. Down. Like that. Like that. Perfect. Don't load it up. Wait. Okay. My pine's okay. Ready? Mm-hmm. Alright, now we're going to do the waterer set up. We're going to make an automatic waterer again. I have this bowl, automatic bowl waterer right here. It's from our old chicken coop. It's going to be using a 55 gallon drum. I'll show you that in a second. We're just going to set this up. A little dirty. Clean it out, rinse it out. But I'm going to set this up and the girls will always have fresh water right in the bowl ones. I'm sure the ducks are going to love this. We just got this 55 gallon drum that we had set up for collecting rainwater that we're going to use. We've got two spigots, one up high and one down low. The one up high we used, the one that's filled up. We'd hook up a hose and run it for another 55 gallon drum. We just had them continuously in line collecting rainwater. But for this purpose we're going to be using it for our automatic waterer. So the reason why I left the stakes high. The garden hose can get slipped on. We can just clamp it in place. So now the 55 gallon drum is all filled up. I actually over filled it. This is all filled up. You just got to be a little patient and adjust your float. You don't want it to overflow. You might have to keep an eye on it, see if the chickens mess with it or see if it gets disturbed at all and just keep an eye on that. And our old chicken coop, we had this set up with the 55 gallon drum set up with a rainwater catchment. So the chickens always in the summertime spring, the chickens always spring, summer and fall had fresh water in that. We never had to fill it up with a hose. It was just, we had a metal roof over the chicken coop with a gutter set right into the 55 gallon drum and they always had a constant supply of clean, fresh water. Now we're just about ready for the hens. Put some hay in there, we'll let them get it right. I'm just going to leave this other bale in here for them. I can move it around and do whatever they want to do. I'm not going to go nuts. It's still a bunch of grass down. They'll eat all the grass and everything. They'll have fun with all this hay. A few extra bales of hay. I'll just leave them in there in the coop with the chickens. Now comes the fun part. We have to go get the chickens and let them in here and see what they're going to do. I'm pretty excited and interesting to see how the ducks are going to react to the water bowl. I'm sure they're going to love it. They're going to make a mess. It'll be a dirty water bowl after a few minutes, but they're going to have a blast with it. Hopefully the chickens don't mind. So that'll be another video. We'll be getting the chicks in here and the ducks and we'll see how that goes. Leave in the comments down below what you guys like to see for videos. Give me some ideas. What do you want to see?
