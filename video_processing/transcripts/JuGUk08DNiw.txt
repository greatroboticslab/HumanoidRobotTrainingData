 Agriculture engages a significant portion of the population in India and around the world. It is a seasonal livelihood where farm activities and incomes vary throughout the year. Backyard poultry farming can provide crucial incomes to over 70% of rural households in India, which amounts to about 30 million farmers. It is a cost-effective, easy-to-manage practice for personal consumption and a reliable secondary source of livelihood. By understanding the thermal, spatial and management requirements in backyard poultry farming, Selka Foundation has developed a DRE-integrated, climate-adaptive solution for tropical wet and dry climates. This solution was implemented with farmers in Karnataka, India. It is very important to note that the domestication of poultry is due to major factors of the environment climate because they are homeotherms. They adjust their body temperature to the environmental temperatures. Since they are homeotherms, their body temperature is 105 degree Fahrenheit and they are comfortable when the temperature is around 75 degree Fahrenheit after the brooding is over. The higher temperature causes stress, lower temperature also causes stress. We have to provide good sheds with cross ventilation, safety from the cats, dogs, reptiles and also the cross ventilation is very important. The cross ventilation is very important because the birds have to be kept stress free.之ia… In the cycle of compassion, we may have to be kept in trial and Kalani, not small fat.
