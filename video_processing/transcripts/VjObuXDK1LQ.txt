 Hey what's up garden friends Jeff here how's everybody doing I hope you're good I am great out here playing around with my caladiums and thought okay time to make a video on these guys they're actually long overdue and to do this a very long time ago I'm talking specifically in this way about caladium bicolor caladium bicolor has well over a thousand different varieties of color forms and patterns and shapes and lots of variation the majority of the ones I have here in my garden are just sold as assorted I just receive them as assorted plants so they don't have names I do have a couple of specific ones I will show you in a moment but for starters caladium bicolor hardy zones 9 through 11 part 2 full shade a consistently evenly moist soil that's organically rich and well drained they are considered toxic to dogs cats horses majority of animals and people probably should stay away from them and they are also known to sometimes be a skin irritant can cause some itching and burning for some people I've never had issues with that but it's something to be aware of and to be careful about the caladium bicolor is a heat loving plant so them being hardy only zones 9 and up that doesn't mean you can't grow them as an annual they're very often grown as annuals and they don't have to be kept as an annual you can lift them from the ground and store them during the winter time which I'll talk about in just a moment I want to start off talking about planting and then get to like kind of move through the season so spring summer fall winter starting out if you buy your caladiums like in a bag oftentimes they'll come in a bag just sort of a bunch of roots tubers packed into peat moss or soil sort of substance that's how I buy like the bulk of my caladiums they just come in a big bag full of roots tubers and I plop them in the ground just about two inches deep you can go down to four to six inches it just kind of depends on where you love how much precipitation you have the spring is really wet here and somewhat unpredictable so if temperatures are potentially going to maybe drop and you're going to have a cool snap and you have a lot of precipitation then the deeper you plant that tuber the higher the risk of that tuber rotting if the temperatures get cold that's why I like to plant mine kind of shallow the other reason that I plant them somewhat shallow is because sometimes it can be a little bit difficult when you buy them as these teeny tiny little bitty tubers to tell which end goes up and which end goes down typically the flat end goes down that's where the roots are going to come out and the pointy end comes up that's what you want pointing up when I'm unsure I plant them really very very very shallow and I plant them on their side by doing this then what will happen is the growth will go ahead and pop up whatever end it's supposed to and then I can just turn it poke it down a little bit deeper and problem solved then I don't have to worry about any type of damage or anything like that if I've planted it upside down not even damaged it's just it's not going to grow I wait to plant mine out in the garden when I'm sure that there's not going to be any more frost and temperatures are going to be nice and warm that's how they're going to get going if temperatures are really cool say like below 70 75 they're just going to kind of chill out that's what I meant earlier about if you have a lot of precipitation and where I live may is typically pretty warm but sometimes there's a couple days that are sort of cool and then that can be a problem if I plant them too deep and there's a lot of precipitation so wait till it's nice and warm out and they'll take off a lot faster they can also be started indoors four to eight weeks before it's time to plant them outside just throw them into a pot with an all-purpose potting mix don't plant them too terribly deep give them a light watering put them someplace warm that gets a lot of bright light and then get them going that way let's say you did start your caladiums inside or maybe you purchased them pre-potted kind of like these two right here then planting them is not complicated it's pretty simple just like with other caladiums here I have a caladium that is called frog in a blender pretty gross name has really cool foliage though I really like the foliage on it does remind me of like calacaja mojito something like that but even more dramatic and bold I really enjoy the foliage on this caladium then over here is cal or calacaja caladium bicolor moonlight which has just white foliage with some subtle veining in it these are the only two I have that are named so the others are just assorted caladiums I typically plant my caladiums up mostly with impatience I think they go really well together every year except for this year in my front yard I do a really big drift of impatience and I plant the caladiums directly behind them and they kind of come up just a bit above those flowers looks absolutely beautiful it adds a nice contrast a different shape and texture to everything there's something just fun and lush about it it's really pretty I'm working with a smaller pot here so I don't think I'll use an impatient in this in fact I'm probably going to keep this mostly as something where I can bring it inside and still have some plants in it during the winter months which I'll talk about that part when I get to the winter months main thing to remember when potting up a caladium is just don't plant them too deep if it's already something you started just maintain the same soil line and in here I'm using an all-purpose potting mix nothing special I did add a little bit of slow release to it just to kind of pump it up a little bit and some espoma biotone starter to help get things going you can see I have the top of this just a bit below the surface of the pot that when I water soil doesn't go all over the place but I'm not going to put the soil up any higher than where it's already planted and just kind of kind of leave that as it is fill in around just like you would anything else it's really very simple the main thing is just planting depth and when you plant them you may have noticed when I planted this in here I didn't loosen the roots too terribly much I just lightly touched them with my fingers they're a little bit sensitive to their roots being overworked so there's no need to do that unless it's seriously root browned unless there's a lot of swirling around the base it's just not necessary and this isn't really a planter video but I did pot this up with a justicia there's the tag the variety is called fruit cocktail this variety stays smaller only gets one to two feet high and it can go full sun to partial sun and I think it actually should pair fairly well with this colladium it's a very subtle justicia the flowers are pale there's not a lot to them it's simple and I kind of want that I don't want this to be a dramatic planter oh and I did pull a creeping jenny out of my garden threw it in there so it's gonna be a little wealthy for a while but it'll take root and take off and flow over the front of that pot very nicely creeping jenny's also can go with shade or sun so they do better what I think with a little bit more sun from my experience I'm going to keep this in a location where it's going to get several hours of morning light about four to five hours and it's going to be dappled throughout the rest of the day in the heat of the summer that could be a bit much like when temperatures are really into the 90s like upper 90s I may have to scoot it into a little bit more shade but I think it'll be okay I don't normally have issues with the colladiums in the sun as long as it's a darker leaf a very light leaf the lighter the color typically the less sun they can take so like this moonshine variety over here not going to do as well with a lot of sun it's going to scorch very very easily and then over here I have a planter I put together I don't know several weeks ago that I threw some colladiums in that are white with green veining and they've been doing fairly well with the amount of sun they've been getting they're getting a lot of sun I am getting much more of a compact stout growth to them though if they were in a spot where the light's more transitional where it goes from morning sun to dappled light throughout the rest of the day then they're going to come up taller and see more of the foliage and it's their preference for morning sun I think that makes me like them so much with the way they appreciate morning sun filtered light throughout the rest of the day that's one of the reasons they pair up so well with impatience just very similar preferences as far as lighting is concerned as far as watering is concerned like I mentioned these plants prefer a consistently moist organically rich well drained soil they don't like to dry out for too terribly long I don't often have issues with them wilting from drying out but the more hot it is the more airflow the more sunlight the more likely that is to happen so a good heavy watering in the morning really just does the trick for them that's pretty much all they need I should mention I'm referring to the active growing season when temperatures are nice and warm outside and they're in active growth that's when they like to be watered consistently it's another nice thing about planting them with impatience impatience are a really good indicator plant they wilt at the first sign of them needing water very dramatically they're very dramatic plants but then you know okay this area the soil is getting a little bit dry that's technically stress wilting is stress so it's best to water before that happens but sometimes it'll happen a few times and give you an indicator of how much time you have in between waterings the same goes for the caladium though you don't have to have an indicator plant they will wilt they will start to fall down and get a little bit droopy when they get thirsty so again if that happens a few times not the end of the world it'll help give kind of a ballpark idea of how often they need to be watered always tricky talking about watering with plants because there's so many variations when it comes to climates altitude latitude it's just lots of variables there just don't let them dry out for too long if the top inch or so of soil becomes dry not the end of the world but if they're containerized like this one over here if that full thing were to dry out that would be problematic I wouldn't let that happen fertilizing caladiums are somewhat heavy feeders but if you over fertilize it can scorch the roots in the foliage I typically just use an all-purpose liquid fertilizer I make sure that when I plant them there's a continuous release within the soil something that has fairly even numbers as I mentioned I do like to amend the soil with things that help make it more organically rich like the espoma biotone plant tone works well anything that's going to encourage lots of good beneficial bacterial and fungal type activity in the root zone good stuff then as far as liquid fertilizers are concerned I use those about every three weeks to just once a month during the active growing season sometimes if it is crazy hot outside there's not going to be a break in that heat then I'll dilute the strength on the package whatever it's recommended to about 50% just to help prevent scorching because sometimes like I mentioned that can be an issue it's not one that I've dealt with often but I've heard of other people having problems with that before I really like seaweed fertilizers the caladiums seem to appreciate it as well using an epsom salt can help with sun scorch if that's a problem you can do just a few tablespoons of epsom salt into a couple gallons of water and then dilute that watered into the plant that can help protect the plant from sunburn a little bit although it's ideal to just maybe relocate the plant if that's going to be a problem I may have already mentioned it I don't know I mentioned again because it's important no fertilizing during the winter months really even the fall I stopped watering mine probably the first week of September so that they have some time to kind of harden off the growth can calm down a little bit and that helps prepare them for being dug or moved inside now late summer into fall like I mentioned this is when I cut back on fertilizing and by the way this is for people who don't live zones nine and up this is for people who have to dig them lift them bring them inside if you live someplace where you can grow this as a perennial then just let it do its thing caladiums die back on their own no matter what the caladium bicolor takes a dormant rest so it'll do its thing and when you start to notice the leaves are starting to fall go ahead and just cut those off I'll be talking about that too when it comes to bringing them inside so let them harden off basically just let them start to chill their growth will slow down especially as temperatures cool a little bit and then when it looks like temperatures are going to be dropping below I'd say 55 to 50 outdoors well before frost approaches that's the time to go ahead and lift those tubers up out of the ground get as much soil off of them as you can trim the roots back trim the foliage back take them inside set them someplace to dry for a few days and then you can put them in a paper bag in a cardboard box something like that and pack them up with like some perlite some people use peat moss if you really want to be extra cautious you can also sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon on them or sulfur powder but that is toxic so be careful that'll help prevent funguses and molds and things from growing on those tubers while they're resting when it comes to storing a lot of tubers and bulbs the general rule is just to keep them cool and dry and dark so people will put them in a basement something like that if they're going to be stored someplace like in a garage if the temperatures are too cool then those tubers will have a little bit of die back on them and then the plants you get next year will be kind of small so that's why it's best to make sure it stays above 60 where they're being stored but if it's too warm then they're going to want to grow after they've rested for even just a few weeks so like i said cooler's better keep them dark and that's why i potted this one up with this justicia this justicia easy house plant they like things on the drier side during the winter months when temperatures are cooler i'll probably still lift the caladium bulbs out of there this plant is going to need watering fairly often compared to the caladium which isn't going to need it at all so i'll just pull that caladium out and do what i just talked about store it someplace cool and dry oh for people out there who have tried to grow a caladium as a house plant and they get concerned i get questions about this during the winter time whether caladium's not doing well it's usually because it needs to go ahead and rest i have had them grow for me during the winter when temperatures were too warm when they were under plants around something that i moved into my grow space but it's really long it's spindly it's not great it's better to go ahead and lift that cut it back and let them chill out for a while i should also mention they do flower you can grow them from seed if you let these flower heads once they've been pollinated fertilized let those dry off cut them pull the seeds out plant those up that is doable i think it's much easier personally to just divide them up you can just lift the plant up and use a clean knife scissors something like that cut them apart and divide it and plant them back out but the flowers are pretty unique kind of cool looking right they're typically hidden by the foliage though i'm using my hand here to pull that back so you can see what they look like but they just kind of hide down in there okay so now let's talk about problems with the caladiums when it comes to foliage discoloration typically the most common thing is going to be bleaching or photo oxidation from them getting too much light that presents itself as a discoloration a yellow like bright yellow spotting that fades into a white and that's what it sounds like it's bleaching if that's happening means you should probably move the plant someplace that doesn't get as much intense sunlight plant something above it that's going to provide some shade or put a structure here that's going to provide some shade that could be helpful i think it's really easier to just move the plant though common pests slugs snails aphids a lot of your outdoorsy type bugs the slugs and snails have been my main issue because they go places that are more shady that gets a lot of moisture places that i water often the slugs and snails where i live have been very bad this year you can see there are some small little holes in here from those just kind of the way things go i am treating with a pellet a bone-eyed slug and snail bait works really well there are lots of home remedies for getting rid of snails so try out whatever works for you it's also helpful to remember when watering these it's a little bit easier to water them from below so to make sure the water isn't splashing on the foliage too much because if that water settles there and then they get some sun on them it can leave spots on the foliage nobody likes that this is another reason that i really do like drip irrigation on my colladiums because they get watered from below there's not a ton of moisture settling on the foliage or on the stems down below which does help discourage the slug and snail activity somewhat having an abundance of things like ladybugs around lace wings and things like that can help a lot with pests if that's not helping then there's always neem oils and insecticidal soap systemics and like i said just kind of got to use what works for you okay and if you're growing your colladium indoors as a house plant during its actual active growing season then put it someplace with lots and lots of bright light a warmer location is better bright light inside is basically shade outside and windows can magnify things and whatnot so keep an eye move them if necessary but for the most part plenty of sunlight rotate the pot i'd say bi-weekly so that you get nice even growth and water them when the top one to two inches of soil is dry fertilizing the same inside as i mentioned outside monthly is just fine using a continuous release down into the soil works really well also if you're growing them inside and you notice that you're watering the plant and the foliage is staying wilty or yellowing and dying back that means it's getting too much water so cut back on the watering a little bit and do not forget to cut back on watering and fertilizing as the lighting in the day changes when the season progresses you start moving into fall and winter then you can go ahead cut back on that and start to let the plant rest you don't have to dig them and store the tubers you can just take whatever pot they're in let that dry out cut the foliage off and again store them just like you would the tubers take that pot put it someplace where it's not going to be getting watered someplace it's not going to be too cold nice and dark and dry after they've rested for several weeks i would say a minimum of eight to ten weeks you can pull them back out put them someplace nice and warm with plenty of light give them just a little drink of water not too much wait till you start to see some growth going on and then resume watering at a normal schedule and i generally wait on fertilizing when they start back for the next season until they've put up i'd say at least probably five inches of growth or three to four leaves i will however use a soil amendment like i'd mentioned the biotone starter a liquid starter something like that to help kick things off but i still wait until i see some signs of growth aren't caladiums just fantastic i love them they're pretty simple plant to grow if it sounded complicated that's just because i was being thorough they're really not hard to grow at all pretty simple indoors is always going to be more challenging but when grown outdoors they just they're fantastic they're beautiful they're nice to have in the shade especially the ones that have the more of a white foliage to them because they're luminous at nighttime they reflect a lot of light which is something i absolutely love with my plants i love my garden at nighttime so having the variations of color the stripes and the veining and all those fun things they make them stand out they have some contrast they're just beautiful y'all have some favorite varieties cultivars of caladiums let me know comment down below tips tricks corrections all the above get it down there in the comment section get a conversation going and just say hi i love talking to y'all i have all my social media linked down below down in the description you can follow me there i am on instagram more than anything else it's a good place to get a hold of me and i do update things like this
