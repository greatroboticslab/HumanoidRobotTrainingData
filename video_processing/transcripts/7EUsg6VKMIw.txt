 This is too good to pass out. I've got to show you guys while it's kicking the bale. I'll show you the windrow. This is the windrow we're bailing. Look at this. All this hay. Big gnarly windrow. Touching the bottom. I'm gonna get my contactors. Let's see if we can hammer a bail out. Alright, she's started. Just eat her. Eating her. Woo! Just hammering through it. I'm already at 46 inches. Getting a little full. Full bale. Look at that. So, that's for everyone who likes to run their mouth about Massey Ferguson bailers. Which I should say Heston because it's a... They are Heston bailers. And Heston... Heston knows hay. Guarantee you. These things are phenomenal bailers. But, uh... That's some big ol' heavy hay. So... We're gonna keep just hammering her down. I'm actually having to back up because I've got hay building up under my tractor. I've got another full bale in. So... I mean that's just phenomenal. Phenomenal. And this old girl just keeps just pushing her in. You can tell... There's so much hay there... That... We're just... The feeder house is completely full because those... Those rods that go back in there are just hitting on that roller. Just thumping away. That's just how much hay is in there. And it just keeps... Keeps chewing her. You know we're running... We're at 4 or 5 mile an hour. You know we're not... We're not running no 7 mile an hour but... You're not gonna be running 7 mile an hour in this. We're just... Keeping at her. Keeping at her. My goodness. But... I'll show you as much of this as I can. Alright. So... Ah, this should have brought my GoPro. That would have been great for this. Just seeing that hay roll through there. But... Whew! We got her just as tight as we can get her so... I don't care. Shelling the hay. Right about the end of where I rigged. Um... Those three wind rows together so... If it plugs anywhere it'll plug right here where those wind rows separate. And that's just cause it'll get a wad on one side. But nope. It's... Separated now. So now we're back to these two wind rows that are next to each other. So... I... I started in there and I was doing quite a bit of that and I'm like... Man I... I gotta get a... I gotta get a video of that. So... Well we're just... Pumping some numbers. So this is why... You know I've got my 8300 and my 7810. This is my baling tractor. My 7810. I've got the 7800 too. Just cause this transmission right here. I can just pop it out of gear and pop it in gear. And... Just quick. I think a VT would be nice but... Who's got that kind of money? So... Thanks for watchin'.
