 Hi everybody, it's Jim from Cornbread Hemp talking to you about part of our organic farming practices here on our organic farm in Central Kentucky. A lot of people ask what makes certified organic CBD better than conventional CBD products and part of that is about our organic farming practices. And one of those commitments is that we don't use any pesticides ever in any of these fields and that includes natural insect control and that's bringing in insects along the food chain that are carnivorous to the potential pests of these hemp plants, ladybugs and praying mantises. We import thousands of them into this field to control the insects that might attach themselves to these plants. So from farm to label, Cornbread Hemp is certified organic and that's a huge part of our commitment to quality for you. I'm Jim from Cornbread Hemp, nice talking to you.
