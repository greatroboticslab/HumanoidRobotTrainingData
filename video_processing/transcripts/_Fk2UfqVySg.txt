 Hi, welcome to another episode on this frosty morning. We're already on year four of pruning my apple trees, my three apple trees. Now there's a few things I want to mention before we get going, because these videos do tend to be fairly long. One is, you don't have to watch the other three episodes or parts necessarily, it's just that there's more examples there, plus you get to see the natural progression over the years, which is pretty fun. Or if you want, like I said, more examples, then they're there for you. I'll put them up in the cards here. Second is, it's going to be pruned to, all of my trees are going to be pruned to a modified central leader. Now, I have a video separately for that as well, put it up in the cards, and I just go into much more detail. If I had to include that here, the video would just be far too long. And number three, if you mess up, if you feel like you made the wrong cut or whatever, don't worry too much about that. The good thing about trees and shrubs and things is that they're alive and they keep growing, so you can always correct your mistake next year, as long as you don't completely butcher it to death and then, you know, have it die on you. As long as that doesn't happen, I think you'll be okay. So, that said, let's get to the first tree. Alright, so this is the first tree that I'm going to be pruning. And you can start at one of two places. Either you start in your main scaffold, or you start at your top scaffold. I'm not too concerned with the top scaffold. I mean, I have to select out some branches, but overall, I don't have to reduce the height or anything. I'm pretty happy with it. So, I'm going to start with the main scaffold, because that is just way too many branches here. I've definitely got to simplify this down quite a bit. I also like to try and keep my bottom branch and the topmost branch, which in this case I would consider it to be this one, just so that there's plenty of space in between each branch in the middle there. The only other consideration is that with the lowest branch, you want to make sure that you have plenty of trunk. You don't want it to be like all the way on the bottom, maybe like a third of the way up or something. That should be good. So, that spot right there is actually quite nice. So, this right here is my topmost branch, which is fine. There's nothing really wrong with it. This one, however, is not as great. I just don't like this weird vertical branch coming up so quickly after it starts going, because ideally you have it kind of come out at like a 45 degree angle, and then slowly kind of arch up, which this one isn't really doing that either. It kind of comes out kind of weird, and then it kind of goes down a little bit, which a lot of my branches on this tree do that, but overall it just doesn't look as good. There's also this weird jutting branch coming out, so I might as well just prune that off first, because it's sticking you right in your eye. And then I'm going to prune this off. That crow really wants to be heard. I'd like to ideally have a branch space or bud space in between each branch. And what I mean by that is, essentially just either if there was a bud right here and there wasn't a branch, I'd like to have that in between the next branch down below or above it. So, if I remove this one, then I'd achieve that goal, because then there'll be this space in between these two main branches that I'm keeping. So, let's start with that. When you're pruning, you want to leave a bit of your branch collar, which is where the branch thickens. Don't damage that. Leaving the branch collar will allow it to heal over better. So, I'm going to break my own rule pretty early on already. I'm going to make an exception for this one, because I quite like it. The only thing I'm going to take off is the part right here that's rubbing up against the house and leave this vertical one. Since it's at the tip, I don't mind it. On the next set of branches, I already pruned a branch off over here. You can just see the little swelling, the branch collar right here. So, that's good. There's already space in between this one and that one here. There's only one thing I want to change on this branch here. So, let me show you that. This branch, it's got this fairly weird fork thing going on. I don't particularly like that. I want it to be focusing its growth on the upper portion. So, I'm just going to remove this lower portion. And that's pretty much all I'm going to do to that. Again, leave a little branch collar there. Just like so. And that'll do it for that branch. See the guy up there? He's been here for hours. I think he's here to stay. It has been so far hours now. Because there were just far too many interruptions. But it looks like it's died down a little bit. So, let's keep going. Back here is a branch node that I... Or a branch that I removed last year. But the node is still there. So, there's a good spacing in between these two branches here. But as you can already tell, these two branches are directly competing. And so, one of them has to go. I'd like to keep my lowest branch. It's flowing out fairly decently. So, I'm just going to go with this branch here. That'll also free up this little area in the middle here as well. So, let's just remove that now. Leaving that branch collar intact. Like that. There's only a couple things left to do. So, the first thing is you can see that this branch is really long. Way too long, in fact. It's also kind of a fork, I guess. Because you've got another one coming off here. This branch. This branch is fine. Curls up quite nicely. But with this one, I just want to bend it over. So, it effectively comes out straight from the trunk. And I also want to prune it back because it is so long. To a bud, at least. But in this case, it looks like it's a little fruit bud. And it grows more upright. So, it can start to curve up. Kind of like what's happened here. But it just happened too far down. And it also ended up drooping quite a bit. So, I'm just going to tie it up for this time around. So, the first thing. Pruning it to this bud here. A fruit spur. It's not a vegetative bud. So, there it goes. The next two cuts are just to bring it back in a little bit more. And also just to kind of remove weird branches. Because you look at this one. It's so bizarre. But it has a branch that kind of grows up. It's vegetative, which is good. Like the fact that this is a fruit bud. Means it's not going to start curving up as much. But we'll see what happens with that. But this one is vegetative. So, I'm just going to remove this lower weird branch. All the way back. To that one there. And then the other one has a weird fork coming out. If you remember, if you've watched last year's video. I removed several of these. Another one formed. So, I'm just going to remove this one as well. And it'll end up in a fruit bud. Which is not ideal. I'd rather have this be a vegetative bud. But for now, this will do. Coming in on an angle there. And snip it off. So, that's looking much more manageable now. The next thing I'm going to do. Is just remove. Kind of what I did down below. But just leave essentially a branch node. Or bud space in between. So, like I'm going to remove. This one is. This is the top right here. So, I'm going to remove that one. To give the one back there space. I'm going to remove this one. To give. This one up here space. Because these are all. Fruit buds. I'm not really worried about leaving those. So, I'm just going to leave those where they're at. That branch collar. The next one. I will just remove this one as well. Because I have plenty of branches down below. If I ever need to replace it. So, that's looking a lot better. I am very pleased with that. Before we move on. There's a fruit bud down below here. But there's a branch. That comes out. Right here. That's trying to compete. With the main leader. I don't want that. So, I'm just going to remove. That branch. And try not to damage the. Fruit bud that's right beside it. Which is actually. A separate branch. So. See if I can do this without. Damaging that fruit bud beside it. Alright. There we go. Fruit bud's still intact. That looks a lot better. With the next tree. There really isn't that much. That I've got to do. As far as the lower scaffold goes. Because it's pretty much all done. In previous years. Like for instance. This branch here. Was removed last year. And then these two branches. Now have plenty of space. There's a bud over here. So this one has plenty of space. Same thing with this one. And then there's a fruit bud. I'm just going to let that do its thing. So nothing too crazy. Honestly. In the main scaffold. The only thing I want to do. Is just prune back. This long. Squiggly part. It's just way too long. Honestly. I would like to remove it even further. Than what I'm going to. But for now. I'm just going to prune it back. Probably. To this fruit bud over here. I only have a lot of other options. I thought about going back to this one. Because this is also a fruit bud. So I will lose a couple fruit buds. But that's okay. I'm going to prune it back to here for now. So here we go. That really just leaves the top scaffold here. And as you can see. There's a lot of branches. So one of the first things that I like to do. Is just identify which branches you like the most. For instance. For me. This branch here. I really like. It competes with the top. Which is that branch there. That leader. That's the leader there. So getting branches that compete with it. Will help keep it small. Or manageable I suppose. Same thing with this one. I like that one a lot as well. And then the one in the back. It comes out a little weird. Which I don't like. But of all the branches. This one is a pretty good one as well. And they all go their own direction. I also really like this one. But I'm probably going to have to remove it unfortunately. Because you can see. It's either this one. Or that one. And I like them both. So at that point you got to make choices. The top scaffold is all that's left. And I'm going to. First remove. Fairly obvious branches. That I know I want to remove. So for instance. I have this branch. That is essentially the same as this one. But this one is just far stronger. And I like it a lot better. So I'm just going to remove. That one. Small one. Leave the little branch collar there. That can come off. So that leaves space for this larger one here. And then I'm going to remove this small one here. Because I don't need that either. Like so. Which leaves space for this one. Back here. So next is that fairly major branch here. Leave the branch collar intact. And snip. Now the other one. I want to do. Is this one here. It's a vegetative branch. So I'm just going to. Green it off. And I'll leave this one for now. I'll leave. This one. And that one. It's not really hurting anything. So. Those branches can stay. Alright. So the last thing on the agenda. For this tree. Is to simply remove. The height a little bit on it. Because it's. It's fairly tall. A little bit too tall. Even for me. And this branch in particular. Kept getting caught underneath. The garage door here. So I'd really like to reduce that. So let's start with that. Now I'm going to remove them. Or prune them down to. These fruit buds here. So first. Take it out of that. That means it probably won't get. Too much taller than what they are. But it's alright. And on here. I kind of want to keep them. Fairly equal. So I've got a bud. Just right there. Which means I'm essentially pruning off. Last year's growth. And the whole branch here. Is loaded with fruit buds. So that's kind of nice. Just like that. I'm going to prune it back. To that one there. I don't mind this being. Still the tallest. Almost. And then lastly. This one doesn't look like it has fruit buds on it. Until quite a bit lower down. Um. I mean I kind of. Want to remove at least a tip of it. Just to bring it down to the same heights. Maybe down to there. Just a tip. Mostly. Alright. So it's the next day now. Yesterday there was just too many interruptions. Between the kids playing. It ended up raining for a while. And then there was also landscapers out there. With leaf blowers. And things like that. Just making way too much noise. So. I had to can it yesterday. But we're going to go back out there. And finish up that last tree. Alright. So there it is. It is raining currently. Looks like it's picking up a little bit actually. But we should still be fine to finish it up. But we probably shouldn't do that a little too long. Alright. So as far as the lower scaffold. There really isn't a whole lot that I would change. The only thing that I did do. Is to the branch that I like. Is I tied it up. So that. It comes up. A little bit more. And it doesn't stick out so much. I may end up removing. This vertical branch here. Maybe both. Not sure yet. But. Yeah. That's really the only thing I would do to it. The other branch I like as well. The only thing I don't like. Is how there isn't a. Bud space or branch node. In between these two branches. That's a little unfortunate. But there isn't much I can do about it yet. I don't really have a lot of options. So maybe in future years when some of these develop. I would change that out. And there's a lot of fruit buds on here. So I just kind of want to leave that this year. But yeah. Like I said. Next year that might change. So you're looking at the main scaffold right now. The top scaffold to be exact. And this right here. That's my leader. Which I like. This one beside it. I also like. But then you notice. I kind of want to remove this one right. Because you want to keep a space in between. Every single branch. Bud space. Branch node. In between every single branch. But this one also happens to be. Essentially the same. As this one here. However. This one has fruit buds all over it. And it's just a better. More developed branch than this one is. Obviously this one is a lot smaller. So this one is definitely going to be removed. In favor of that one. So let's start with that. Let's come in. Leaving that branch color. Like so. And then the one below it. It's not bad. Probably leave it. The one that I don't like however. Is this main one. It has a lot of fruit buds. You can see it has fruit buds all over it. It's kind of unfortunate. But as you can also see. There is not really a lot of space. These branches are extremely close together. Which I don't really want. So I'm going to remove this one here. Give you a little bit of a better view of it. But yeah. As you can see. It's way too close together. It doesn't make sense to keep them both. I was going back and forth. Between keeping this one or that one. But I just really like the way. That this branch arches. As compared to this one. This one is kind of weird and wonky. Can't quite see it. It's just out of frame. But it doesn't flow as well. So I'm just going to remove that. Leaving that branch collar again. Now the next one. You can see quite clearly already. Is that these two branches. Are essentially growing the exact same way. Which means you just want to. Ideally pick one or the other. So I'm just going to pick this one here. I like that one better. So I'm just going to remove that. Right at the branch collar again. There are a lot of branches. That are growing left. As you can see here. All these branches are growing left. And that's really one of the reasons. Why I was trying to hold on to this one here. Just because it's one of the few. That was going right. So hopefully in future. Something will develop. I do have this small little branch here. That may end up becoming that branch. I also like this one here. That's coming towards you. But I really just don't need these two here. So I'm going to remove those two. In favor of this larger one here. Prune that off. Prune the one beside it. So really the last thing. That I would like to do to this tree. Is to just reduce the height a little bit. Now this. To take this branch as an example. This branch is two years old. The first year it grew up to about here. And then the second year. It grew the remaining. Of that branch there. So all these buds over here that you see. Are fruit buds. So this was two years ago. This was first year's growth. And then the last little big grew last year. I'm essentially just going to remove last year's growth. So if I take this branch as a guide. Going to remove this to. Right above that first fruit bud there. And then I'm going to prune. The other ones to be. Kind of similar to that size. So prune that one off. To a favorable. Node there. Same thing. With the one beside it. It's going to take the tip off. Just like so. And that will do it. Alright. So I'm happy with that. And this next growing season. We'll see what develops. And see if I can maybe get a branch. Growing that way. Somewhere. That would be nice. To kind of fill it out. Although I guess that main scaffold branch. Is actually filling that space pretty well right now. But that will be something that I'm going to look for. Next year. We'll get there when we get there. I feel like all these other buds in here. They're fine. Most of these are fruit buds. There are some vegetative ones. I may end up removing that. You can certainly. If you want to. So. Anyway. With that said. Thank you all for watching. And I'll see you in the next one. Tot de volgende keer. Tot de volgende keer.
