 Rangelands make up a large part of the Western United States. 85% of Wyoming is considered rangeland. One use we frequently see on rangelands is grazing by both domestic livestock and wildlife. This grazing provided by rangelands is critical for healthy animals, but the health of the rangelands must also be considered. When rangelands are grazed in a sustainable fashion, rangeland plants are able to grow and reproduce, soils are protected, and the resources can serve for the future. Improper grazing can lead to weed infestations and soil erosion leading to a reduced forage base. Degraded rangelands can be rehabilitated, but recovery may take years and inputs such as seeding or other treatments can be expensive. Because rangelands are so critical for Wyoming's livestock and wildlife, it's important that we use them in sustainable ways.
