 Nowima Africa Temple Acoustic leaf c√≤n diz Good day everyone and welcome to the program, Agriculture on the Move. My name, Philip Sidney, your host. My guest today is a very important one, one you're familiar with, and you hear a lot from him today and he's none other than the Honorable Alfred Paul Prosper, who is the Minister with Responsibility for Agriculture, Fisheries, Food Security and Rural Development. Welcome to the program, Honorable Minister. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here. Yeah, and thank you for taking time off. I know you're very, very busy, but of course you have to tell St. Lucia what you're doing in your ministry. Exactly. Very true. And the farmers, you know, always, the fishers, the farmers, everybody in the sector, I'm sure they want to hear, they would like to hear what's happening. Definitely. And of course we're starting on the ball. One year. Into your helm, the helm of the ministry. A challenging one. A challenging one. Yeah. In amidst the challenges, Honorable Minister, what were your main achievements? Yes, and I must say it's good to celebrate this first year. I mean as a new minister, there were lots of challenges, but there were also some very, very good achievements. One of them that I must mention first is the state that we got the mandana industry when we came in. It was an industry that was almost lost. Our farmers had lost confidence in the UK market. Our farmers did not have the support to be able to allow them to buy the resources for the farms, the high cost of fertilizer, the high cost of other inputs. We had a problem with the NFTO, you know, not being able to have the financial resources to, you know, continue from where Winfresh left off. So these were challenging times. And today I must say a lot of progress have been made. NFTO was, you know, we were able to assist NFTO with getting the $3.8 million to assist them with the operations. We had a banana task force established to look into the whole industry, where it is, where we want to go, what are some of the challenges. That task was completed by a banana task force. We had a special consultancy done to really review the operations of NFTO. And then we moved further to re-engage the farmers to ensure that they produce the quality fruits that the UK market would get. And so far we've started. This week coming is the 10th week we've resumed exports of bananas. This is not something I will sit here and boast because this is not where I would like to see the industry at this time. But it's a start. But it's a start. It's a pro, it's, you know, some progress. But I really want to continue encouraging our farmers to produce the quality fruits that the UK requires and as well as the region. Currently we are exporting about 6,500 boxes of bananas to the region. And I'm hoping that before the end of this financial year we can increase that to 10. We were happy to engage Sainsbury, you know, and Sainsbury has indicated to us that they are more than willing to resume export, to sign a contract with us. But we want to see that a lot more, you know, will happen, especially with the maintenance, the consistency with the quality, the consistency in volume. But at the end of the day, our farmers too are under pressure. They are suffering because of the high cost of imports. And every meeting I attend, I know the call is what can government do? And I want to say to them, I really wish our government could do a little more. But we have had the COVID to deal with. And we now challenge by what's happening in Ukraine and Russia. And we know the high cost of gas fuel to be exact. And the government is subsidizing a lot in terms of the fuel, the rice, the sugar and so on. And it is a little unfortunate that the farmers are the ones suffering now. But I'm certainly sure in the next few months, in the next, in the short term, I'm certainly sure government will try its best to, you know, ease the pressure on the farmers. I want to commend, I want to say thank you to the government of Morocco on behalf of the government of St. Lucia for making available to us 3,944 bags of fertilizer. And all of that will be given to the farmers free of charge. I'm hoping that that will be a relief for the farmers. Unless they're vegetable farmers. Yes. Well, many of the vegetable farmers. And I feel sorry that, you know, the banana farmers cannot benefit from it because of the type of the various ratio. The ratio. The ratio is more appropriate for the vegetable farmers. In the fisheries sector, we've made some progress. We, you know, there was a passage of the Agricultural and Fisheries Incentives Bill. And it makes provision to, for people, persons who are in the CMOS industry, the fishes now can buy more of the products that they were unable to buy before. The lines, the hooks and all of those things have been made available in there. So that's a major achievement for the fisheries sector. We understand what the fishes are going for now because of the cost of gas. And our, my ministry has been trying its best to get what we call the fisheries aggregated device. What we call the FADS. FADS, yes. And we are really going to see how many we can get to spread around the island so it can reduce the pressure of the fishers having to buy gas to go too far out. And so they can go around the FADS and they can, you know, be able to still earn a livelihood. Currently we have free FADS and we're looking forward to see if we can get at least 10 before the end of this year. So we can have as many FADS as possible to assist our fishers. Very good, very good. Just a week and a half ago, we were able to open a new fisheries facility in San Bans Bay. And the opening of it was not just opening it and giving it to a private person, but we gave it to the fishers. So we have an MOU with the fishers because I want the fishers to be more involved in managing what belongs to them. Taking care of their own. You know, we have the LBO that is closed now since last year, December. The Blue Ocean. The Blue Ocean. And it is really impacting the fishers. But I really want to see that this step that we took last week in San Bans Bay will be replicated in Soufray, in Grosile, in Dennery, in Miku. So at the end of the day, the fishers will be involved in managing what is theirs. You know, this is the direction. This is my vision for the fishery sector. We are putting together the vessel monitoring device. We are hoping that our fishers will take advantage of it. So when they have any, they experience any problems at sea, they will be able to call and we will be able to locate them. Because as you mentioned that there's a gentleman in some few photos who's out at sea. And it may be sailing out there. It may be out there, but it cannot be found. Exactly. If there was that device installed, there's a strong possibility it might be located. Very true. We saw the closure of the end of the project life of the BPIP. Yes. And we have replaced BPIP with what we call a black cicatuka unit. Right. Because we understand the importance of men taking control of the black cicatuka problem in our banana fields. And if we have to maintain the quality, we have to ensure that we continue to control and take action to deal with the disease. So we have that unit in place and we are still helping that. And by the way, before I forget, I want to mention that all farmers who have quality fields will be getting a free cycle of oil from the BPIP. So I would like them to take advantage of that as a start in the right direction, you know, as a means of reducing on the cost of production. So these are a few of the things. You have the Seven Crops Program that was launched, the second phase. It's a five-year program commencing this year until 2026. And to the tune of almost $10 million, thanks to the Taiwanese government for making available those resources for us. And the whole aim of the Seven Crops Program is to reduce our food import bill. Our farmers will be getting fertilizer at a subsidized price. We are training a number of young farmers under that program because I believe young farmers are important for this industry, considering what is happening in the industry now. We are giving technical support to our farmers. We are having a number of farmers markets going around happening in Denry and all over the island. In this direction, I'm hoping that our farmers can benefit and take advantage of this. I was happy we were able to launch and host a banana festival. Yes. You know, our bananas, so many value-added products that can be made from bananas. I mean, this was followed by a mango festival. You know, on World Food Day in October, we are going to put together in Denry at Fondopark, to be exact, a CMOS festival. So we are really bringing together all those persons who are involved in, you know, those areas to really showcase, you know, the products that, you know, they are making. And to encourage our people, our locals to be able to buy and consume those products. It's fresh St. Lucia's best. It's fresh St. Lucia's best. We are progressing very well in terms of the, um, the Volet Livestock Station. And we are hoping that before the end of the financial year, we can move the animals to Volet and we can start a program where we can, um, you know, improve the livestock sector so we can get our livestock, livestock farmers, you know, um, a lot more involved in the livestock sector. And we can produce a lot of the meat that we consume. Mm-hmm. I understand the challenges in the poultry sector. I know the high cost of feed for the poultry and I know the 28 percent. There are issues that we need to deal with. But I understand what it is because I know the poultry sector, like the livestock sector, they are having issues with the feed. Mm-hmm. I'm hoping that, you know, some sort of assistance can come their way and we can make farmers a lot more, you know, comfortable that they can get the help from the government, they can get the support from the ministry and to be able to ensure that they can remain and be a lot more sustainable in the sector. Mm-hmm. In fact, you know, Minister, all that you have said there leads to one thing, you know, food and nutrition security. That's where we are. And this is where- And this is where- And you mentioned earlier on, you know, about the war in Ukraine. And the food security is more apparent now because our food prices in the supermarkets are soaring, right? Now, if, God forbid, something happened and the boats cannot come in to bring in, you know, those products that we need to consume, what are we going to do? We're going to have been a major crisis. We need to produce- Local. As much as possible. As much as possible. As possible to consume it. And that is why the agro-processing is crucial. And you mentioned the Badan Festival and the Mango Festival. These are things that we need to do to encourage people to do what we need to do and to eat what we grow. Cool. Moving forward, I heard you mention about the lockers at Savants Bay. But I was so pleased to hear the Prime Minister mention about the new jetty for Miku. Yes. And it's not a floating, it's going to be a stationary one. It's fierce budget. You know, so tell us about that. And it's a good point you're raising. Mm-hmm. Because it has, I mean, it's unfair to the officials of Miku. Oh, it is, oh, it is. To be getting something that they had no path to play. Exactly. They never contributed to it. They never wanted it. But it was forced upon them. And it's after just a few weeks. Yeah. And you're talking millions of dollars. Yeah. But right now, the announcement by the Prime Minister will give a lot of relief and hope. The intention was good, you know. But I suppose the assessment of the roughness of the seas on the Atlantic side, people that did not take that into consideration. Yeah, it was not appropriate for that kind of condition. So I'm very happy, you know, that the Prime Minister said it will happen. It will happen. And currently, we are in the process of, we are working with the Ministry of Infrastructure where they are looking at the costings, doing an assessment of the area, and to be able to come up with a very good structure that would be sustainable and it would be cost effective. Yes. And I am very happy for this good news that, you know, coming from the Prime Minister, and, you know, how that can impact the people of the fishes of Miku. Mm-hmm. And, you know, as we speak, they have another major problem affecting them. It's a gasp. Oh, it's a gasp. I'm seeing it all, by God. Yes. And it's making life very difficult. Yes. Difficult for them, man. I just want to say to them that, you know, it is, you know, a concern that, you know, the entire government, the cabinet has been discussing. Mm-hmm. And we are hoping that, you know, soon from now we can, you know, be able to do something. Yeah. To give some relief to our fishers in Miku. Okay. And those along the eastern. Beautiful. We are due for a break. You're watching Agriculture on the Move. Stay tuned. We'll be back very soon. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Food Security, and Rural Development is placing heavy emphasis on the concept of food security. It's our prosperity, our future. The enhancement of the efficiency of production distribution supply chain in the fruit and vegetable sector project, more commonly known as the Seven Crops Project, is intended to increase local production of all selected crops and decrease our food import bill through the diversification of the agricultural sector and increased production of the targeted crops. Among the provisions are subsidized input sales, seedling distribution, introduction of new varieties, introduction to new technology, erection of weather stations, and capacity building. For more on the Seven Crops Project, contact the project coordinator at 468-8122. Welcome back to the program, Agriculture on the Move. And it's on the move, people. A few, the lots has happened and a lot is going to happen moving forward under the leadership of Honorable Alfred Prosper, who is here, our Minister for Agriculture. Minister, we spoke a lot about your achievements and now let's look at what is to come. I know there's a COCO project, okay, and there have been so many COCO projects in the past. In the past, and they just died a natural death. I had Mr. Eloy Alexese with me a few weeks ago, and he mentioned about that new project. He's the coordinator, and then he gave some good reviews about that project, and I'm hoping it's going to be sustained. Tell us about that project. Well, this project is a project that was approved by during this for 2022-2023, to the tune of almost, I think it's $1.6 million. Right. And the aim is to propagate approximately 1 million COCO plants to distribute throughout St. Lucia. Now, currently we have lots, large areas of COCO, but a lot of those COCO plantations, or those areas we have COCO planted, these are not being maintained. So we have to focus on rehabilitation of almost 200 hectares to assist the farmers with inputs to be able to ensure that we get those plantations back into production. Now, I know we have the COCO pod disease that is a major... It's black pod, yeah. Sorry, the black pods. Thank you. That is a major problem in COCO, and it seemed to be discouraging a number of farmers from wanting to maintain it. But the thing about COCO is that we have a big market in the UK for COCO. We cannot meet the demand of the market. Now, given what is happening in the banana industry, given what is happening in the whole sector in terms of food security, I think that's a very good direction that our ministry is taking in terms of helping diversify the sector. Because I believe that, you know, whilst yes, we have been dependent on bananas, but within a few months, a few weeks from now, as we are in the American season, the entire plantations of bananas can be ripe off. So our farmers must be able to diversify so that they can depend on other crops growing on the same piece of land. And just imagine having a good mix plantation with bananas and COCO. The bananas as you fertilize the trees, the COCO benefits from it. So I really want us to do it differently this time because I remember in the past 10 or more years, we were given free plants to farmers. But you see, there's one thing to do that, but there must be maintenance and continuity. And continuity, yes. You don't just give it to the farmers and turn your back. So we have to be able to ensure that we take this project very seriously because I know it can impact the livelihoods of hundreds and hundreds of farmers, especially those farmers who are on their way to go. They may be moving out of bananas, but they still have some interest in, you know, going to the farm maybe once or twice a week. COCO would be an ideal for them because they can grow in there, they can do their trimming, but they can also do their harvesting. Right. Because the market is available. And what I liked about it, too, is that Eloy mentioned the shade trees. Yes. You can use economic crops, tree crops. Yes. That you can gain from it also. Exactly. Avocado pears, citrus and stuff. As opposed to the only Immortale. Yes. So you have a mixed cropping system that would really benefit from them. And even short-term crops, you know, while you plant in there, you're going to plant your short-term vegetables in between. Yes. And while you cannot pick up, at least you're getting some money. Exactly. Yes. And that brings me to the whole value added. Yes. We have a coco fermentary. He's sitting at Angers there. Angers. That need be commissioned. And I'm happy that, you know, I can mention now we have taken a decision to grant it to a group. And soon from now the group will be taking this facility on and, you know, getting it operational. Very good. I just visited the Barbano. The Faso Agro Processing Plant. I've been with, you know, Parliamentary of Virginia Albert yesterday. And we had a good discussion as to, you know, how we can get it back in operation. Because there are lots that can be done. There are so many, you know, high-tech machines that I saw there. You know, and we have to make use of it. But the good thing is that there are persons who are knocking the doors of the ministry indicating interest, you know, in wanting to take on the facility. And we cannot have such an important facility sitting there closed. Exactly. So we are looking at the possibility of doing that and ensuring that we can get into the whole value added, the agro-processing. You know, because every time I participated in this festival, in those festivals, I see the value. You know, the kind of products that I'm, you know. Fascinated by that, you know. And, you know, I believe these people deserve a place in society where they can display their product. And also think of exporting. Exporting, yes. Yes, yes, yes. You know. I mean, what's your amount of money from the CMOS industry? Yes. Six million dollars with the help of Export Saint Lucia. In one year. You know. And when I look at the value earlier, I had a guy here with me, you know, on Wednesday. And I saw, they might have 20 products right here. Right there. You know. And I mean, it's amazing what you can do. Yes. So we have to take those, we have to move in the next, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, we have to move to the next steps. Yes. Of taking all those products and exporting. Yes. We need to export. And the, in the various countries you can see Saint Lucia. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. And the good thing about it, look, look like the cocoa. We, we have chocolatey beans in Saint Lucia, you know. Yes. I mean, the, the, the rural women in, in, in, in Miku. There's a Miku chocolate. Miku chocolate. If we have, we have, we have can, we have canaries. We have, we have also have sofrere. Sofrere. You know, Jade Mountain. You know, and, and the other, other, other little, you know, cottage industries that they're doing it. So we can do it. And then of course, don't forget the cocoa stick. Yes. The cocoa stick. That's another big market in, in, in, in, in, and also in Martinique. And Martinique I heard. You know. So we, the market is available. It is there. We need to take it. And one of those challenges we have with, um, you know, the export market is, you know, transportation. Yes. You know, we, we need to really, you know, revamp and, you know, improve the transportation, you know, between countries. So you can move our products, you know, easier. Agro processing is key. In fact, that's why after this, this, um, festival coming up on the 16th of October, which is World Food Day, which is the CMOS, um, um, Fiesta, we are looking at the cocoa, right? Back to back. And we're also looking at coconuts. Coconuts. Yes. Right. So we need to show what we can do and the rest of the world. And what is amazing about our CMOS, we produce the, probably the best CMOS in the world. Yes. Yes. You know, and this is impacting the rural people so well. Mm-hmm. That, you know, we must ensure that we, you know, we regulate it in our manner that. There was a good rush, you know, you like that? It was. I mean, I had a lady here with me from, from, from Moshi. And she said nothing to do, nowhere to go. They start walking the beach and they say, let's do some CMOS. And that is how. And that is how. And this is involved in a product here, gummy, gummy bears. Gummy bears. For the kids. And to CMOS. And she will be at our thing too. So there is a lot. And I, and I just want to, you know, say that I, I, I am really looking for the resources that, you know, and, you know, that I need, that is needed to really assist those persons living this. Because they need the support for them to be sustainable. Transportation, you mentioned about, which is markets. The market. Now, we, we, we, we know that you had a trip to, to London not too long ago. Mm-hmm. And you were told that there's so many other commodities that we can export. So tell us about that. Yes. There, there is, there, there is a, a guy I met and he's, he's looking for mangoes, avocados, green and, and, and, and. And yellow. Jelly coconuts. Jelly coconuts. Jelly coconuts. Plantin. And he, and he, and he dashes, I'm sure. And hot peppers. Yes. Yes. Yes. And, and he's, he's going to be here sometime next month to go around to see how we can engage a number of the farmers to be able to, you know, generate some interest in being able to get those commodities, you know, exported. But what I am, I'm, I'm thinking, based on my discussion with him, that would be an excellent opportunity for the marketing board. Yes. To embrace this. Yes. Yes. And begin the export of those commodities to the region as well as the UK. Because the demand is there for a lot of the, the, the, the, the, the things we produce here. And, you know, as you mentioned marketing board, we have, you know, you've been having those farmers meetings, eh? You had one, the other one night before. Yes. Night before. And limited hours. I mean, and the, I mean, the feedback was really, really, really productive. And a lot of it came to marketing of their crops and they have no, well, the, the, the, the, that trust in marketing board is still shaky. Yes. So again, I'm happy that you have a new, a new manager and hoping that things might change because we need, all what they need is to the assurance when they sell the following week and get them money, you know? Yeah. And that is a very good point to raise in there. Because I always see the marketing board belongs to the farmers and the farmers would be more comfortable selling to what belongs to them. But at the end of the day, the farmers also have to think of their livelihoods. They have to invest some of those funds from the sale of the produce back into, into, into, into. Yes. Pede labor and okay. I feel like those are inputs and stuff. And when you have a situation where the marketing board is unable to pay on time or unable to buy as many, as much as possible, it's going to be frustrating and demotivating. All right. And the farmers in this case will have no choice but to go to Massey and to other areas. Mm-hmm. But I, I, marketing board is in a financial crisis now and it is a, a discussion that we have in the cabinet level. And I'm hoping that soon from now we will be able to, you know, relieve the marketing board in terms of giving them some financial support. Mm-hmm. So, whether it's a loan, I think more likely it will be a loan. Right. To really get it back on its feet because the marketing board had quite a bit of money a few years back. Of course, this export. Yes. But, um, I was told it was mismanaged or it was, yeah, it was buying in already. Yeah. So, those challenges are what, you know, the marketing board is faced with now. Mm-hmm. So, I'm working hard to see how quickly we can get them to have the financial resources to be able to buy as much as possible from the farmers. Okay. The farmers should not be asked to produce. But yet when they are ready for harvest, they have to wonder, where am I going to sell? Yes. How much am I going to make? You know? Who's going to pay me all the time? Exactly. Exactly. It's really, I mean, I understand what the farmers go for. Mm-hmm. It's not a nice thing for them. Mm-hmm. But, you know, those challenges have been there. They're real. They're real. They're really finding ways to really deliver. Yeah. Very critical. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Your constituency, I know you have your fishers, you have farmers. I know you have told them what you'll be doing. Yes. As far as agriculture and fishing is concerned. Yes, concerned. Tell us about that. Yeah, well, my constituency, I must see, I am very thankful for, you know, some of the things that we have done. I've been able to, you know, bring this, the people in the constituency together and really make them understand this thing, this thing is not about me on my own. It's about everybody coming together and everybody coming to work towards the improvement of the community. Mm-hmm. We had this cleanup where most persons came and, you know, did this major cleanup on the beachfront. Mm-hmm. We are now having activities, trying to have activities every month to really revive and to get, revamp the whole Saturday Fish Fiesta. Right. We have two major events there. We're hoping to have one at the end of every month until I can get the Saturday Fish activity back to where it was. Very good, very good. Very good. I do not want to commence this activity, this Saturday Fish thing with the same, you know, tents and so on. Mm-hmm. And they, they, they, they, I would like to see the ambience, everything, I mean, change, everything change drastically. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And we are working towards that. And the council, I must say thanks to them for the support. But we are seeing the people beginning to embrace it. They are happy with the activities we're having. And what we are doing is using a lot of our local talent. Right. And then we segment and some of the local people. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. To showcase their skills and really give back some of what, you know, they have. Mm-hmm. And I must say I have done quite a bit in terms of the whole social aspect, the housing. Mm-hmm. Between August and now, I've built almost 20 houses. And I've prepared quite a bit in terms of, you know, helping, you know, windows, doors, you know, assistance with people building their roofs, et cetera. I want to continue that. And I want to, you know, urge the people of Denry, we really let them work together. I am looking forward to improving just the fisheries facility, the Daito, because the conditions there in terms of the drainage, in terms of the area where the fish cleaning has been done, this place is in a very, very bad state. And I'm hoping that from funds that was approved for this financial year, I can, you know, make some improvements there and order fishing facilities in St. Lucia. I'm also working towards the whole land rationalization. Mm-hmm. I'm in discussion with people in the ministry to see how they can begin, you know, assisting the people in the, of Denry who have been occupying lands for more than 40 years. Eons. They have huge buildings, all concrete buildings, and they don't own the land. It's making it difficult for them to get alone, et cetera. I'm hoping that we can begin that process, too, you know. Mm-hmm. So that plus, you know, the young people building the capacity, et cetera, we're working towards that. Mr. Minister, boy, there's so much you can talk about, eh? Yes, a lot, a lot. Yeah, but our time has come. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Mr. Thank you for being here, and I wish you success. And I know in the new year coming, a lot will be said. A lot. I'm looking forward to. And we're looking forward to get more projects. Thank you again. Thank you very much. And I wish you success and Godspeed. Yes. You've been watching Agriculture on the Move with me, of course, on the Blah Fred Prosper, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries, Food Security, and Rural Development, telling us all his achievements and proposed projects to come. Thank you again. Remember, agriculture is our business. Eat fresh. See you next time. I'm Philip Sidney. Goodbye. Family Master. She's regained duty to Woof where killed, until $6 6049.
