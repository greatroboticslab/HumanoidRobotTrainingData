 We're here today at Dr. Higa Farms announcing open access to our blueberries right into China. This is going to be a great benefit to farmers right here in British Columbia. Opening more and more markets for us is obviously helping us to market our product, to keep the prices up. As the blueberries are coming on more and more we need more places to ship them. It's a great thing for blueberry producers because it allows us to diversify our markets. It allows us to employ more labor, keep labor force more active. It allows a whole host of things. Opportunity for higher revenues on some products. And hopefully over the next few years as we wrap up we'll get about 65 million dollars more in export value out of our blueberries into the Chinese market.
