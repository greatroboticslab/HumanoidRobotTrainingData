 Hi, I am Adam Krull, veterinarian and nutritionist for Pioneer. Today I want to talk to our cow-calf producers about weaning and how we can do this successfully. To do this successfully, we want to try to make as few changes to this calf's environment as possible. So having a place where our calves can go and eat ahead of weaning that will be where they will eventually be weaned into is an ideal situation. The use of a creep gate to allow the calves to go into their own area where they can be fed a supplemental feed such as a commercial creep feed or a feed with highly digestible fiber such as soy hulls or soy hull pellets is really important. Another thing that can make weaning very successful is having a high quality alfalfa to wean our calves onto. This should be an alfalfa that is at least 20 percent protein and at least 180 of relative feed quality. It's important when we're looking for alfalfa to start our calves on that we really pay attention to relative feed quality and not just relative feed value. The big difference is relative feed value just quantifies the amount of fiber that is in these alfalfa bales and the relative feed quality determines how digestible this fiber actually is. And this is really important as our calves brumen is not as efficient as a mature cow and so we really want a highly digestible forage to start our calves on.
