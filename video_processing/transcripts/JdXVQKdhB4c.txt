 Music When gardening and caring for onions and garlic, there is sometimes confusion on what exactly to do. For garlic, we always want to top the plants to help build the bulbs. For onions, however, we do not want to cut or top them. If we find onions in our garden that look similar to these with flowers, we want to pull them immediately. If we have onions that have not flowered, we want them to continue growing naturally until the stalks have fallen over by themselves. We want to make sure to pull them out on a hot, dry, sunny day like we have today. Once we have pulled the onions, we'll want to leave the stalks on and let them cure naturally in a cool, dry place for two to three weeks. After that time, we'll then want to cut the stalks about one to two inches above the bulb, and then we can use them for storage. We'll want to store the healthy onions by themselves, avoiding any damaged or diseased onions with the healthy ones. Some varieties may last two to three months, while others may only last one to two weeks. From the University of Wyoming Extension, I'm Brian Sebade, and you're watching From the Ground Up.
