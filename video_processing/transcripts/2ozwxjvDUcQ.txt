Broccoli is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients, making it a great addition to your fall harvest. Moving on to beets. Beets are not only vibrant and colorful, but they're also quite hearty. You can plant them in late summer, and they'll grow beautifully in the fall. Plus, they're versatile, you can eat both the roots and the greens. Finally, we have spinach. Ah, spinach. It's super easy to grow and thrives in cooler climates. You can plant spinach in late summer for a fall harvest, and it's packed with vitamins. Just make sure you keep it watered, and it will reward you with a lush crop. Now, here's the exciting part.
