This is one question which I have been asked with different people And a lot of people who are living abroad Mostly the explorers So I decided in order to catch up with them In order to help them I should say my comment on this But this also will be useful not only to people who want to invest in Tanzania But also for other people who are living in other areas And they want to do agriculture Mostly in Asia Africa and Africa You can use just these few techniques They might help you in one or different way So let us go together and enjoy First thing you need to consider is not just the matter of starting farming But you must choose a kind of farming that you are capable of and you are interested in What do I mean saying this? People they are just entering into farms just because they are just told that when you do farming you might get rich In order to be a successful farmer you should not just drag into farming just that way You must have an interest and capability to start that kind of farming That is a very important thing because success or failure starts from that point Second thing you need to consider you must have knowledge on what you want to farm People must start having questions Oh don't Oh I am far Oh I am not staying where I do farming How can I How is it important to have knowledge on what I want to farm Don't worry It is very important to know what you are doing For example In order to know every step of maize and how you will get profit You must be aware of how maize is grown and every process of growing maize It doesn't matter how far you are But you must also have a person who is capable and who is knowledgeable concerning the kind of farming that you are doing Even when you are not there or you are not around He or she can stand on his duty so as to make sure everything is going as planned But it is very important for you to have Not only you should go to school but you can Nowadays life is very simple You can google, you can go to youtube and whatever And have some basics and knowledge on what you want to farm This will help This is important in cost management Hope you got what I mean Another important thing is good farm management This starts from the person or expert you are using From the equipment you are using From the inputs you are using All of this must be good And must be done collectively So make sure you invest much in good practice Because when the farm practice is not good You can just end up in getting losses which are not necessary For example when the farm is not clean You can just welcome some pests and diseases For example when you don't put all requirements For example seeds When you don't plant seeds on time When you don't put fertilizers on time When you don't cultivate on time All of these will be problems So you must have a good farming practice Starting from the good expert you are using So as to take care of your farm Last but not least you must plan your market You must know how you will deliver your products to the customer You must know who you are your target customers You must know how you will do your business How you will sell your products And much more Because when you don't plan You might just obtain a lot of yield But you don't know where to sell them So you just end in selling them by losses Or by cheap prices Or many of the products might be rotten So in order to be a successful farmer You must do all of this But also be good in planning your market Be good to know where you will sell your products And whatever Top day Let's just end up Hope you have just obtained something Or you have got something which might help you And see next time This is Zubaba TV And this is Zubaba Iman Considering subscribing And hit the bell So as to be a member of this family Till next time And have a nice day And have a nice day
