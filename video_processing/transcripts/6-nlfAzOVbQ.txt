Howto & Style
 So the first thing we want to get doing is set up this plant in one of our net cups. This is a three inch size and you just want to be able to make it so that at least a couple of those roots are coming through the bottom just so that they can find that nutrient water. It doesn't have to be very much. And then we're going to use our clay balls here. So these clay pebbles offer stability around your plants when you are setting them up in the net cup. So you just kind of put them around. They also help keep the light from getting through to your nutrient water.
