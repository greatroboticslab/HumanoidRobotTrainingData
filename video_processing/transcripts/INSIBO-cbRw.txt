Education
 Music If you have gardeners on your gift list, one of the things you might consider is books. There is a variety of books by authors from all over the world, and if they are needing information for their own region, like here in Wyoming, we'd recommend authors that write from somewhere in the Rocky Mountain region. If you're looking for a gardener that's someplace else, you might want to think about their region as far as the sources of the gardening information. If you're thinking about just great plant books, this is a new book that's on the market now and is just about a variety of plants. And of course, plant information is the same the worldwide, so this looks like a great book about a variety of different plants. Another thing that's great for gardeners, no matter where they are from, is a garden journal. And this is a journal that's out on the market right now and is great for gardeners to keep track of their notes and their plans for gardening at their site. One of my favorite treasures from my grandmother is that she always kept a journal and made notes every day. And of course, during the garden season, we would know whether she'd had rain that day, whether she got out and weeded, whether she planted peas that day. Another thing that's good for gardeners, no matter where they are, is information about using what they grow in the garden in the kitchen or planning a kitchen garden.
