 The She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene I said don't mind but what do you mean I am the one Who will dance, who will blow, and around People always told me, be careful what you do Don't go around breaking them girls' hearts Don't make me feel She came and stood right by me, cause I smell a sweet perfume I guess everybody's who, she's calling you The pretty she is not my love She's just a girl who cleans the eye of the world But the she is not my son She said I'm the one But the kid has met my son Daddy Honey, you're so sweet зуб 2x2 Ła Verm
