 greetings my rantians hope you all are doing well today and welcome back to another episode of anno 1800 i am very very excited today because we're going to be starting on a whole new set of islands and these are given to us by none other than mr major himself the banner designer for the imperium and i'm so excited to get these going but before we do all the you know talking about the lore and all that stuff i just want to mention if you did happen to come across the channel now and you do like what we're doing here by all means feel free go and check out the channel see if there's something that interests you and if you are definitely interested in one stick around we'd love to have you the imperium grows very rapidly every single day and it's one click away if you decide to do so but now i want to get into the lore behind the kingdom of sapin the kingdom of sapin was la corona's biggest ally in the border regions one of its islands being directly annexed by la corona following a succession crisis in the kingdom as such the kingdom is made of a bulk of la corona infrastructure and fighting capability the kingdom of sapin was also behind the imperium's only defeat in the border region conflict as it successfully defended their land and were able to ensure that la corona's vanguard forces were able to flee back into safety following the ceasefire the kingdom of sapin was stripped of its capital and the isle of belfort was given to the imperium as collateral although the queen has accepted rantian help her people and especially the nobility remained very divided as to the current balance of power and some of them straight up opposing rantian intervention in the region however our goal is to win the hearts of the sapini people we did have to do what was necessary in order to win the war that that much is clear but i did not want it to be at the expense of nations that were pulled into it this nation in particular of whom was extremely strong has a very long history and is even deep rooted with la corona itself our goal is la corona our goal is not to destroy any nation that aligns with them because we don't know whether they've been in any which way shape or form coerced into doing so and that is why we are here today why we are going to work to restore the kingdom of sapin to the best of our ability and improve our relations with this incredible kingdom naturally we're going to face our own challenges that is for certain we don't have access directly to imperium supply lines but we will make sure that our fellow rantian protectorates in the region help us with the restoration of not only the first island that we're working on being the island of remoray which i'm hopefully i'm saying that correctly but also for other islands that are based with the kingdom of sapin itself and there are a couple of little checkpoints and missions and quests that we have to do mainly the objectives part is the most important for me so now getting out of the role play for a second what mr major has done is has essentially when we broached when he broached the subject to me way back he was telling me that there were certain bits of tasks that he would think is really the best way of going about winning the hearts of the sapini people and i really like that because it you know obviously builds upon the lore and the reason why we're doing this because i mean in the grand scheme of things would the imperium 100 want to restore a nation that did fight it even though we didn't see them as a true target not particularly because that's our time and our resources but we want to make sure that the world is shifting in our favor and we're going to do this the best of our ability so the main objectives here are to place the training posts in the middle of the emplacement which is going to be right over here every house and service must be built on the water which means something kind of similar to what we did over here with imperial albohan which they were very very impressed about that we were able to rebuild this nation over down here this also goes into specific skins which i won't go over here we'll just talk about it when we get to them we need to have a population of 500 farmers and 500 workers with specific skins for those ones which we will see in a moment have every mine and pits running with electricity that should be simple for us to do place at least one dream spire and a statue of lady morning star on the island totally fine no nwcu infrastructure allowed sorry shadow that's that's literally right here i can't do anything about that man you you have to fix this i i can't help you out with that buddy and no market stands allowed so the little guys that we have just as a little reminder for everybody the ones that we have like right over here so without further ado let's get to work because there is a lot of stuff that we have to do and it is going to be a doozy of a build so first and foremost i do have a bunch of images that mr major has provided to me in order to make sure that this works properly and i very much appreciate not only the time but the willingness to do so right it's really important and what i've done in the meantime is bring over a whole bunch of resources so we don't have to worry about your leadership hopefully we'll see that happen here very quickly so the very first thing that we want to do is we want to try to pre-plan everything and every airship that you see here minus this one this is for another uh another settlement that's still based with the kingdom of sap in itself these three plus the ship that's bringing a whole bunch of resources over from new albion are part of this island and only designated for this island so the very first thing i'm going to be doing is building up this oil refinery and shutting it off because there's no reason for it to work if this thing wants to be any louder i'm not entirely certain but we are going to also get the main roads built up and we're going to start it off by bringing it up to like somewhere here and this is going to be real important what's coming up it's it's really crucial it's really crucial we're going to be going over here to the ranting imperium ornaments and now i have to find it's this one awesome get the other base going banner and banner so pretty so pretty love to see it it's awesome so in the very middle we are going to be putting an administration building for landowners and we're going to have to increase the population size here quite a bit in order for this to really work but this is going to be the first place for it i think this is not a bad spot actually you know what let's bring it a little bit further up i'm just trying to see what would be the best place because there is a little hill right over here so i think if we put this thing like maybe right here it would be kind of okay ish maybe no i i changed my mind i changed my mind it needs to be built on the road what the heck oh that was weird it had to it had to fix itself up for a second so we'll put this one right over here i can't follow the diagram exactly as is because we i did not know that there was a freaking hill over here but what i'm going to do is because the road actually does go down to here i'm just going to bend it and bring it down so at least we have our foundation set right here i think there will be indeed look at this look at what the game makes me do there's one way to go through here with the train tracks and we want to get that sorted so we at least get some oil going right now and i'm trying to see as far as where the oil should go it should be right over on this side so let's go ahead and get the oil harbor situated as well and i'm going to build it right here along with its oil stores because i mean this is going to be important considering what we're going to be doing here oh crap it don't okay it's even it's even god bless awesome all right so that's the next step then we want to connect up the train tracks with the oil refinery which is back here and we're going to go ahead and do the typical tactic of having the parallel tracks but they're going to have to go in a particular way not necessarily straight on i don't think it's possible but we can try it uh let's go from back here maybe uh is it still connected yeah i think it is still is all right there we go let's go from about here might be a little bit too much i lied we're gonna go from over here and i will try to bend it up just so we can bring it right past the administration building because that is kind of the plan here and i'm going to get rid of this one what did it do anything over here oh they're not connected what the hell all right now they're connected great i'm gonna leave one row in between that's open like this and just keep it let's bring it to about here and then from here down it didn't want to connect here either for some reason today just doesn't want to cooperate with me and then in here we're gonna connect it up with the second side make it look a little bit easier in that regard and we're gonna bring it all the way down to here which it doesn't exactly line up but it's still fine we're gonna do it anyway and we're going to do the same with this now the island of remorae hopefully i'm saying i don't want to say it the american way the remorae i will i'll say it i guess in that way for now remorae is meant to be a breadbasket region for the kingdom of sapin so naturally getting this place built up and if we can get some really decent trade relations going here that would be fantastic because i mean what we're planning here is going to be pretty substantial now i have to unfortunately do this which is to link up a couple of these tracks together otherwise it's going to give me that hard oh yeah parallel tracks yeah have fun with that champ go ahead and link this one up and then this one up and that should be pretty good so what we're going to do is start this up and that's going to be one second oil that's wonderful and the cool thing is when we actually colonized this island we were able to get the i think it was uh unifier yeah i think it was unifier yeah so plus 100 island workforce for this so regardless of whether we had any workers here at all this is still going to work out just fine and i think just based off of the uh the vibe that i'm getting we should go with the steampunk type skins so let's go with the steam liner and that's the only ones that we will see here now what i want to do is start getting to work on the main harbor area which is going to be absolutely crucial and i also do have a little bit of a bit of diagrams i can pull from if in order to do so i really love it that you guys are are doing this i really do so it may not be exactly how it's set over here but we're gonna do our best because the big betty areas we'll have to go over and where the hell are even the big betty's right over here monster guns well we're gonna need some soldiers over here in order for that to work but this is meant for one and this is meant for the other so those are gonna be the two spots there and then more island storage capacity is going to be right next to it over here and i'm gonna do the same i'm just gonna bring it down to make it even with this one i think it'll be even let's see i could potentially even put it in front but i want to make sure i follow the diagrams to the best of my ability there we go i think that's pretty good for now and just in order to make this spot look nice we can either try to put another pier or another depot right behind it but in this case it's not going to fit properly so i'm just going to do this and i'm going to cover this up with some of the keys over here should be okay but this spot is just different because the the way that the shoreline is is a little bit wonky so we have those and we're going to get some more depots going specifically to have them face inward a little bit like this so the ships should be able to come into the main harbor area and even in this particular situation we can have some more there are spaces in order to have some additional depots like there there can be one there i think if i position this a little bit different we can have one there too but i think on over on this side i will just fill this out with key streets and then later on this is a really cool thing every time someone has a suggestion and they're watching the videos they message me later on and they talk about it so then i'll know what to do later on and fix the areas that they want to have fixed that's really really cool along with that we are going to go ahead and get the fisheries built up so the fisheries i think what i'm going to do actually is just hug the road along the depots and the key over here my mouse wants to work that's a whole different story in and of itself and bring it out a little bit over to about here gonna do the same on the other side uh that doesn't look fantastic over there i don't like it when it swaps i was gonna swap at some point in it unless i fix it right now i guess i can do that let's see how far it goes we'll bring it to about here okay and we'll bring this over to about here and the cool thing is because the kingdom of sapon has ties to la corona through marriage and just the longevity of their whole you know relationships and whatnot they have some valuable intel that they can provide to us we need that intel in order to get to the new world that's la corona's base territory we have to make sure we get this information and that's another reason why we have to be on their good graces let's go ahead and build up some of the initial fisheries right over here so we'll have three fisheries and then another depot area which is going to be right about here and it's literally going to be mirrored on the other side as well so like right there uh are any of these the old town skins shoot that's what uh you need to change you need to be this one until we get some people actually here i'm probably going to stop the production of like these two to follow because we just don't have enough people so stop you and stop this one that actually looks very cool to start off that's for certain and then there's a couple more fisheries over on this side so we'll have one over here and one over here the airship is coming back love to see it just trying to make sure that it doesn't swap its skin on me this one ah there it is and this one pretty cool go ahead and bring that down to here and bring this one down to here pause you pause you i'm not doing the shift tactic because some of them can work and that's fine we don't need all of them to be functioning at the moment so along with that we have enough room for more than likely ships to get in here when they want to trade out because not all of the goods that are going to be sent out from this island are only going to be via airships and each one of them have been named specifically by mr major so i went ahead and did that as well i can't get the one all the back there we go the venti is meant for another island i just i built five just because i need to have something that's fast and i didn't want to use the other ones just yet until i know exactly what to do with them so what we have to do now is we need to get the harbor area actually built up with a whole bunch of people and where in the heck is the harbor city there it is awesome what we're gonna do is we're gonna start off with some base farmer residences and i think this is gonna look pretty nice hopefully it'll work out for us there's our first people over here i'm gonna go ahead and get the streets put up life is so so all right hold up oh now now this is gonna freak me out because i can't put these where is the marketplace there it is here's the marketplace and we are going to swap it to the ornate market there we go that's what we like to see right right now i have to make sure that i get the brick housings which is this one and we're gonna swap all of their skins to the brick housing i think i'm gonna do some beautification work from time to time like over in these little bits and pieces over here but we have to provide them with all their services so like we have the morning at sea and that's gonna be pretty important oh what the heck is this oh no that's for tourism we don't care about that one oh they're power plants here oh yeah yeah okay so that that kind of works i had no idea that was even here cool uh the only issue is do the farmer schools actually have a one at sea oh they do awesome great love to see it let's put this right over here and we're gonna get some more of these homes built up kind of hold them right there and then we should probably put i have to figure out where the heck you know what let me just take this and put it where the docklands is and city institutions probably where the paved streets are just so i can get to them very quickly because now we should be able to get every single one of these fisheries online that's really important i think what i will also do is potentially start bringing in some work clothes or having them mid being made over here is something that wasn't necessarily discussed quite yet but i feel just to err on the side of caution which i normally do i'm going to bring them in from another source and that will allow us to see the harbor area actually at work so there's this ship right and let's see where's a place that has a whole bunch of work clothes that they don't need maybe san sere has them yep that seems to be a decent amount how about we take three instead of the max over to the island here which does indeed have its own section right here but i will probably change its name to make it a little bit better all right what else y'all want so they're getting their fish in that's wonderful uh let's see i think the water the water is gonna have to be something that's built on land so temporarily an explosion in one of your factories oh sweet jesus hey this is great you know what this building is right next to it let me let me just show you it's great it's an effing fire station and that happens no one better tell me that this is anything besides my shit luck guaranteed guaranteed i i will i will die on this hill it is my shit luck it is not the game 100 because i i'm telling you that is the best that i could possibly build and i put it right next to the refinery specifically for them blowing up but you know it just did it legitimately just did i can't do anything else about it you reached a new milestone all right where's the water clean water pump we're gonna put the clean water pump right about i think maybe about here please don't leave your and then the administration is only going to pose a little bit of a problem because the landowners are meant to be like right here and we don't have enough to provide to them quite yet in order for the radius to expand so let's see what other stuff okay so the morning at sea we're gonna have to build that in a moment i think i'll put this one like maybe it's actually really cool but this one like right about here how far is the radius go i mean it was pretty far yeah that's nice should be getting the water in relatively soon and we're getting the work clothes and so that's lovely get a couple more farmers here so we have to get up to 500 farmers and we also need to get up to 500 workers in order to get the farms rebuilt and all that good stuff and make it look really nice i think what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna copy this but then i'm gonna tilt it on its side and bring it like right here and the next one we can probably like hmm what can we put in the middle there well we can pull these guys and put them over here this market should reach all the way back there but we can also have our city institutions being the harbor police we can have the old town pub skin or the old world pub skin excuse me and then we are going to have a church which the church i don't know if i can swap it over on this side to the other skins that i have well actually you know what i feel like this would work i feel like this fits their vibe but i i could be wrong i'll more than likely check it to see what's going on uh harbor hospital is going to be crucial i think i probably would want to put this over here then is this right in the middle as opposed to the other one right yeah this is going to be a better spot for so we'll put the harbor hospital right over here and we're going to get a road that's going to connect these guys because over in the middle here we're going to do some work in a moment and then the police station needs to you know put the police station like right behind the harbor uh what is this thing called marketplace right there i need to change their skins that's really important change all their skins to the brick ones very pretty and we now have 200 and well i mean labor pool is definitely going up but i'm kind of not counting the fact that when do we start again oh yeah they need a warehouse yeah yeah that's that's the thing where is the harbor warehouse where'd that be not in here i probably have passed it multiple times before that's definitely not it wait wait wait big brain idea new albion has it it's right over here i'm gonna yoink it i'm gonna bring it right over here because we're gonna have to probably position it yeah let's let's position one like right here next to the depot or right behind it this one over here we're gonna have to put it maybe here that works so long as i could get to it you know that's the most important thing and let's get some of these and fill this out i'm gonna fill this out and this side now too along with this and this so our total amount of farmers here right now are 386 rising and lush and green we're gonna get some of the horses now and the horses stables are gonna be right over here and we're gonna be expanding upon this for sure so do bear this in mind it's definitely a work in progress we don't have the grain here yet but we're going to be working on that soon because all this island has been mapped out already let me see the steampunk skin on this oh that's so cool that's awesome if only all the cars would have had the steampunk skin with it as well okay now is that enough horses for them right now yeah it is so we're bringing in the clothes we're already producing like 20 fish over here that's that's insane you can even probably swap these out later if we decide to get one of those uh ridiculously powerful power plants going here oh that would be insane oh you know what we need it's really important and i didn't even put this thing down at all let's put down a fire station yeah we'll put it on this side though makes it look a little bit nicer and then getting into beautification stuff we're gonna have to utilize the docklands one here quite a bit i'm just gonna swap it out with this regal standard i know it sounds like heresy but i need the i need the stuff put that there can we fit in some seating areas no but we can probably put in like a lamp uh that's too large just fill that out then i'm happy that i don't see the crates okay let's put one seating there we'll put another one of these over here let's do this let's get a lamp post there a lamp post here where's a little bit of the key let's grab that and pull this actually just do the middle there we go because on the sides we can probably just put down some trees like so and we'll get a little spot to sit and another spot to sit free and tree very nice very pretty looking cool i think what we can do as well is also build a couple of these homes around here too the kingdom of sapon appreciates order order and uniformity so i'm trying to do my best to make sure that's actually happening uh that's the wrong one we have to there we go that's gonna solve that problem right there grabbing a couple more homes i'm gonna put them right about here and change their skins immediately so what are we looking at here we're at 625 rising very cool very cool indeed so we have our first little side right over there situated and we're gonna need a lot of people here that are going to be working like no tomorrow guaranteed so bring in a whole bunch of their other goods and services such as like i don't know the sausages the bread all that stuff we will do this but the only thing that we need to do first is because this is a bread basket region we needed to start working on the farm fields now in the very middle right this area is designated for the vegetable farms that are around the administration building because these vegetable farms will become ridiculously powerful and we do have like pretty much every other one that we can utilize over here actually we do we have the potatoes we have the vegetables we have grain all that good stuff so if we can probably work on the administration a little bit then we can have probably have like total island coverage if we get some landowners in good spots right but this is too far away so that's not going to help them out at all but for the time being we're going to start off with the vegetable farms and vegetable farms are going to start up from like probably here actually you know what we're going to get a small warehouse built up for actually this is a warehouse in it i think that is a warehouse yeah it is totally forgot so let's get the vegetable farm i'll get one started in a basic place like maybe right over here we have the fertilizer silo we also have the plow barn which i think we're gonna need some tools in order to activate right is it tools or is it just yeah so we're gonna have to bring in some tools as well and then the fertilizer silo which is going to be right behind it pretty cool it's going to increase the farm field size so i'm just going to finish them out with a shift tactic just to make it look really cool uh we'll do the same over on this side then get this one to here and get these two built up man i love being able to pre-plant stuff but holy hell i went out of freaking timber and that fantastic love to see it love to see it and i thought i was doing so well already so so well okay that's now 100 and no that's 92 let's get them over here 96 so we have already satisfied one condition being the farmer workforce limit but now we have to work on the workers and getting some more of the farm fields built up it's already starting to look very pretty uh the reason why we ran out of a whole bunch of the timber is because well i mean building all these is going to take a bunch but uh getting these ones too is also going to be a fair amount i'm i'm bringing in one additional resource to the region and uh you see how the fertilizer barn or fertilizer silo is actually working yeah it is because i've been also bringing over some dung from uh new albion yeah yeah it was necessary okay it's definitely necessary can we build this one no we need actually to have them let's see i guess i could pre-plan where the other ones are going to be to start off let's grab this and put it over here i'm gonna just put it in blueprint mode for now and we'll get there the barn and we'll also get this one over here and then do the exact same thing we did on the other side right over here let's see if i can no i don't want to copy it i kind of want to mix it up from time to time you know it shouldn't all look the exact same that's my opinion when it comes to farm fields because even if you go and see the real things right they're not all looking the exact same they all have different layouts based off of the land and i really want to try to stick to that so let's get this road all the way over to here and we'll extend it like this and get the fields positioned around it and i just tuck it in is that max oh my god that was awesome that's gonna look really nice we should have a spot for an imperial trade union here as well where is that other airship you know it has the funniest uh clipping issue over in new albion is it there right now look look at this it's all the way in the freaking building it's hilarious i love it you'll love to see it all right can we fast forward this so we can actually you know get what we need over there where's the ship i thought there was a ship heading over here there is one where it is where where it be oh there you are hi you're just chugging away aren't you well we are going to fast forward this so we can hopefully get that airship over here too in order to continue our build because it's gonna really suck if we just cannot continue without any timber you know i guess i can do this i can probably set another one of the airships for the time being to bring some over lift achieved let's open a trade route menu uh we'll take it from new albion because this is the place that has the most timber right now so just bring a whole bunch over right over to here nice hey mouse you want to work that'd be really fantastic oh fastest thing zooming jesus christ i'm gonna fast forward some more because i want to see this ship it has to go all the way through this and i think it's possible it has the same size as the one that all the hunt has for the most part so i think not the ship itself but the main harbor area entrance etc and the airship is coming in at the same time that's actually a really cool scene oh dude this guy's actually looking at it at the same time it's actually coming in that was perfect timing awesome all right moment of truth and you go in yep awesome you're you're gonna crash into a whole bunch of farming vessel or fishing vessels but nevertheless it worked about all the way to the back okay so what's the deal here the horses are probably not enough then no they are they are indeed enough at least for the one and now we have some more timber in here so the more we build these the more we're gonna actually have to get with the horses and whatnot so the administration is gonna go all the way even if we don't change it up for the most part it's going to be this radius but we can have some of the regular wheat fields over in grain fields over in the back which i'm not opposed to doing in the slightest so i'm going to extend this road i'm going to bring it somewhere to like right here and first thing we're going to have to do is going to put down a warehouse gonna be the most important thing it's gonna be the centerpiece of this whole spot and then head over to the uh workers right and we need to find the brett there it is so the grain farm grain farm is going to be utilizing the steam motors and all that good stuff which is going to require us to build a fuel depot here in a moment so let's go and put this one down we put our love into this i know you do sweaty i know you do and then the tractor barn we can put down immediately i think i'll put it on this side let's have like one little piece and we do indeed have enough steam motors here to last a lifetime so i'm going to put both of these into the stockpile and then move the venti probably over to here let's go ahead and build that up fields might help hey woman all right hold on hold on i actually get a lot more fields than what i anticipated originally like that's 135 as opposed to what it normally is base game which is in the 200s for this but let's go ahead and get the fuel station underway now this is going to require us to have some workers which we will go ahead and upgrade in a moment and we can go ahead and put the fuel station which is going to have a pretty decent radius yeah so far it's like getting everywhere so go ahead and put this thing like right over here i think this is a nice spot for it and now we need 75 workers so we can't have you guys doing anything right now we're gonna go ahead and upgrade a couple of these guys hopefully soon uh the horses horses again okay hold on well i'm bringing in some of the rain now so let's get a horse training ground set up for them and then we're gonna build a whole second set right next to it that's gonna look very pretty and you are already getting overloaded so let's go ahead and put down a small warehouse right here on the other side of the administration building i think we should also have like the occasional police office and police station and fire station which over here we're going to be prioritizing the volunteers we'll have a volunteer fire department right over there we'll also have a volunteer one conveniently positioned right over here when i get more timber in so dumb i'm constantly having this issue where's the other one are you bringing the timber okay you don't need to wait just just go let's go shoot no you don't need to go back you don't need all right go zoom thank you they take forever to load and unload naturally i i get it let's bring that airship over here as quickly as possible because i don't really want to slow down this build whatsoever i need to get workers out here as quickly as possible and i need that fuel station working now so how much oil do we even have in the oil harbor oh just a casual 850 already this thing is ridiculous okay one second oil is crazy and i don't even have the silo built up which i don't even think it would do anything for us unless it provides extra goods every couple cycles but that's entirely up for debate i've never used it before so i'm not entirely certain ready to fly great oh wrong button can you deliver all of that please it's probably not even going to be all of it oh no it is all of it awesome 903 timber is just perfect so build this and let's get some of these guys upgraded this is where we started off at so i'm gonna bring these guys a new milestone and then followed by these guys how much do we have now well we haven't provided them with other things we we can get them up kind of close to the school but that needs 750 of them i need to maintain the happy balance or start working on this side which is totally possible there's even more room over here too if i really want to get these guys upgraded that brings them up to 430 509 how about this wow okay well we got the workers to a good state but we completely screwed the farmers from getting that condition we can we can just get a whole other set built up there we go easy peasy and we'll get two more over here nice let's change their skins out so they're at the right ones so now we have both of those initial conditions objectives what have you completed being 500 farmers and 500 workers on the island which is fantastic and now i can get this thing active stop all right everyone back to it great let's get to work let's get some more of these fields operational because it's going to be very very crucial get the next one over here we're going to build it up like this get the tractor barn it's gonna be looking really awesome once we have the all the tractors running over here yeah let's tuck it in like that that's pretty cool that's the next one uh would be a good measure to upgrade or update this one like maybe twice oh we're getting the fuel in here awesome we'll have a lot of wheat fields that's for sure get this one here actually you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna position a couple of them three like this and then just taking a look see at the drawing here because there's a whole bunch don't want that skin for this one at least for now and then we'll have the roads kind of go in between each one make it look a little bit more natural there we go uh get a little overhang on that one same for you uh you know what do this on to like there imagine if this farmer pisses this farmer's family off they will never be able to provide their harvest oh man that's where my brain goes to it's not like oh look beautiful fields beautiful farmers love to see it no it's going to be like hey you want to you want to piss him off you're not getting your yield out all right let's build these fields to make it look all nice and pretty uh you know what here's this is what we're gonna do i'm gonna get rid of this stuff in the back let's fill out this spot so it looks really nice and then drag it as much as we can there this one on the other hand is going to go along the road link up there and then fill out this spot as much as possible and bring it further forward nice the same over here let's see what we can do yeah okay that's a little bit better i like what it turned into not what it was before very pretty oh you know what interesting opportunity we can probably even get a road going straight through like to about here to continue building some more fields over on this side we should have enough fuel coming from this thing to power all these dude this is going to be ridiculous how much are we even processing right now i i dare say it's a bunch 18 so far and we're consuming one for our um our horses but this is because not all of them still have fuel to them this guy back here is going to be probably my favorite because uh well quite frankly it's in one of the nicest spots i always like building these farms right up against cliff sides like this i didn't think that we would only be having these these farm fields this small let me go ahead and do this i will put one over here and another one right there and you know when it comes to 1800 i really do enjoy building farm fields for some reason it's very relaxing to me so naturally when mr major was talking about you know having a bread basket region i was very very excited already and i know that delta has also proposed a bread basket for new albion which i'm also very excited about get these about here and right there gorgeous dude it's gorgeous up here still more room and i'm gonna exploit it let's do this from here down to about here we're gonna get another warehouse and plop it down as i can already see that horrid icon that i absolutely despise and i don't want it to mess around with it too too much more this this fuel station is in a prime location it's prime i can actually here i'll do this whoa that's a lot okay let's upgrade it to maximum we also have this guy we'll upgrade that a little bit i'm seeing my bricks go down but then i also have these two airships in reserve so i will use them if i need to uh let's get this guy like right about here and this here there's also a reason why i'm starting off with the the rain fields and that is because i know new albion is having issues with um the bread supply and naturally having all of these built up is going to be fantastic to get some over there this is gonna look kind of cool get the road over to this and we'll have the overhang i think i might use the shift tactic here in the event that i oh maybe i don't that's pretty yeah that's ridiculous look at that man you want to talk about like probably the best advertisement for the bright harvest dlc here it is this is this is what you want this is what you get from it and i tell you it is hands down the best dlc of this game you cannot change my mind one can argue that new world rising was very very good okay you have a point but when it comes to this this is just so ridiculously powerful bright harvest will work from the very beginning of the game when you start out the very end even if you forget about it that's what makes it so cool and not only that it has ridiculously awesome ornaments too which you can utilize for farming settlements such as this anyway so it i'm i don't know why i'm doing a walking advertisement but that there's there it is all right let's get the fuel into these guys now i do want to kind of move on to another spot if i can oh i see what the issue was over here i hold on 186 bricks i'm going to make this a double road again because there's going to be a airport later on built up here i want to make sure that i get that spot linked up by a road at least from right now and it's going to be a long straight one over to this spot where the other two airships are just big chilling let's see there's also meant to be a little village up here which i'm not sure if i'm going to be building in this particular episode we're going to be working on this island for a good couple of episodes so let's bear that in mind as well let's see what it looks like with this skin oh i kind of like this one a little bit more i think it works i totally forgot about it swap that around let's get this one too very pretty i'll keep that one as this and this one swap it out uh do it this one yeah that'd look nicer oh i'm always busy duck a few left still don't have any fuel into this one or that one probably because they're still processing or are they delivering uh missing goods still not there you also don't have it i can't potentially build another road down here let's probably go ahead and do that build into the farm fields yeah that's really pretty really pretty i think i will extend this one with the shift tactic just to make it look very pretty over here it's low-key a beautification episode for me so i hope you all don't mind i get a little bit too much with these farm fields from time to time not all the way how about like maybe to about here yeah and there we go looks a lot nicer so now they're getting the fuel hopefully i think it should be delivering yeah so we just needed the road connection up into this spot really nice really nice indeed how much are we making now i'm i'm gonna lose it aren't i 45 oh we can do so much better we can do so much better than this it's insane oh this one doesn't even have the fuel still really crazy thing about this too is fuel stations they're gonna require or they'll process the fuel at 15 seconds of pop right but then the tractor barns process it at five minutes so you're gonna have one fuel station work for quite some time actually so don't ever be worried about the fact that you're running out because guaranteed you won't you won't if you have like one maybe two like let's look at the production right now yeah so like one right now is doing just fine for all those maybe you want a little bit more but in the grand scheme of things this should just work all all the time it doesn't have to be micromanaged too too much that's the beauty of this dlc yeah that one maxed out we need some more bricks so i'm going to guys are clear which what are you bringing you're bringing in the timber uh where are you at are you stuff wait not there are you in here yep ready to fly you're just uh nestled in there how about you get out and then press play airborne and ready to go so you can get over to the island very quickly no you don't have to head back no no no you're good you're good you're good you can go you can go thank you thank you very much really appreciate it we don't need you to just be big chilling over here we need the stuff over there now there's a lot of bricks over here should probably bring another airship you go over here actually no not you well you're already on the way and you're meant for this island anyway so head on over i think what i'd like to do is have a imperial trade union position somewhere in here maybe we can have it be like a administration type office over here which is gonna later on like out of character it's gonna boost these farm fields by a ton if i get the right items into them and some of those items actually do increase the amount of the farm fields and the yields provided from them so that could work very well indeed have this set up over here and then as far as banners are concerned we're gonna have their own banners banners and banners awesome that's sick i need more i need more of these nice day for it yeah it is hell yeah it is i love building cornfields i have to use just regular dirt path for now until the bricks arrive very cool i think one more over on this side will do uh you know what hold on while i like the placement i think this would look a little bit nicer and then in here shift tactic sure hell yeah dude that's hands down one of the best areas i've ever made for grain farming and this i i hate to say it patrick it rivals constantinople's i i'm sorry i gotta say it it really does ready to fly uh you can cut in line you can deliver all this and even some of that and then you can fly away nice a lot of work done i mean we got the basic infrastructure stuff done and this being a huge freaking bread basket it's going to be even better so with that local administration already set up too let's go ahead and pave the roads and we can either continue i spent a lot of time in today's episode working on these farm fields in particular and they're not done yet they can go all the way over to here that's what the plan is actually this area is going to be even more insane but now i'm kind of keen on trying to find some specialists to help us out with making these look even and act even better because right now i mean 20 seconds for some grain is just ridiculous go ahead and upgrade this one once and then we can try to either a expand upon the vegetable farms which we can do i guess that's definitely an idea i'm gonna do that one i suppose uh let's put you like right here please oh interesting idea hold on interesting idea way to tick have the the people celebrate your leadership barn right there we can have the fertilizer be right here you can have a couple like a little patch right there in the front that'll look kind of pretty and then bring it all the way to there very cool the building size is ginormous build the road straight to it and we'll do something like this and i have a idea wait wait wait wait wait a minute hold on i got a better idea put this one here put this one here nice and now the island became a little bit less attractive but now i have to do this do i i may not need to this one is full yield this one is full yield uh you know what head down the slope yeah head down the slope i have an interesting idea to pull here did that screw with this one yeah it did okay hold up i'll fix it no no no damn it i'm gonna get rid of it right this put this one right here okay do not get rid of its farm fields like right here this one on the other hand it's gonna be kind of weird it's positioning so let me get rid of that one piece and put that one piece and put that here one piece great anime by the way and this one oh wait wait wait wait wait this too bring them a little bit further in the front there we go you need a warehouse you do and then from here we can bring the road straight up to them nice build that out fill all this i don't think it's possible regardless of whatever i do 65 yeah yeah that kind of sucks okay you have to get rid of this one that was unfortunate if that would have worked it would have been fantastic but and i could probably toy around with it a little bit more and see what happens but in the grand scheme of things i'm just going to do the shift tactic and get this whole spot to have vegetable farms which then i will get rid of this one because i know there's plenty over here very nice very nice indeed very profitable very powerful farming settlement already how much vegetables are we bringing out from here now because you know we need to make sandwiches we are at 40. very nice okay that's a lot of horses there too 56 grain okay yeah that's uh that's pretty substantial that's pretty substantial indeed we could probably start exporting the grain out and through that grain export we can start up like potentially having some of the flour mills because look these guys are working right now it's not going to be for the whole time yeah see we're almost out of flour uh can we get the electrical flour mill going this is going to be really good if it'll work gonna mess with this but whatever yeah we have a ton of grain over in here so i need to talk to mr major and delta to see if there are any trade agreements currently going on just for myself to be like fully up to speed on this because the great thing about our community is when we have ideas and they're bouncing between people it's really awesome i'm just not told all of them so later on i they're like oh yeah we have this agreement i'm like great awesome so now i can do this for you etc etc that's what i like so if you guys do have ideas and you guys are talking about like trade agreements and such please let me know because i want to definitely be in the loop with all of that thank you very much really appreciate it getting a lot of vegetables out here and there's still even more room to make more of these i think just my favorite spot right now is going to be right over here until this whole spot in the front is going to have a bunch of vineyards you know what for the hell of it i'm building one already i have to do it i'm gonna do it actually one vineyard at least i have to i put this one like right about here i think based off of no wait i'll pull it back a little bit more bring it here i'll have a road go across link it up we're gonna have to have a warehouse too i'm gonna put the warehouse right there i guess tractor barn 192 fields let's go and up to nope i can't do this my bad because i have to have roads go through here really cool and then this skin it's just chef's kiss man it's awesome so once this place also has its fuel we're going to be getting a whole bunch of lovely fantastic grapes from here the administration it probably is in the nicest spot along with the banners for this island it's awesome it's powerful it's going to be ridiculous when it starts exporting its goods out what did you bring a whole bunch of bricks god bless you awesome 950 i love seeing a maxed out brick over here i think uh no albohan does not have it albohan's almost max on everything else except for the bricks which is not receiving any anymore uh unless there are more explosions that is which i do hope is not the case but it wouldn't be a rant this episode without an explosion right explosion random fire i'm jinxing myself i should probably do my outro now because that's really important right yeah yeah absolutely so we got a lot of work done in the grand scheme of things we got the population sorted we got the administration going we have the vegetable farms and a bulk of the wheat or the grain farms also built up so we're going to be building a whole bunch more of those we're going to work on the small village up there in the top in the next episode along with getting more of these farm fields built up over on the right hand side of the island before we head over to the left hand side to get some more of the like for example hops potatoes all that good stuff so we can export and get the bread basket of the kingdom of sapon back to what it used to be and improve our relations with them which is extremely important to me we have to do so i don't want to have enmity with any of the people in the border regions anymore as the new regional power we have to do it and i'm glad to do it so until next time my friends thank you so much please consider like commenting subscribing hitting that bell button sharing it with your friends i really hope you enjoyed today's episode this is going to be a really awesome build set i'm so excited for it and i hope you are too have a great rest of your day my
