Howto & Style
 hey folks Aaron Otto Creek farm and bush hogging services.com out here on another job this weekend opening up some trails and you can see behind me what we have done when we got started it was basically fingertip to fingertip along this trail and the owner wanted it opened up and it's a lot of this Florida scrub that you see behind me and getting it done so it's been about about four hours so far getting through it pretty quick we got the bomb of light today it's the only thing heavy enough to get through some of this and then here's what the bomb of light can do to some of these trees you can see it's basically shaved out in half it's not a mulcher but it'll certainly cut that down and allow you to pick it up and move it and I'm not sure why he ran over that one but he did so I'm going to spin you around and we're going to go back and take a look at the tractor in action with the heavy duty bomb of light on there here we go this job ended up being more work than anticipated had to put a lot of branches on the ground like over here back there came along with the chainsaw each of us took a turn and basically whooped us soaked to the bone from sweat out here in the Florida humidity it's kind of overcast today it rained a little bit ago so it hasn't been too bad but with that humidity it's just hot so about an hour on that chainsaw is about anybody as much as anybody can take here you can see a peek at the bottom of light up there let's take a break we'll be right back all right mosquitoes and horseflies are out today welcome to Florida the rainy season just kicked off watch out he's probably backing up this is the last bit we're done here we got lucky the owner added some work to it we made a couple extra hundred bucks for clearing around the pond gotta be careful not to get near that day nothing will throw a rock up the arse it's kind of like working with a sledgehammer compared to a regular brush cutter we had a tail wheel put on it and it was a fail somewhere along the way it looks like a pin got pulled out the tail wheel fell out he ran over it dented it kind of jacked it up so we'll have to try to repair it later we have to get a new wheel just disappointing i haven't even really used it yet back right into those palmettos it won't mulch a palmetto but it'll it'll cut a palmetto stalk and unless if it's the real fibers piece it won't you won't mulch a pipe otherwise it will do a real number on the palmettos all this scrub boat that you see around here like this stuff the only time it gets difficult is when the branches hang over the field and then they get in the way of the tractor cab which is why we got to go out with a chainsaw ahead of the cutter and cut those particular branches down so we can move efficiently in the tractor we're going to keep this video short if you need bush hogging services in cedar key chiefland bronson williston crystal river areas give us a call at bush hogging services.com if you like the video like like it and give us a thumbs up we appreciate you and hope you enjoyed the videos let's get out of here before we get run over get a piece of wood stuck on our skull
