Howto & Style
 done cleaning up the weld and I could see the crack a little bit better so it goes really from here all the way up to here and then it goes all the way around I'm not the best welder guys but the previous welds were not deep at all and they were basically surface level that's why I didn't hold so hopefully I can do a little bit better let's see so we just got done it's not the best but I'm probably gonna have to come back because middle way through this nice welding event I ran out of gas but we'll paint it up and then want to come back and address it later
