Howto & Style
 Good morning modernsteaders. It's a balmy. 19 degrees out this morning. Gotta love winter. Speaking of winter, we need to prep our chicken coop for winter. Let's get that finished this morning. We're gonna go over to one of the tents and pick out the chicken wire. We'll go get it. I believe and hope I have a roll of chicken wire in here. Yes I do. I'm not super worried about keeping critters out of this part of the chicken run. This will be the chicken run. They'll be in here during the day. So I'm not too concerned about predators during the day. They're gonna be locked up at night in New York City. That's predator proof. So what I want to do today is make it so the chickens stay in and they can't get out. They're going to eat also together. I'll get eat. For me up here in northern New Hampshire, the winter chicken coop is more about function. How do we get the coop to function well and do what we need to do throughout the winter where we don't have to spend a lot of money running electricity for heat lights and for waterers? How do we get the chickens to thrive in the normal conditions without having to baby them? We don't want to have to do that here. There. There. There. I found that the tarps that cover lumber piles at the lumber yard were perfect. They last a while too. They have a white side and a black side. So depending on what purpose you're using it for, you might want to have different sides out. So for one of our chicken tractors that the chickens are in the summertime, we have the white to reflect the sun. This being a winter chicken coop, I'm going to put the black out so it attracts the sun and it should help heat up the greenhouse. Do something else. BWAStop Anna Oh, that's my mistake. I thought this tarp was 16 feet long. Only a 12 footer. Man. Oh well. I'll use it for now. We'll have to get along with that. Well, that's definitely a disappointment. I thought all the tarps I had were 16 feet long. We're going to have to go buy two new ones now. One for the chicken coop and one for the pigs. Not doing that today. We don't have time for that. But let's let the chickens out. Feed them. And let's go give the pigs some more hay. This is going to be fun. I bet who else is going to like this hot water outdoor spigot? It's going to be all the animals this winter. They'll be able to have hot water to drink. I'm going to be able to drink. I like putting the grain right down on top of her where I want the animals to scratch, peck through, and eat. We want them to start turning all this hay for us. So that's why we're feeding them right here. We want to encourage that kind of behavior in our animals. I'm hoping this keeps them in. If it does, we can bring the Icelandic chickens in over to the winter chicken coop. I bet they'll love being able to be in a bigger flock and stay warmer when it gets colder out. We're from here to Success. If you beg you quiet this morning Oh, is Andy going after you? How's the warm water? Let's go give the pig some water and then we'll bring them over some fresh hay. They're still sleeping. Now coming out to this site is never going to get old. Good morning girls. Buried in that hay, staying warm. Yup. Let's bring you in and see if we can show you Paschuto. She's in there somewhere. Oh, there's the other Schnauzer. Good morning. There you are. Oh, good morning. There you are. Oh, good morning. You look like happy pigs. Yup. You want some nice warm water? Yeah. Then I'll bring you some more hay. Took me a second to find their dish. I was hoping it wasn't back in the tote. You look like happy pigs. Yep. You want some nice warm water? Yeah. Then I'll bring you some more hay. Took me a second to find their dish. I was hoping it wasn't back in the tote. Alright Copa, let's get some nice warm water out here for them. They're a lot more friendly now. Huh Copa? Getting to know us already. Don't worry Prosciutto, you don't need to get up. I'm going to go get the hay. Stay here and keep an eye on the pigs for me. I'm going to go get the hay. I'm going to go get the hay. I'm going to go get the hay. I'm going to go get the hay. Blowing bubbles over there. Typical kids. Give you some fresh hay. More bedding and some more food. Yeah. And then I'm going to go get the hay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We are here. You've got to go get half of the hog. Yep. You gonna come say hello? Don't play with the camera. Well, I wasn't able to get everything done that I wanted to. That's alright. It was still a good day. The pigs are settling in nicely. All the animals are doing great in the cold weather. We're getting used to it too. We're enjoying the nice fresh smoked bacon we have in the house. All the great food we put up throughout the season. Now we get to sit back and enjoy that and just have fun. Thankful for the year. Great pigs. And we're looking forward to the future.
