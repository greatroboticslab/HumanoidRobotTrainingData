Howto & Style
 Hey everyone, today we're planting garlic. I'll be using both store-bought garlic and 12 cloves of elephant garlic from this year's harvest. We'll be planting them in two different types of garden beds. One is a no-dig bed and the other is hugelkultur. We're going to compare which method works better. So what's the difference? No-dig gardening is exactly what it sounds like. No digging. Instead, we layer compost and organic materials on top of the soil to build it up naturally, protecting the soil structure. On the other hand, hugelkultur is a raised bed technique that uses decaying wood and organic matter as the core of the bed. The word hugelkultur comes from German and means mound culture. This technique helps retain moisture and adds nutrients over time as the organic materials break down. I'm planting the garlic on September 28th, 2024. Sewing each clove about 4 inches deep and spacing them roughly 7 inches apart. Normally, I'd water them in after planting, but today the ground is already quite wet, so I'll just rake over the soil and leave it as is. Now it's just a waiting game to see how these two different methods perform. Will the no-dig bed do better, or will the hugelkultur bed come out on top? Only time will tell.
