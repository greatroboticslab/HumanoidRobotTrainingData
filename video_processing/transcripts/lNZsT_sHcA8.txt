 Welcome back to Modern Agri Machines. Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of onion farming. From planting to harvest, and finally to processing, let's see how onions make their way from the field to your plate. Let's get started. Onions are grown worldwide with the largest producers being China, India, and the United States. These countries cultivate millions of tons annually, providing a massive contribution to the global economy. Not only are onions crucial for flavor and cooking, but they are also packed with essential nutrients like vitamins B and C. In fact, onions bring immense economic value to farmers, generating billions in revenue. They're also a nutritional powerhouse known to reduce the risk of heart disease and improve immune function. The process of growing onions begins with selecting seeds, nurturing seedlings, and taking care of young plants before they are transplanted into the fields for large-scale cultivation. The seeds need to be treated to enhance their germination rate and resistance to pests. Before sowing, the seeds are typically soaked in warm water for 12 to 24 hours to stimulate germination. After treatment, the seeds are sown in seed trays or directly into nursery soil. Onions grow best in loose, well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter. After preparing the soil, farmers plant the seeds or onion bulbs in carefully arranged rows. Watering is a crucial factor for healthy onion growth. Drip irrigation is commonly used to conserve water and ensure optimal plant development. Once onions are growing, they need constant care. Farmers regularly weed the fields to prevent competition for nutrients and use organic fertilizers to enhance growth. Onions are also vulnerable to pests like onion thrips and diseases such as downy mildew. Many farmers adopt organic or chemical-free pest control methods to ensure healthy, safe crops. After 90 to 150 days, onions reach maturity. When the tops of the onions fall over, it's time to harvest. Farmers carefully pull or lift onions from the ground to prevent damage. In smaller farms, harvesting is done by hand, but for larger operations, specialized machines make the process quicker and more efficient.
