Science & Technology
 Thanks to the government's strong promotion of smart agriculture, the intelligent agriculture production platform based on IoT, cloud, AI, and other emerging technologies is becoming increasingly mature. Based on AI plus IoT technology, our solution can connect environmental factors, monitor crop status, and generate an intelligent irrigation schedule supported by an expert decision system. The solution helps achieve precise volume control for agricultural irrigation, enable the best growing environment for crops, reduce irrigation costs, integrate field monitoring capabilities, and improve field management and services. The solution can collect environmental and crop information through monitoring devices and sensors. On this basis, the Decisioning module can generate an intelligent irrigation program. The intelligent water-saving irrigation system is a typical use case of AI in agriculture. The deployment of AI technology along the agricultural value chain unlocks broader value in precision agriculture.
