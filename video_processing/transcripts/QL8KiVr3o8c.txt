Nonprofits & Activism
 The Custadia Agraria, which is the Menorca's land stewardship program, is based on an agreement on sustainable agricultural practices. On the one side of the agreement, the farms commit to adopting a series of agricultural practices that benefit the environment. On the other side, in recognition of this commitment that benefits society as a whole, Gov Menorca helps these farms through different ways. One way is taking action on farms by providing services and materials. Ultimately, what is sought is to help and accompany the farmer in their journey towards sustainable agriculture production. It is a way of giving a final push to make the changes they want, but for one reason or another they are unable to. Be it due to economic reasons or lack of time. We take action in many areas in relation to the farm, but we could group them into five main blocks. The first block is improving soil fertility. Soil fertility is the basis of soil productivity and has huge repercussions in relation to the farm's economic viability. In this area we provide soil analysis, soil management recommendations and we also accompany the farmers in implementing new directed grazing practices and the materials needed for this. The second block is improving water management practices. In this case we aim to reduce as much as possible the extraction of fresh water from the aquifer because it is overexploited. We also want to help maintain humidity in the soil to improve soil fertility. What we do essentially is to restore rainwater harvesting systems that are no longer working or are abandoned. For example, traditional canal systems or traditional systems called algeops. And then we innovate them with solar power pumps. Also, we aid soil water retention through key line landscaping techniques. Rainwater canals and swales are installing covers to protect from the sun and heat. We have a third block of action which is focused on biodiversity conservation. So as an environmental organization we have an intrinsic interest in conservation. But there's also numerous benefits for farmers too such as increased crop resilience and biological pest control. In this case we carry out annual bio indicator monitoring of certain species and this is done through a citizen science project. And it's carried out by volunteers. We also create water sources for wildlife and install nesting boxes to encourage natural predators. And these control pests and diseases on the farm. The fourth block of action is linked to habitat conservation. For example, we carry out a natural value inventory of each farm. And this helps us detect areas to act upon and it helps us better understand the land that we are protecting. Then what we do is collaborate in habitat maintenance and restoration actions. So especially for forested areas, these are of interest so that cattle can refuge from the heat and also wild pasture lands. Because these offer quality food for livestock at a near zero cost. While they're also catalogued as priority habitats at a European level. And we generally carry out this work through volunteering sessions that are run one Sunday a month. Finally, the fifth block consists of restoring landscapes. So the mosaic landscape is characteristic of Menorca and includes a patchwork of dry stone walls, fields and forested areas. This landscape also includes ethnological elements that are important parts of the island's identity. And at the end of the day, this is what we all see in our surroundings and we think this is really important. So we offer waste removal services for farms. We install traditional wild olive tree gates. We also help restore structures that are made from traditional dry stone walls that help protect fruit trees within pasture lands. This would be a summary of ways in which we take action and invest in the farms that are part of Custodía Agraria. But we also carry out other activities such as product promotion, training and consulting and working with the general public through volunteering and environmental education. And we will explain these in the other videos. Thank you. Thank you.
