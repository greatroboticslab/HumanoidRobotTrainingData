 Hi, I'm Beau Broadbeck, Extension Specialist in Community Forestry and Arboriculture with the Alabama Cooperative Extension System. Today we're going to review some basic chainsaw safety considerations from ensuring your saw is in working order to wearing the proper safety gear. While many of us own chainsaws and enjoy their efficiency for cutting firewood or removing debris after storms, it's easy to forget that if improperly operated, they can be extremely dangerous and even life-threatening. Begin by making sure all the safety features on your saw are present and in good working order. Second, make sure your saw is well maintained. Ensure that the chain is sharp, dull chains decrease cutting efficiency, and make operators work harder. Check that the bar oil reservoir is filled with manufacturer recommended oil. No motor oil, please. Finally, check that the fuel mixture is to manufacturer specifications, usually a 50 to 1 ratio. Just ensure you are wearing the following personal protective equipment, or PPE, as it could very well save your life. Wear sturdy boots and chainsaw chaps. More than 40% of injuries occur on the left leg or foot. This alone could prevent an injury. Also, make sure to wear a hard hat to protect your head from falling objects that might be dislodged from the trees you are working on. Don't forget your hearing protection. Chainsaws are loud and we want to be able to hear our children or grandchildren. Put on your safety glasses. Chainsaws kick up debris that can easily scratch your eyes and damage your vision. Finally, gloves are highly recommended and should always be worn when sharpening the chainsaw.
