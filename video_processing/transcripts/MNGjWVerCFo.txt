 This is sweet potatoes that we had just planted. Okay. We planted some of them a week ago, and then the ones that are being irrigated now, we planted yesterday. Okay. And it's very important if you don't get rain after you're planting, if you don't have irrigation, it makes it real difficult for the plants to get established after you plant them. So this is a plant. See how far you get a dig, Bill? Before you get any moisture. Not even hitting it yet. So that rain is really critical right now. Very critical. So, some people go to Las Vegas to gamble and you choose to farm, I guess, huh? That's exactly right. Wow, so here's the potatoes that we get at the farmers market. Nice. Tell me a little bit about what you've done here since the last time I was out here. Actually, all we've had to do is cultivate them several times. Okay. And that's to get the weeds out, and along with getting the weeds out, it pulls the runners from the sweet potatoes so they don't set down. Okay. And it gives you a better set under the hill. Okay. So there's two benefits to cultivating, getting the weeds out along with pulling the runners back in so they don't, if you get a lot of runners that set down, then it takes size away from the sweet potatoes. So this is called a potato harvester? That's a potato harvester. And how does it work? It just, it runs on hydraulic. Okay. Rather than PTO, it's got a hydraulic pump. And does it have, does it go down and dig or? Yeah, you just set it whatever depth you want. Okay. And with sweet potatoes, as you see, once we get digging, we have to go rather deep with it. Okay. Alright. So, we're going to get to the end up. So, supposedly with ourji Round which comes from to PTO to the T Dog because it looks so beautiful in this happy sculpture and with it, and I'll give you a nice. TheHerealy pension phase is a fairly good part that ends up today. That's good. Now, we'll get to Paris 3 honored for these innovations. Nice to meet you round up.

You do this all by hand. Oh, yes. Okay. So these are all sweet potatoes. Yes. And then where will these go? They'll go into that storing trailer behind the shed. Okay. And this is just how they're stored. Right. Right. Don't store them. Cure them and then store them for the winter. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's what it says.
