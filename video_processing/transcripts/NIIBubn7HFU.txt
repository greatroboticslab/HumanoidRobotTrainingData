 Go Ke He YosLER at the me I'm a psychopath. I'm a father. I'm a psychopath. I'm a psychopath. I'm a psychopath. You're a psychopath. You're a psychopath. I'm going to cut my nine. I'm going to cut my nine. I'm going to cut my nine. We're out in a field in North Carolina in September. Another beautiful harvest day here in Hampton Farms, Peanut Country. We're going to catch the tractor as it comes by and then I'm going to step in behind it. That's our Virginia type peanuts that we grow at Hampton Farms for end shells, the best end shell peanuts around. We had a great growing season this year. So let's watch the tractor come by. As you can see, these peanuts grow under the ground and what our farmer is doing right now is what's called a peanut digger. They dig them up out of the ground and it inverts them, throws them up to the sunlight for two or three days where they do some field drying. And in about 72 hours they'll probably be in here with the peanut combine and pick the pods off the vines and put it into a drying trailer. This is absolutely a beautiful crop here. Do movable. Stop this. hat. Bye.
