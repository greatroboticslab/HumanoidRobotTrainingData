 I got my bong packed, I got tea, I got three different beverages. Alright, I'm ready to go. Sup guys, it's Zee here again to show you my Organibus Grow. In this episode, I'll be showing you guys how I converted my organic living soil into a no-till method. I'll give you guys a recipe for reamending my 15-gallon pots at the end of harvest, as well as a conversion for 5 and 10-gallon pots. I started my soil with a half and half mix of Fox Farm Ocean Forest, as well as their Happy Frog as a base. Then I mostly amend with down-to-earth dry amendments, and the microbial life added from my already existing 5-year-old outdoor compost pile. If you already have your living soil started and you just harvested your plants, or soon will be, this video is perfect for you, so you can begin implementing the no-till method. If you haven't started your own super soil yet, you can see how I started mine in a video on my page. It should show up in the corner right now. In there, you'll find a lot of info about starting a living soil, minus the worms and cover crop. But I also go over many of the same ingredients in this top dressing recipe, as well as their uses more in-depth in that video, so you might find something interesting, even if you already have a living soil started. You could also get some great pre-made mixes out there, and they are a great option, especially when getting started. But I like the more hands-on approach, so I know exactly every little thing that goes into my soil. Knowing, knowing what goes in, knowing exactly what goes into the mix, not only makes me feel more in touch with my soil, it gives me the ability not to rely on one product if there's a shortage, such as the oyster shell shortage we are currently facing, as I can always supplement ingredients with similar alternatives, such as using limestone powder instead of oyster shell. Both are primarily made of calcium carbonate. If you do go with a pre-made mix to start your soil, be sure to go over the ingredients and compare it to others, as well as perhaps this recipe to see if it has all its bases covered. This top dressing recipe is basically the same recipe that I use to recycle my soil after emptying my smaller pots into 30 gallon containers to mix them. This keeps a lot of the great bacteria alive and works great in smaller spaces, and you will get similar results to no-till with more turps in taste than hydro or cocoa, but recycling the soil this way disrupts the mycelium of the beneficial fungi. Mixing or tilling your soil in a container breaks up the mycelium network, and although it can regrow and the decomposing fungi will probably do fine, the mycorrhizae will never be able to reach its full potential unless it's always in contact with living roots, which is where one of the big benefits of cover cropping comes into play. By allowing the soil to sit in its container and adding worms directly to it, they work along with bacterial and fungal networks to break down the nutrients, oxygenate the soil, and create a many thriving ecosystem. Over time, and with many grows, your soil will just become even more rich, and with different types of life and worms working different layers of the soil, not only will nutrients break down to simpler forms more readily available to your plants, the network of mycorrhizae you kept alive on your cover crop will almost immediately attach to any transplanted wheat plants, kick-starting this symbiotic relationship with the life in the soil and helping them gather the nutrients they need more readily. Keeping the mycorrhizae alive also naturally lessens the shock and transition time of transplanting without having to add any extra product aside from clean water. The best way to do it would be to combine them together first, but I didn't want to do everything 10 times, so I poured the ingredients into each pot one ingredient at a time and therefore I listed them in order from stinkiest to least stinky, so at least you'll be covering up the smelliest stuff with more dry material and plant matter. The soil may give off some fresh orders for the first couple weeks of decomposition, but this is only natural. Just be sure you have plenty of ventilation to maintain an aeroping environment. I leave the floor fans on a low setting to keep things moving, and my intake fan is set to half speed, and my 8 inch outtake fan that I normally have set to only run under specific temp and humidity parameters is now set to a constant 2 since I'm just trying to keep air moving. Two exciting ingredients I didn't previously include in my soil that I've recently added to my roster include crab meal and langbanite. How do I say langbanite? Langbanite? Langbanite. Crab meal provides nitrogen and magnesium and is also a source of calcium, but I wouldn't replace my other calcium options with crab meal alone. Its benefits go a lot farther than calcium though. Amongst the many micronutrients it contains, crab meal's biggest secret is a component called chitin. Chitin. I don't know how to say this either. Chitin. Spelled C-H-I-T-I-N. So, chitin. Amongst the many micronutrients it contains, crab meal's biggest secret is a component called chitin. Chitin is a proven deterrent of fungus gnats, bad nematodes, and other harmful pests such as ants and grubs because these are all chitin based in structure. The enzymes that break down chitin are also produced by the cannabis plant as a defense mechanism stimulating the plant's immune system and they have been known to improve the terpene cannabinoid profile even further. Along with the benefits of chitin, the high protein content in the crab meal provides the building blocks for better terpenes and cannabinoids as well. Langbanite, otherwise known by its chemical makeup of Solpomag, is exactly that. It's a mineral deposit composed of 22% sulfur, 22% potash, and 11% magnesium blended together so it's a well-balanced additive that doesn't change the pH. Langbanite adds magnesium while also providing a sulfur and potash boost for danker flowers. Langbanite is similar to epsom salt but without the salts and langbanite is more slow release. I used to use epsom salt directly in my soil but after further research I found that it's more easily dissolved in water so it's best used in teas or only as a top dressing if you need to add a more readily available magnesium source to the plant in response to a deficiency. Langbanite is a superior option and if added earlier in the grow you may avoid the need for epsom salt altogether and add a great clean sulfur source that doesn't adjust the pH as some other sulfur fertilizers do. Adding both these ingredients will be a great addition to improve my flower's flavor even further and it will improve the health of both the soil and the plants. Now it would probably be best to mix all these ingredients together in a separate container before applying but I have decided to try and go directly into the pot with each ingredient only mixing the water I added and allowing the mycelium and worms to do the rest. As you can see within three days the mycelium has already started latching onto the top dressing and breaking it down. I brushed some aside and the red wiggler worms were very active too pulling the material down into the top layer of soil where they do most of their bidding. This process takes two to three weeks or more before you want to replant so it's best to do this immediately after harvest. The longer the better. I then watered them some more and by day five the fungal colonies had fully integrated into the fresh nutrients. The best case scenario would be to have two sets of pots so you can allow the old roots to fully break down before you plant seeds directly into the pot but I utilize a three-stage grow so I can cycle my plants and harvest every three to four months. So after only three weeks old the plants might not fully be decomposed and you might have to cut out the center root if you intend to transplant into the pots within three weeks as my cycle is set up. The way my cycle is set up I already have veg plants anxious to get in the flowering tent by harvest but three weeks is still long enough that the soil should have cooled down and you shouldn't burn your plants if you transplant now. I'll just add what's left of the center roots to my outdoor compost bin and any soil I remove will go into my 30 gallon containers to cook up for my vegging plants as I'm still recycling some soil the old-fashioned way from my veg plants. I will soon be adding night crawlers to work the deeper layers of the soil and they are also the ultimate step to taking the fresh broken down material from the composting worms into yet again even simpler forms. We're trying to replicate a redwood forest here and although we'll never get fully there the closer we can get the better the soil and ultimately your harvest will be. Now after each cycle I'll re-amend the pots just like this however after this grow ideally I'll send in some soil samples from each pot. Since every plant has different requirements each pot will have slightly different needs for re-amending and I'll have to adjust each pot slightly different according to the results. This again plays into why I like mixing my own top dressings myself rather than buying pre-made mixes because that makes it impossible to fine-tune the different requirements for each better pot. For many this may not matter but for me I'm not trying to just hope and wonder why some plants or pots are doing better than others. Although I could wait to read the deficiencies in the plant it'd be better to implement the preventative measure of testing the soil before the grow rather than repairing it later and letting the plant suffer. I have a very brief video about cover crop on my page already but I'll be coming out with an updated version soon. If you guys have any questions be sure to ask them down below and I'll get to them as soon as I can. Until next time stay up buds. Click on the link to at the end. Thank you.
