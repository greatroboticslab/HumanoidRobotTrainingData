 One of my first collections that I did in my current job, farming, sustainable farming and farming practices. Chickens had this many eggs today, and I went into the alfalfa fields and for two and a half hours and then I ate pork. And I was like, this is wow. This is like the dullest thing. But it was really interesting if you took it as an aggregate, you could see the whole perspective and you could see how farmers in the area operated, what they prioritized, what they did for social functions. What their political views were, what their social views were, all sorts of things.
