 Productive and efficient agri-food systems provide us with food that nourishes us and livelihoods that support our communities. Nevertheless, agri-food systems are not performing as efficiently as they should. More than 3 billion people around the world lack access to healthy diets. 690 million suffer from hunger, while 2 billion consume low-quality diets, leading to micronutrient deficiencies and higher levels of obesity. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to food systems already affected by other stressors such as transboundary pests and diseases, natural disasters, conflict and climate change. Transformation of agri-food systems can help transition them to better deliver safe, affordable and healthy diets to the world's rapidly growing population. At the same time, improvements must contribute to inclusive economic and social development. Innovation is a central driving force for transforming agri-food systems. Digital technologies are one example of innovation. Digital agri-food systems innovation includes online platforms, precision agriculture based on sensors, geodata and artificial intelligence, e-extension, e-commerce and digital technologies for rural finance. Additional examples are blockchain and food sensing technologies delivering transparency, traceability, food safety and quality along the food value chains. Most of these solutions are generated by the private sector. Currently, adoption of these innovative approaches by small and poor producers is still significantly hampered by the digital divide. Public investments in rural connectivity, digital literacy, farmer registration in digital database and adequate policy and incentive frameworks are needed to bridge the divide and allow for more widespread global adoption of digital agriculture transformation. But it is not only about technology. Innovation is all about solving complex problems and adding value in new ways. Farmers, herders, foresters and fisher folks are at the centre of innovation. As custodians of natural resources, they have always innovated to find new solutions to complex issues. Inclusive business models such as contract farming allow producers better access to markets and are more stable. and a more stable income. Adoption of geographic indicators labels for food products generate improved market position and incomes. And recent online agriculture worker platforms help meet supply and demands during COVID-19. But all these innovations must ensure access to rural communities in developing countries, especially women and youth. Women are key players throughout all stages of agri-food systems transformation. Likewise, youth are poised to make a major contribution to this transformation by applying their education, entrepreneurial potential and technological savviness to support innovation and shepherding adoption of innovative solutions within their communities. Public-private partnerships will be crucial to help bridge investment gaps in infrastructure and access to facilitate smallholders' participation in the digital economy. Pilot public-private innovation projects targeting developing countries' farmers are promising. The EZOKO Digital and E-Commerce platform connects over 1 million farmers in 10 African countries to essential services, resulting in a 10 to 12% increase in revenues for those farmers. SMS services disseminating key market information to farmers in Peru helped bolster prices for their products by 13 to 14%. The response measures to COVID-19 can also serve as important catalysts for innovation, accelerating the transformation of food systems towards more inclusiveness and sustainability, and fostering employment opportunities and access to healthy diets for the world's most vulnerable.
