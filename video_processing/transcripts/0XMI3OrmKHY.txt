 Flag drippers. Those funny little emitters that sort of stand up and wave, hi. What's the point of those? Alfred Castillo here, the Sprinkler Warehouse Pro. Let's talk flag drippers. Flag drippers are non-pressure compensating, which is a bit of a misnomer. All emitters are somewhat pressure compensating. What non-pressure compensating generally means is that you shouldn't use it on a slope of, say, 5 feet or more. No slope? Save your money and buy non-pressure compensating emitters, such as flag emitters, because pressure compensating emitters cost more. Of course, other than their price tag, there's no real downside to using pressure compensating. Back to flags. This little thing on top is used to disassemble the flag, so you can clean it out should it become clogged, which can happen especially if there's a lot of minerals in the water. Despite their resemblance of little inline valves, turning the flag on top does not regulate water flow. The flags are often color-coded depending on gallons per hour. The colors of the ones I'm using today are black for one gallon, green for two, and red for four. That may change depending on the manufacturer. Often flag emitters are rated in liters per hour. In that case, just remember that there are roughly four liters to the gallon. Flag emitters are perfect for a low-pressure system, like a gravity-fed system where some other emitters may not work so well. Let's install some in our system. We can install it directly on our main line, like this. Or we can run some microtubing, like this, and install it where it's needed. A stake will help direct the water where we want it. If you do install it this way, remember this piece of microtubing is now regulated by this flag emitter. In this case, it's two gallons per hour. You don't want to install another emitter on the end of this because you've already regulated the pressure back here. You can also attach microtubing to the barb, like this.
