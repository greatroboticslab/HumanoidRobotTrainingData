 We're not looking at our operation on a one-year basis. I think unfortunately that's what happens to a lot of producers sometimes is they get so focused on well maybe for a year or two we're going to have corn prices that are eight dollars but then what happens when the prices go down again or what happens when there's a severe drought and that land is not producing a good crop. I really think that it's our job as producers to make sure that we're looking at the big picture that we're not just looking at a snapshot in time. We need to think about what's sustainable in the long haul.
