 Music When people come to the Extension office asking about pesticides, they often times have questions about the effectiveness or availability of organic pesticide options. Now there are many options available that are considered or labeled as organic and are certified for organic production. So despite the fact that a product may be labeled as organic, it's still important that we take the proper precautions and use the appropriate PPE or personal protective equipment. And this means at a minimum we should have long sleeve shirt, long pants, shoes, socks, chemical resistant gloves, and preferably eye protection as well. It's also important to remember that these products can also be toxic to beneficial insects such as our pollinators if used incorrectly. So it's still very important that we open the label, take the time to read it, and familiarize yourself with the product and understand how to safely use that product. Due to a limited availability, there's not always going to be an organic option for every pest. So you may have to get creative or look at other control measures in some cases. So even if a product is listed as organic, it's still important that when using that product that we take the proper precautions and treat that as a chemical.
