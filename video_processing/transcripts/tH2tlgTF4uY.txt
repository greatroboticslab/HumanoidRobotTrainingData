 Good morning guys, welcome back to the farm. In today's video we're going to be up potting some of these beautiful cherry tomatoes, well snacking tomatoes, I call them snacking tomatoes. Anyway, we're going to be up potting some of these cherry tomatoes and I'm going to give you three tips that's going to make your tomatoes double in size in less than a week. So stick around. Welcome back guys. The variety that we're working with today is called Mountain Magic and I call them snacking tomatoes simply because they are actually bigger than your average cherry tomato. Now we grow sun golds, we grow super sweet 100s, and we grow black cherry tomatoes here on our farm and we grow a Mountain Magic. Now this tomato here will get almost the size of a golf ball. It's smaller than your regular slicing tomato but it's bigger than your average cherry tomato. And this variety is very popular in the markets that we attend and we try to grow these several succession plants throughout the year to make sure we got it on hand throughout all of our markets. And these tomatoes just like every tomato that we grow we start them in smaller trays so we can start more of them number wise and then we up pot them to a bigger container so they can actually get a better root base before we put them in the ground. And there's no really script on how we start our tomatoes. It just depends on what trays we've got on hand at the time. This is a 50 cell flat and this is basically a strawberry flat is all it is. And we started these guys in this because I had 100 seeds and that equaled two trays. Now we do start a lot of our seeds in 512s and you can see this we have to be real careful with this tray here because it'll dry out really fast if you're not careful and they will get root bound also if you're not careful. So you have to pay real close attention to these guys and you know up pot them when you think that they are ready. But yeah these guys here are about a week away from needing to be up poted. Some of them have their true leaves on them but a lot of them are still in the cotyledon stage and you can see there's a lot of tomatoes in here. I think I got five or six of these trays that I've got to up pot here in the next week or two. So I'm going to go through and I'm going to show you the process that I use to up pot all of our tomatoes. Not just cherries, determinants, indeterminants, heirlooms. All of our tomatoes are up poted the same way and we generally up pot all of our tomatoes. Now to get away from having to up pot you need to start it in a bigger container and we don't simply for the reason that we don't have the room to do that. We don't have the room to store a lot of these at one time. Like I said in any given time there's three or four thousand tomato plants sitting around here all the time. There's three thousand in my germination chamber and there's another two thousand down here at the back of this high tunnel sitting on the ground. So we don't have a lot of room to do that so that's why we start them in smaller trays. So that brings me to tip number one. Give yourself plenty of room to grow your transplants out. If you can't get around to putting them in the ground at the time that you think you will then they need to be able to stay in whatever you're up potting them in. Now I like to use these egg glue cups because they're cheap one and two that I can reuse them every year simply just wash them out stack them up and put them on the shelf and next year I can do the same thing. Now this works for peppers this works for eggplant this works for just about everything that you want to up pot. There's no real I mean I need to use these or I've got a lot of these trays here these little two inch cups sitting around and you know just something to hold soil more than what is sitting in now. That's really all you're looking for. So the whole purpose of this video is to show you how we up pot these small tomato plants and you can see I've got one that I pulled out in these these small tomato plants that look like this that were grown in these trays and make them look like this that was grown in the same tray it just hadn't been up potted yet and you know we could leave these guys in here and they would get this size here and we could transplant straight out into the garden but that's not you generally how we do things these guys here are going in this high tool and we will be transplanting these out here really soon probably here in the next two or three days but these guys will have to actually sit out for a while before we can put them in the other high tunnel that we're working on now. So tip number one give yourself enough room to have a cushion in order that you don't get in a bind and have to up pot them again. Give them enough room that they can grow in here and these plants they'll get that tall inside of this container here a foot or more and you know you'll still be in good shape because you've got a lot more soil in here and you can actually fertilize these guys while they're in this cup. All right so the second tip I'm going to give you is that we are going to use the same growing medium that we started these tomatoes in. This is the same soil. It's sterile there's no amendments or anything whatsoever in this soil. We're actually going to take two scoops of this and we're going to put in a five gallon bucket and there's no real accurate measurement of this but I take two of those scoops and you can see and I take a four ounce scoop of garden tone and you guys know I swear by garden tone and if you don't know what garden tone is I'll put a picture of it over here so you can see it and you can get it tracked supply you can get it low you can get it at Walmart sometimes but I'm going to take a four ounce scoop a level scoop and I'm going to put in that bucket with those two scoops of soil and then I'm going to just take my hands I'm going to work that in and mix it up really good and what this is is our pre-plant fertilizer and if you followed our channel enough you know that I preach that you need to put down pre-plant fertilizer when you can for plants that are heavy feeders like tomatoes like cabbage like collars all these good vegetables they need a pre-plant fertilizer something that is not already available in your garden give these guys what they need to get a good start. So now we have amended our up pot mixture which is the same mixture it was starting in except for it didn't have any amendments in it our seed starting media is sterile guys we don't use any kind of amendments any kind of fertilizer in our seed starting media and be careful what you're hearing out there different videos I'm hearing a lot of guys that's telling people to actually mix fertilizer in their seed start media and you need to be careful with that you know there's a lot of good farmers out there there's a lot of guys that have some good content on YouTube but be careful what you're watching out there because there's a lot of stuff out there that can get you in a bind if you're not careful my advice to you is use a sterile seed starting mix and I use black gold I get mine at Tractor Supply it's OMRI listed I mean it's organic most peat moss is organic but basically it is sterile and this is what it looks like made by sun gold that's it that's what I use and you can see it's OMRI listed so it's organic we can use it here on our farm no amendments no fertilizers no nothing we put it in there each plant each seed has enough energy to get itself to its first set of true leaves period just naturally it can do that once it gets to this stage is when you need to give it something to feed on that's what we did in this bucket so the recap give your plant something big enough to get a good root base in and use a pre-plant fertilizer when you up pot them not at planting a seed when you up pot it and now we're going to talk about the last step which is to feed your plants once they're established now whenever you up pot a tomato plant pepper plant whatever you're going to have some level of transplant shock that means that plant is just basically going to stall and it's going to establish itself get its roots going back in the you know into the soil trying to run out and find its place in there to basically get established before it starts growing again now um you know all plants do it some do it less than others it just depends on the conditions but once your plant is established and you can tell that it's out of that shock stage you can start feeding it with a either a balanced fertilizer or in our case in tomatoes we want to put on some foliage and get the stalks of this plant a little thicker so once we plant it you don't see them just drooping over like this they come flimsy they look leggy we want plants that are rigid see i can wiggle this thing and see how rigid that plant is that's what i like i like tomato plants to have a backbone to them and to do that before you get blooms on your plant what you want to use is a higher nitrogen fertilizer and in our case since we do plant or fertilize organically we use a chilean nitrate which is what is in this bag here it's a 1502 it is omri listed it is organic you can see right here but it is a natural form of nitrogen that your plant can utilize immediately it doesn't have to wait for the soil to break it down your plants can use this now and what we do is basically give our tomato plants a bath in this stuff we sit it in those totes out there what i use is a tablespoon and a half that scoop right there and five gallons of water don't overdo it so once these plants are young like they are we take these things and we spoon feed them to get them to look like this so to start with we're going to take this plant and we're going to water it nothing in the water just water plain well water we're going to water this plant and let it get established once we can tell that this plant is actually trying it's trying to grow then that's when we're going to utilize the nitrogen the organic nitrogen that's when we're going to utilize this stuff here in our totes and bottom water these guys and these plants will explode they will literally double in size in a week i promise you all right guys so i got to get busy but check back in with us later this week we're going to be up potting these guys here all of the heirloom tomatoes that we started in trays a couple of weeks ago and if you missed that video i'll put a link to it up here and if you found anything useful anything entertaining or just plain old interesting click this subscribe button over here in this right hand corner and as always guys we appreciate you stopping my thank you for your support and we'll see you in the next one
