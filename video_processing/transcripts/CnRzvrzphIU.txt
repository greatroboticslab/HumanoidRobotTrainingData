Science & Technology
 Worldwide revenue from the agriculture drone market is estimated at 4.98 billion US dollars in 2024 and is evaluated to increase at a CAGR of 14.1% to reach 18.64 billion US dollars by the end of 2034. Growing use of drones to obtain information about crop output. Drones used in forestry and agriculture have made it easier for farmers to gather crucial information for making informed decisions about crop output, which in turn helps to boost profitability. Farmers may now obtain information about current issues by using the data that these drones provide, eliminating the need for them to physically examine their crops in the fields. Farmers expect fast charging technologies to address these problems, as current drone batteries typically last only 30 to 35 minutes in the air and require 60 to 90 minutes to recharge. Precision farming depends significantly on field surveying and the accurate processing of data collected by drones. The market in South Korea is forecasted to expand at a CAGR of 14.3% from 2024 to 2034. Use of drones or unmanned aerial vehicles for crop protection in China has been increasing at a significant pace in recent years.
