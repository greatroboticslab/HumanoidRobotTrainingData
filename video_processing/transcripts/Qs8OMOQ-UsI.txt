 Let's do something special. Turn on the light. 2.5 billion people can't do that because they only have access to wood and charcoal for lighting, heating, and cooking. Even though charcoal is necessary for their existence, the production methods used waste most of the wood and lead to deforestation, famine, and pollution. While wind and solar energy will be wonderful replacements for charcoal, by the time they can be implemented, all that will be left is literal ash. That's where the clean and efficient charcoal kiln comes in. By recycling the pollutants as fuel and improving the overall efficiency of the production methods, the amount of wood or plant matter needed to make charcoal and the pollution generated will be significantly reduced. Thanks to its simple, continuous process design, this kiln will be easy to build, easy to maintain, simple to operate, and inexpensive to manufacture. By implementing this method, we will reduce pollution and deforestation while improving the lives of the impoverished.
