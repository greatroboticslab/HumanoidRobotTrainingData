 music excuse the mess this is just kind of our collect all I store everything that I know I'll need eventually gotta have a safe dry place to put everything uh oh I don't know what that was our old nesting box in need of some repair slow it out oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh We're going to be putting three pieces of strapping on here to secure the nest box. So I need to drill three holes. These are self-tapping sheet metal screws, but these holes being rounded, when you're trying to get the self-tapper going, it's going to slide all over the place. If you pre-drill it first with an eighth-inch bit, it works a lot better. Let's see what we can get. Four and a half inches to get it level. That's going to be too much, I think. Let's see what we can get. Then we're going to be screwing a 2x4 on edge. I'm just using these Irvin Quick Crimp clamps. In order to get it through the chicken wire, you just got to slide off the yellow. We're just going to... We're just going to... Flush up the bottom end. I'm just using 2 inch deck screws. Then for the next one, I'm just going to flush it with the top, putting it on its side. So we have three pieces of strapping, 61 inches long. Two pieces of 2x4, 48 inches long. Now we'll go ahead and mount the nesting box. Okay. Put one screw in on one end. So I'll do like this end first. Like over here? Like up on that end. So... This is a nesting box that was given to us, used. So this will be our third time setting it up. And I had this back piece, I took it off. Come to find out we need it. It holds the bottom part of the nesting box in place. Luckily, I still had it in the back of my truck. I hadn't made it to the dump yet to throw it away. So this back here has a lip on it. I'm going to screw it all back in. I'll show you what we need that little lip for. So this part of the tray goes down and in. And it sets in. That's what holds that in place. There's a lip on this, and there's a lip on this side. And then we got these. So I've enjoyed having the pigs out on the pasture all summer. Moving them twice a day has been fun. They get all excited every time they get on fresh grass. Let's see what they can find. But now, it's getting darker in the morning. And Olivia having to get on the school bus so early in the morning. I'm kind of looking forward to having the chickens in here. And not having to be outside at first thing in the morning. Moving around in the dark. Now I'll be able to have them in here. It's a different season, I guess. They'll be a little different in here. It'll be kind of interesting and fun. I'll be excited come summertime to get them back out on pasture. So it's funny how the seasons change. And you look forward to different things. The video is going a little bit long. We got the nest box in. I got the hay in.
