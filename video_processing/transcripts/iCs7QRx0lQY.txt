 Wow. I love finding old garden books. This is called The Garden of Experience by the author of Garden of Ignorance. And these old garden books are so cool, they don't have pictures. So they had to be excellent garden writers to actually paint a picture of what it was that you were learning in the garden and creating a garden. So look at this one I found. It's called A Sense of Humus. And it is another book written, oh, 60 years ago. And the pages, even the fact that they're faded, makes it just really cool to dive into really old gardening books. Here's one that's called The Embattled Male in the Garden. Now, hopefully it's written by a female and even has the old Seattle Public Library. I found these old books at a store that specializes in antique garden books. But I also found this one. This is Down the Garden Path. Now, it's written by a famous garden writer called Beverly Nichols. But when you read old garden books like this, it doesn't matter if there's no pictures because of the garden tips. Some of the advice in this book, one thing I remember Beverly Nichols writing about, was when you water lilies to use lukewarm water. Now, that's something I'd never heard before. And it's something that he learned, you know, 100 years ago, growing lilies. Now, if you can't find old antique garden books, they've been reissuing them. Timber Press is a publisher that's reissuing books by Beverly Nichols, the old garden writer. This one is Rhapsody in Green. And it's kind of the best of some of the old gardening advice that was written. So, if you love history, if you love old gardens and heritage gardens, start checking out some of these old historical garden books. It's a great way to really get down and dirty without going outside. So, yes. But as far as I remember the best, unfortunately, these old treatments will come out of this way and let me go out what I'm going towards. So, make sure to come out, you have to really get an opportunity to get paper, and I want to be in a partout.
