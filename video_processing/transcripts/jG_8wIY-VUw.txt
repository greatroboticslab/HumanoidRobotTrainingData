 Howdy friends, welcome back to the building of our homestead for the chicken coop. I think I've decided it's probably going to be a chicken palace build. Today we'll focus on putting up the wire mesh on the windows and the tops and I think if we work hard enough we could probably get the siding up. Let's get started, come along. So on this coop as you may have noticed it's going to be kind of an open design. A lot of the research I've done says that the open coops are kind of work a little bit better especially because we live in a very warm climate. Rarely do we get freezing and if we do have you know some freezing weather coming up we can just put some tarps over the front but we are going to do wire mesh along the top and the sides up in there. The research that I've been doing says that ventilation is key. Ventilate, ventilate, ventilate and the more ventilation you have the drier it's going to be and the healthier your chickens will be. I guess a moist, damp chicken area is not really very good. We are going to put siding here just to keep any critters, or anything that might want to try and get in there. Give them a harder time. And then also the wall that we built extends a little bit past the entry and that's going to be to kind of help the wind from whipping in and around. Just wanted to give you an overview on why we're doing more of an open style instead of just a sealed in tight type. But yeah, let's cut some wire and get that up. theme song mel hacemos Reedそうですね and then inhaleamos some wire can be May we heat up? Yoshiko ops Kevinvarr haven't seen a little hoop of lobster dick one take the counter and I соответσ sailors so you got to be careful when you're cutting the uh this wire at an angle see if it'll focus those points are razor sharp needle sharp it got me already all right finally we get to the siding portion of the uh chicken coop i went with a concrete siding four by eight sheet of uh hardy board is what it's called around here uh grooved it's cheaper that way for some reason the advantages of running uh concrete siding is it's not going to rot like uh wood siding one disadvantage though it doesn't have much sheer value to it so it's brittle so it's not going to it if the building moves too much it does have the chance of breaking so when we move it which it's going to be moved i'm gonna have to take a couple precautions to make sure it doesn't break too easily but like i said it's not going to rot especially up against the elements that it's going to have here with the chickens um and their business and stuff inside there but it's comparable to a wood siding and cost but you got your advantages either way so that's what i'm going to do it but first let's prep the wall for it to make it a little bit easier it is extremely heavy so yeah so i want to have this siding hang down below the floor so i made a mark below the flooring an inch and a half and i'm putting in this um ledger board and it'll hold the siding i'm doing this alone and that's really the easiest way to do it by yourself even if you're using wood or or other things like that so i'll just put this on put a screw in one side and level that across i guess another thing i should mention is it's really dusty so să sicbre에 So I got the siding on the sides and then the back. Before I finish up the back upper part, I wanted to show you what I got going on here. What I did is I had an old above ground pool that was holy. I wasn't really doing much pooling. And I cut a section off of it and put it over the nesting boxes here. And then once I get the siding on, I'm also going to do siding here. Um, we'll put a piece of plywood over this and then with some hinges, but this should keep this area dried off and looking fresh. Pretty much all I did was just put some roofing nails in right there. Basically, that's all it's doing. And then overlap my siding. Oh, it looks about three inches. And I'm not putting any nails down here because I want to keep the, uh, unholy. Uh, so yeah. Also on the side, we'll put siding on that little section right there and then hopefully get some trim going down and it'll cover up that gap there. But yeah, that's what's going on in the back. Time to get back and putting siding on. What does the chicken say? No. What does the chicken say? Blah. Blah. You like the chicken house? Yeah. I love it. You love it? I love it right here, right here. I love it right here.
