Water and wheat

Science & Technology
 It rarely rains during the wheat growing season at CIMMET's research station near Obregon in northwest Mexico. And ironic as it may seem, that makes Obregon an excellent site for testing rain-fed wheat systems. Researchers can precisely control water through carefully managed irrigation. They can simulate everything from extreme drought to monsoon rains. For Jan Manas, a rain-fed wheat breeder at CIMMET, this experiment to compare wheat yields under zero tillage with normally tilled wheat under precision water control was crying out to be done. There are three trials for each treatment. Two of them are two saw-wits, so two semi-aride yield trials. So they are genotypes which are tested internationally. Even when the wheat was still a bit green and not quite ready for harvest, he could see differences. The advantage here is that it's increasing the chance to have the remaining speculates better filled. As expected, wheat under zero tillage appeared to do better when subjected to water stress than the same wheat grown on a plowed field. But the proof is in the grain itself. Under water stress, different wheat lines may have different ways of compensating. Only after harvesting the grain, using these miniature combine harvesters, and a detailed analysis, could a result be determined. Of course, the zero tillage trial won, at least under the stress of less than optimum water. Among . Now, these are substances that provide any improvement to a target for inatum.
