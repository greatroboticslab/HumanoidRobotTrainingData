 Ready to revolutionize your garden with perennial vegetables? Forget the hassle of replanting every year and enjoy plants that return season after season. Start with asparagus. Plant it once, and it rewards you with bountiful spears for years. Sunchokes bring a nutty twist to your meals, while the groundnut gives you both tubers and beans. Artichokes with their cactus-like look produce more each year. Rhubarb adds color and flavor to desserts, but remember, its leaves are toxic. Horseradish is a spicy perennial that grows fast and strong, while radicchio thrives in cool seasons with its tangy bite. Bunching onions are perfect for your kitchen, and sorrel, with its lemony zing, is super easy to grow. Transform your garden into a perennial paradise and enjoy effortless, long-lasting harvests.
