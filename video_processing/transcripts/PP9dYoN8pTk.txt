 The End Getting hit hurts. But coming into contact with a moving part hurts a whole lot more. It can result in serious injury and even death. Every year, of all work accidents, contact with moving parts of a machine cause an average of 20 deaths, 300 amputations and more than a thousand fractures. Construction professionals are particularly at risk because of all the equipment we use in our everyday work. As a construction professional, you should already know how to avoid and control the risk of injury from contact with a moving part. Since there can be serious consequences, and there are several ways to prevent it, the risk of injury from contact with moving parts is considered zero tolerance. On a construction site, there is a lot of machinery and powered equipment with moving parts. That's why it's essential to prevent or control access to moving parts. On some machinery and equipment, the moving parts must be made 100% inaccessible even during operation. These machines must be equipped with guards or safety devices that completely prevent access to moving parts. On other machinery and equipment, contact with moving parts can't be prevented during operation. In which case, access can only be controlled. All such machinery must be equipped with guards and or safety devices. Regularly check that all safety devices are in place, in good condition and undamaged, and working properly. If you notice any defect or malfunction, do not use the equipment and make the necessary adjustments or repairs. Never remove or block a safety device. And also, never tamper with a guard or safety device, such as overriding the limit switch on a mortar mixer. If your machinery or equipment needs maintenance, such as a blade replacement, you should, at minimum, unplug it or remove the battery. In some cases, lockout will be required. And on top of having compliant equipment, you have to use it properly too. One wrong move during operation can be fatal. This is why it's so important to properly train and inform your workers so that they respect all the preventive measures and safety rules in effect. Being a professional is all about proper planning. Because that's how you finish a job safely.
