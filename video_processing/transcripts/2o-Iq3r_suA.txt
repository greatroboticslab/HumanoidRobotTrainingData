Howto & Style
 Hello, we're going to be potting this four inch up to a one gallon container. It's good to do this before you put it in the ground because they're showing that you'll grow bigger, stronger plants by doing this. So we're going to take this four inch Oregon Spring Heirloom Tomato and I'm going to go ahead and open it up. And we use Mycorrhiza fungus here and you can tell it's really helping the roots to grow well. So what I'm going to do is just put a little bit of soil in the bottom of the pot. You want to plant your plant as deep as possible. I'm going to set them in there and very lightly open up the roots. I'm going to pinch off any leaves that are below the soil line. And I'm going to add more Mycorrhiza. And you want to add that right along the root zone. As you can see. So once that's in there, go ahead and fill your container. And as I've said, it's good to do this. So when you buy your four inch plants, bring them home and pot them up to a gallon. And then they're good to go in the gallon until they're ready to go in the ground. And this will really give them a jump start. So what I do is I just kind of fill the thing. And you just, you never want to press down because roots need oxygen as well as water. So we don't want to compact the soil. I'm just going to give it a couple taps. See if I need to add any more soil. Add. And you want to leave enough room for watering. Remember your plant stake. And there we go. A perfectly planted gallon pot. Thank you. Thank you.
