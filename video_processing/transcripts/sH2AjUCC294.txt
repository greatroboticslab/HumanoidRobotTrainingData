 A blend of learning and vacation promoted as Learncation is being actively implemented in Jeju. Students are stepping out of their campuses to freely observe, feel and enjoy Jeju while engaging in interesting projects. This collaboration with young people is also breathing new life into rural villages. Todd Thacker reports. An intriguing project is underway in Shenheung-ni, the easternmost village of Nanwon-up, Sogipo City. It's a social innovation semester jointly carried out by Gyeonghi University students and the local community. Since March, students and residents have been actively reviewing the results of their work. The social innovation semester is part of Jeju's flagship Learncation initiative. Students have developed local brands using regional specialties and planned tourism content aimed at revitalizing local businesses and attractions. Through hands-on experiences outside the classroom, students gained valuable insights. Moreover, the once-quiet village, with its young people having moved away, has been revitalized thanks to the students' Learncation activities. Since 2019, Gyeonghi University has been involved in Jeju's urban regeneration projects, discovering and developing local initiatives. In Daejeong-up Sogipo, students worked closely with local residents over a long period, creating specialty products and revitalizing local commerce. These efforts have now evolved into a broader learn-cation policy, expanding the business model. I think that if there were any other things in our village, it would be really fun to theITY of the stayed in one week. D This growing connection between universities and local communities is now gaining attention as a sustainable model to combat regional depopulation. Todd Thacker, KCTV.
