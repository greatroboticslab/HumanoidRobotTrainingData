 It really works out for me because the cattle stay in a little better shape. I don't have to put as much feed to them all winter. I can maintain them a little easier. I can meet some of my grass goals of knocking back cool season grasses and I can have healthy calves on green grass. It just really works for me in my operation. It's a little less stress on everybody. It works well timing it with nature.
