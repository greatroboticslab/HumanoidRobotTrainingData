 Hello, Howie Jones here. Seed potatoes. Yep. Plant them. Yep. Seed potatoes. All different kinds. All different kinds. None of them are the same. I like these blue ones for fish. They go good with salmon and cod. These are elephant garlics. They're big garlics. And throw them in. Ground again. I've got a lot of garlic anyway. Put it in. It should be fun. These red potatoes, these look good. These look awesome. Nice. Nice seed potatoes. Yeah. The fingerlings are cool. You know, that's... Original. I'd say. Yeah. Yeah. I like these big white ones, too. I've been in the sun a little bit. They're green. You don't want to eat them ones. You want to plant them ones. There's all different kinds here. Here's another. Here's some more. I think there's a bad one in here. This is seed potatoes. That happens. Yeah, there it is. Oh, too bad. Nice. You've got to get it out, though. There we go. I didn't get a chance to... To... Grow, but that's okay. All these will. Bye. Okay.
