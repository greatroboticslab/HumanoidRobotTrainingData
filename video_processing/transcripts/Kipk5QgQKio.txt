 We've been building a big water system to send. We have a lot of elevation change in this property. There's several, probably 500 feet from top to bottom or 400 something feet. So we have a spring at the bottom. So we've been sending that water up high and then storing it high and then using it to gravity feed through like irrigated pastures. And, you know, I kind of have this dream of building a small hydroelectric plant, like just like a two-inch PVC pipe with a hydroelectric plant. So, you know, at night I can spring that water back down the hill and create power at night, which is what my problem is now, right? I have so much power during the day, but nothing at night. So if I can send the water uphill and then at night pull it back down through a hydro, a little hydro plant and just feed my system, then I'm fully, you know, I never need that generator to turn on. Do you also irrigate along the way? Yeah, you can. So then we'd pull it down and then we'd go even further and irrigate farther down with it. So, you know, with the animals right now, we don't have, like, we could probably keep growing our herd a little bit. So, think we'll be � MILMING ISTING ME FAMES¿ просy to do it per day. So, we'll try to do it again. Thanks for having us on the birdль level now. So we'll take Wahr Bal� and get a little bit of a painful path.
