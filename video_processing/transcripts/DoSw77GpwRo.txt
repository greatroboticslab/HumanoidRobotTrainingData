 oh Doing something a little bit different today. We're working over 300 goats got our hands full. We're gonna dive into some details of goat Ranching with the poke family Joe poke and his wife and their two daughters doing something that's very important We're gonna work their goats today. Babies billies nannies all of them and they're going back out in the pasture So I Got the all That one right there Oh That's a That's a That's a That's a That's a That's a That's a That's a That's a That That So Kevin my stepdad and Joe poke a work together for the Noble Foundation If you don't know a little about Kevin, Kevin is the goat and sheep guy. Always has been been into the sheep and goats business for Probably ever since he was a kid And then Kevin does some stuff with goats at the Noble Foundation and works with Joe poke But this is Joe and his wife's little side hustle They eat her up at cell Now we know obviously there's a huge difference between working goats and bison Definitely a lot more hands-on experience when you're working the goats But honestly, it's not that much different Other than you're dealing with a thousand pound animal Versus anywhere from 60 to 100 pound animal It's the same sort of process So once we kind of corral the goats and get them from one big pen to a smaller pen And even into another smaller pen From there is where you have to sort the nannies away from the kids All of these goats today are getting proper vaccinations Just like we would when we were working the bison So if we've got calves They're going to get a couple of different vaccinations Those are one-time vaccinations for their whole life Such as blackleg Oh, I can handle that Oh, I can handle that I can handle that Get push his legs Woo Pull that all in Yeah, we got We got These baby goats are getting the same thing So that's why they're kind of separated And also Most of the mills Are we're going to get banded And this is part of the meat industry In goats And so this is pretty standard When you have When you're working females and males The boys If you're not selling them for a breeding goat Then they're going to be used on the meat side of things Obviously for grazing and stuff Which is what the poquets are doing In this But in order to make a profit off your animals You've got to Either sell some for breeding Or meat And in this case This area of the United States The goat meat And hair sheep meat Is becoming very popular And is a growing industry So Just as a farmer Raising crops Or a bison ranch Or raising bison You've got to be able to pay your bills Pay for your fencing Or feed Or any of that You've got to be able to sell some animals To make a profit To pay those bills And It doesn't matter how many animals you have Whether it's 300 Or you have 10 Okay so I don't know anything about The ear cutting It's just male female Oh Okay I wasn't sure either Male female I don't have a I didn't get my tags in time Gotcha I would have tagged them But Then I know Because we're going to have another Flock of them here Yeah So You'll know We work these ones Yeah And so what Left ears Left ear is female And right ear is male Okay Is that right? It's a thing It's a thing? Okay Early's you want to pet this? It's nice to meet you What do you think Brooks? They work good They're cute aren't they? So cute Don't touch that It's an owie It's yucky She's been doctored Two or three times Yeah He's cute He's so cute How old? Oh gosh Probably like A couple weeks Okay Yeah Oh wait Is those umbilical Oh yeah Probably a week A week? I was going to say They're small They're so tiny No I like this one I just get them This is more warmer It's a different warmer Than what we're given Before Okay I get a different Class of worms in them Gotcha That's it Is it targeting One specific? Probably But I don't know Oh yeah Well I wouldn't either So Do you got it? Okay All right you want to look at her feet? ahhh we Yeah, I can go ahead and do the job. Yeah, let's just put a little stupidie here. This one doesn't work. It's the third time. He's like... Yeah, I don't think it's going to get out. We need that other back. So what did you just give her, Kevin? A sore mouth vaccine. A sore mouth, and then that's just a dewormer? No, no, no, no, no. From here is a great angle. You can see the sorting of the nannies versus the kids. As you can see here, it's very important to have good equipment, a good handling facility, so you're able to sort out your animals in an efficient way. Nannies, billies, kids, and you can work them properly, and then let them back out into the pasture. These animals are not in here for very long, and they're being handled in a short amount of time. Just like in the bison industry, you've got to have good equipment, and Joe here set up the pens perfectly, and I think everything went great. C and D, which is for? Clostridial peripherens, C and D. This one actually does B, and tetanus. And tetanus. All the above. Okay. D is like overeating disease. Okay. C is like... What's type C? I can't remember. Oh, it's like a sour gut thing, I think. Yeah, that's... I can't... I know D is like overeating. Yeah, D is overeating. And the T is just straight. It used to be everybody gives straight cat, but now they mix them. You can still buy straight cat. Oh, you're good. I was just listening to them. You can still buy straight cat. So, they will get that now. In the spring, will you redo it like in the fall? Probably not. Probably not? It just depends. So, we do it now, so hopefully they pass a little bit of immunity to the red ones. Okay. Because a lot of these hopefully are red to kid here in another two months. So, we want to give it to them now the way the kids can get it. And then when we vaccinate the kids, they're a little more protected against it. Sure. Because, once, Clostridia isn't everything. Like, it's everywhere. I don't know. Is that like a... That's what we're vaccinating for. The Clostridia preferential is and there's different strains of it. And it's like, it lives in the soil. It's everywhere. It's not... Everybody has it. It's in your gut, you know, microflora and stuff. But when you get stressed or you have an inflammation of some kind, then it'll take... It's a bacteria. It'll take over and cause problems. Gotcha. Gotcha. Did you do this on my way, Dusty? Yes, sir. Get in here. Whoop, we got kend for it. Woo! Golly! Well, Kevin least poke some of these Billys and they can spread their love and just be like Big Joe being rented and going to somebody else's property. same thing this is just another way to make a profit off your animals you can actually rent or lease out your billies and other producers can use those billies different genetics different breeds for their own benefit needs a little wd-40 I'd say oh oh he about oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh okay we're ready ready girls I thought you want to let them out did you give them this the two little ones were those work yeah they already had 10 I think they got worked already okay they're the they're the escape artists I think right here we go come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on it's you're so funny Mom! Mom! Mom! No! all right here it is the last big group of goats that are going to get work today kind of takes a team effort on something like this instead of using a pusher like we would for the bison obviously way more dangerous situation when working bison but as far as goats just kind of corralling them and pushing them and funneling down into a smaller pen and obviously into another smaller pen same thing that we would do with bison goats will be goats and if there's one animal i would compare bison to i compare them to goats all the time as far as behavior goes they're just so curious they're so nosy just like a goat i think bison are just as nosy i'll just ask okay so joe's here and one of the questions that i think is important uh for me people have talked to me about using you know we have our bison and they're after the grasses one of the things that people always mention is using goats for cleanup that the bison don't eat can you talk about multi-species grazing joe does this full time already for the noble foundation and then as a side hustle too so i mean he's got a lot of experience so what's your opinion of the using the goats so i'm fairly new to goats too only in the last three or four years but you can see pretty quickly the impact they have on the land and the good thing is a lot of this land hasn't had goat impact so it's really prime for it and they they would prefer to eat the browse and the forbs and you know leave the grass so when we mix that with a large room like bison or cattle or something the symbiosis the nature symbiosis is apparent you know it's pretty obvious so at this place here we've got at least we there's a lot of a lot of brush that we're trying to beat it back a little bit so we're stocked pretty aggressively but that's on purpose to help open some of this up and then of course we let everything have adequate rest to grow back so the way it's split now this is kind of the open half and then the wooded half is over there so we graze them over here in the winter and then what's been really cool and we should go i go take you around look at it yeah what's really cool here is in the winter we just had this rested for an entire summer so there's a lot of dead native grass but the little three and four foot tall cedars there's nothing left of them yep they destroyed every one of them yep well you can even look right here behind you oh yeah and you can see what four or five feet tall there's no green underneath those trees and it's not because i mean we're pretty early in the spring too but this is that's the browse line yeah and right now i usually have them a little more fenced in right now we're just trying to get around everything very fast so they have a big area which is not how we manage it normally but just the kind of context we are right now so they kind of get this and they get to pick at the brush over there and there's not enough just to lock them on it so yep but they're getting all this really emerging stuff and you're absolutely right they're definitely a browse line here and that's only from you know the 30 days the brush has been growing that's crazy yeah and the cedar tree thing too is like bison will they're not going to eat it but they're going to whip it so bad and they can break it and it eventually die but a goat's going to come through and gnaw on those those things and once they lose their needles they're i mean they're dead they're going to die and and they the goats really prefer that in the winter time it complements their diet you know there's a lot of tannins and cedar too that helps kind of with the parasites yep keeping them clean and you know healthy so you know we can i can let's go around my truck and i'll show you some show you yeah and there's definitely some cedar trees that they've killed just for me and all the needles but too some of the bigger ones they've rung the run the bark and yeah on the cadmium cadmium or yeah i can't remember yeah but they get in that layer of the bark and that that's going to kill that kills it too yeah absolutely and we're not trying to kill all the trees but no this is a jungle it's kind of unmanageable so goats can open that up and we you know we might do some mechanical intervention to open the canopy up to get some more native grasses growing because you know ideally we're in the cross-timbers eco region right so we want this to be a cross-timber savannah yes scattered trees and lots of grass and they're going to help you get they're going to help you clean it up enough where you can see okay we need to get in here with maybe a skid steer that's right you know and and do that so so the other thing is to me i think the goat thing is becoming a more approachable side hustle and maybe full-time for some people um not only if it's multi-species species grazing but it they're just they're they can be difficult like keeping them in your fence but no different than bison keep them happy and fed watered all those things but just you know like it's a business it's a little side business now and i think it's more approachable um now because i think more people are saying hey you can use these animals to clean up your property and as long as you got good fencing and all those things keep them happy you can run a business off of it that's right and you know the way things are today with the barrier to entry to getting started in agriculture is really really high right yeah mostly capital but you know we're we're first generation ranchers and we've been doing this professionally i've been doing it professionally for somebody else for over 20 years we're not new by any means but we're still first generation trying to make our make our run at it and i always get i always think of saying like you got to be willing to do what other people aren't willing to do yep and lots of people would rather just have cows and i want to have a ranging business yeah so if the guys are going to help us do that and it wasn't without us work you know somebody told me that you get paid to learn how to keep goats in and i always thought that was funny because i've spent more time working on the fence here yeah i mean there was four or five months just working on the fence uh-huh but knowing just from my experience at work too just knowing that that was the important yeah don't have to be chasing them around absolutely yeah i want to i want to get some of course cedars they all know that they all know that i hate cedar trees yeah let's give him a trick and i'll go show you okay let's go look at them that has just been gobbled up like there's nothing left of those cedars nothing left and now that tree instead of having i don't know eight nine ten cedar trees taking water you've got a big oak tree that can can get some more water and it creates a better habitat for whether turkeys want to roost there or not yeah it got up there high enough but if they need to they can stand up push that thing over and eat it i've watched them do that if they have to that's pretty cool little one in the back they were barking that one yeah so they are knocking the bark off of it that is so cool yeah that's good stuff so this is something that a bison will not do they do not won't browse off these type of trees but what a bison will do is rub and rub and rub it rub it till they're all broke and then they snap and then they're dead yeah it looks ugly for a while until it rots away but yeah all of those right here under this big oak tree pretty cool yep there is all those look at all those cedars yeah and they're ripping the bark off that one over there yeah so and that was really good feed this winter for them absolutely balances the gut and they're getting what they need and then i guarantee you before you put these goats in there you couldn't see that green grass on the other side oh for sure you could this was all completely covered and now wildlife can go in and out of there 100 percent yep we're big on deer habitat too and yep you can go over here on stuff that doesn't have a go to them so here this is what you'd call more than likely field fence starts out low or it starts out small here and it gets bigger as you get to the top and this one's only going to be 36 inches tall three feet up here on the side of my hip this is your typical goat fence and as long as you got plenty of forage you keep them happy they don't need to jump over anything you could also keep predators out as well i think you think this helps uh keep coyotes out yeah you can find them so like here little crawl spaces this was a this is just a wash but i put a log in there you know yeah but goats get out there too so yeah they will across the fence you can see yeah that's a good way to look at it so this is obviously joe's look at this all of the growth all the underbrush you i mean you can't see through there at all and then you come over here and you can see 30 40 yards in there to the other side you can see the browse line this is only four months having them in here four months you know yeah not continuously they yeah they graze this in december and then they've had access access to it now for probably the last two weeks so it's had a little bit of rest but yeah definitely definitely a major difference between the two sides absolutely yeah you can see all the way through there that's so cool yeah we just saw a goat and deer can see that and yeah pigs and whatever else you know whatever wildlife you want turkeys quail i mean they're more determined to run through some of this stuff now yeah and forage and well they have a chance to i mean they can pick their way through that but it's just kind of a jungle yeah i mean i wouldn't want to go through that you know me neither so yeah this looks awesome it looks really good something i've learned about the bison too in places like this i was like worried do i need goats do i need to put goats in some of our um brushy areas or our tree lines you know i thought about doing that but what the bison have done is they're just big and broad and don't care they just bulldoze through there and you you'd be surprised they'll go through and nip at stuff for sure but they'll just blow through there and create and open it up it's kind of surprising so so the next issue we have is we can see what's going on here now but there's still not very much sunlight getting through the canopy so like all these little trees we're just gonna have to come in here mechanically and yeah open the canopy up yeah you know you leave the big and yeah leave the big oaks and pecans and stuff like that but yeah and so traditionally all the ungulates would have handled that way back when that's right but when you put a fence up and then you don't manage it you take away from you know what nature would have been doing hundreds of years ago take the ungulates away and then all the shrubby stuff that uh a deer or an antelope that were here back in the day or elk and bison would have wouldn't have let any of this stuff happen and then you don't manage it and here's what happens or fire too or fire yeah that's what i was fixing to say like these big these are big honey locusts and stuff yeah they're they're good they can be good fodder for wildlife too but they'll take over an area pretty easy too fast they'll do it fast they can be invasive yeah so you when you put a fence up all that changes if you don't manage it but i would almost guarantee you that this was all peanuts or cotton at some time oh i mean look how big these oak trees are yeah there's not big oak trees like that out in the middle and then there's a lot of there's an old wheel line wheels here and all aluminum pipe so you know this wasn't always a forest like that's the main argument is like well you're letting nature go back to what nature wants to do well this was probably plowed in the 30s and 40s it was peanuts yep you know yep yeah there are some big trees in here and then over time it can happen yep this is what this is how it goes and so you just got the deer whether the hogs too that we have now but all the antelope are gone all the bison are gone all the elk are gone and so you can kind of follow up or add in the goats and this is what you get that's right i like it thanks joe yeah it's good stuff that is a big old tree in there is that a pecan is it i've never looked very close at it look at her i want to crush that right there a little bitty well brooks marissa and i want to personally thank the poke family for inviting us out to do a little goat ranching today i hope you guys learned something new about goat ranching i know it's a little bit different than bison ranching but it's great to compare those species and you can kind of imagine the same thing the goats can do and what the bison can do and what those type of animals were doing historically on the great plains you can thank all the ungulates goats and bison deer elk and all of them that kept the great plains wide open and full of native grasses i want to thank them for letting us a video today and showing their operation and what they do great people great old family i love what they're doing thank you guys for watching us we'll see you guys soon we're in keep up boston ranching you
