 more good couldn't go much further back without opening the garage so i've been dealing with this flat tire for too long and took my own advice got some flat out so we showed the the multi-seal version this is like the small little gallons for smaller tires but multi-seal we had rick out about a year ago i guess it was and he brought a whole test tire that he takes to all of his shows and just traveling around the country and doing things with and it's just mounted to like a receiver on the back of his on the back of his truck and he takes like a railroad spike or something a big old spike and just hammers it into the tire like he's got hundreds and hundreds of punctures in there and it just doesn't leak it holds air it's just crazy and so we finally got some of this stuff i need to use it i've actually had my my air hose out here just refill it on the random times that i i come use it and just fill it back up and then it goes flat by the next day every time so we're going to do something about that today i bought some flat out you can save five percent with code gwt on that i'll put a link to their website um comes with the stuff you need to do and basically if you get a lot of flat tires like i do i should put this in every single thing machine that i have i just haven't yet they've got a version on the multi-seal website that actually mixes with liquid ballast like rim guard as well so you can put it in an air filled tire or with a liquid filled tire pretty cool stuff but i am sick and tired of dealing with this flat so hopefully this takes care of it comes with everything you see here you can buy it in different sizes for different tires this i think would fill if i remember right would fill all four of these tires on this utv if i filled all four but right now we're going to do one and then i'll feel the paint again next time i get a flat although we've been using that mini dump primarily so what i'm doing well let me tell you the instructions there's only five steps i think it was rotate the tire so the valve stem is near the top that's what we just got done doing remove the valve core with the tool provided and allow the tire to deflate fully i think we're already at that point but we'll we got to get the valve core out of there so we can fill it up then you attach this pump fill it up remove the hose replace the valve core inflate to the recommended pressure and re re re uh re put the valve cap back on let me put that somewhere i'm not going to lose it it just has little grooves it's got two sizes or two two sizes and two sides with a groove in there just put the right one in there a little bit of air but not much left okay so that's our valve core all right don't want to lose that we'll put that in the same bag put our tool back in there put that on there i don't think we need that though do we i'll leave it down there sure why not there put that in there okay so it says um one pump equals one ounce and in a tire 27 inches or smaller use 32 ounces i guess i should double check that i think i did before but i should double check because 32 ounces 64 and then double 128 i feel like that's what it was going to be for this this whole thing so anyway um one ounce per stroke so 32 strokes for 32 ounces the difference between flat out and the competition up to a half inch seals punctures up to a half inch compared to a quarter inch from the competition single treatment works for 10 plus years versus up to a couple years cleanup stays liquid easy clean up with water versus latex or adhesive base becomes a sticky mess so it's got some advantages there let's do it so i got to put this on here like this and it's not going to spill all out i guess this fits right on doesn't it let's get that right on there all the way that's as far as that can go huh make sure that's something that part already came on you ready see if this works watch it fill up the tube oh we gotta wait i'm not gonna count so it's not there it's almost there i'll count okay so there it's there now one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty that's twenty wow it does seem i mean that's just one ounce per pump huh twenty one twenty two twenty twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one thirty two okay so i gotta take that out and then replace the valve core here like can you can you show them that see how that that uh the end is you know it's not round so this can fit right around there see how that works so they can grab it spin is that how i uh that must be the end that went in though oh yeah okay that goes this part goes this part goes all the way into the tire on the inside and then it is fitting those threads right in there okay is this going to make a big mess not a big mess that's nice okay get this on here and get that to twist back in okay so far this has been pretty easy okay okay okay that's on there nice and tight put my oh we don't want to put the cap on yet um next step we got a filler full of air okay okay well that's it okay so this part's the easy part right i'll know by this time tomorrow i'd know when i wake up tomorrow if it actually works or not it didn't say anything about driving around like to you know like get it to fill out or anything like that which i still feel like i might do that anyways just because it seems like it would make sense even if it even if they don't talk about it the other thing i don't know about is we did add 32 liquid ounces in there so that is more weight that's in this side versus the other side now i almost feel like it would be a smart move to put it in the other side so it's balanced out maybe that only matters at higher speed applications i'm not sure because this is i think they have low speed and high speed applications you'll see on their website it'll it'll go through all that so we don't sell this stuff but you can go to the flat out website and the multi-seal website and and get a pump that's super handy like really that wasn't very hard so as long as this works which we'll find out here because otherwise it'll be flat it fixes most types of punctures right i mean i don't know what type of issue i have that's leaking out right now there are certain things that it i think it doesn't fix but it fix fixes most things so we're going to see if it works for this one and fingers crossed we'll find out soon so that's what i've got for you today this is one of those things you want to do as a preventative measure and we're doing this as a what's the opposite of preventative postventative measure and uh yeah i need to order more of it so i can put in my tractors too because i'm sure i'm going to get flats and i'm sure i'm going to be in the same position saying the same thing at some point in the future doing this after the fact now we don't sell this stuff but we do sell
