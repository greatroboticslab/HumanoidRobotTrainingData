 If you own land, more than likely you've got weeds. And so it's the responsibility of landowners to control noxious weeds, as well as other weeds that might affect your cropping economics. When you're storing chemicals, it is to be behind locked doors and you're also asked to put a sign up that indicates the pesticides are behind that locked door. This avoids anybody from getting in and maybe taking it or kids getting in close contact with it, that type of thing. So also we're doing chemical pickup and as you come to pick up your chemical, make sure that you store it on the back of your vehicle out in the open. So instead of inside of the car, also make sure that if you're using flatbed pickups or trailers that you secure your load and you do not lose that in transport. Another mistake that we've seen is leaving your chemical unattended. If you're going to go out to your field and make an application, many people have basically chemical trucks that they store them in and they leave them unattended for long periods of time. And there's been mishaps of chemical getting stolen or if you really don't have neighbors that like you, there's been cases of people putting chemical in your spray tank kind of as a bad prank. It's your responsibility to keep that chemical under lock and key and under your control at all times. Another one to keep in mind is that always store the chemical in its original containers and you want those container labels to be facing outward so everybody knows where what chemical that they are exposed to. Also when you're handling chemicals or transporting chemicals, make sure that you do have the proper safety equipment. In the event that there's a spill, you want to make sure that you've got some cat litter or some chemical to kind of absorb the spill. And then if it is significant enough that you report that to the poison control center and assist with control to your attempts to clean that mess up. Again, we hope that everybody has a safe spring season. And if you have questions, you're always welcome to contact your local Extension office.
