 Folks, let's talk hybrid tractor tires. These are grown in popularity. These are a combination tire, right? You take an R1, an R3, and an R4. So a turf tire, an ag tire, an industrial tire, the best properties of all those rolled into one. We have the VersaTurf over here, the R14 here. Pretty similar, different manufacturers making them. The VersaTurfs are gonna be available for the subcompacts and some small compact tractors. The R14s are gonna have a lot of sizes for all the different tires in the compact tractor range. Some manufacturers are seeing the light, like Summit. Yep, these are a premium tire at a premium price point. They come standard on the Summit TX25. If you're buying a new tractor, see if you can get these tires on there. Or if you need a new set of tires, find an industrial tire shop, like a place that works on semis or off-road equipment, that kind of thing. They can probably find these tires for you. You can get the Carlisle VersaTurfs on Amazon. They're not gonna tear up your lawn, but if you need to go off-road as well, in the dirt, in the woods, even on snow and ice, they're gonna perform way better than most other tires on the market. These tires provide optimal traction, tread life, and versatility.
