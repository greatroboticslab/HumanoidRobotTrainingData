Howto & Style
 Hi, welcome to Uncle Tim's Farm. I'm Uncle Tim and in today's episode I'm gonna be working on the footing for the feeder pigs around their feeder. Anyhow I'm gonna be putting down some mulch. It's gonna take a lot because that mud's really deep. This way it'll make it much easier for them to stand there and fill their bellies up. Well that's 13 bags so that should about do it. We'll see how well this holds up but it sure made it a lot better. Looks like the pigs are enjoying it. That'll make it much easier for them to stand there at the feeder and fill their bellies. It was a deep muddy mess but this is much much better for them. Thanks for watching. Come back again next time and don't forget to subscribe. See ya! Bye!
