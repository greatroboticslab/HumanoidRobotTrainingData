 In the past two decades, there has been a notable increase in pesticide-related activities within indigenous peoples' territories in Guatemala. The introduction of pesticides without sufficient capacity building in these communities has contributed to serious challenges, including soil degradation, loss of biodiversity and health problems. The majority of farmers and families don't know how to read or write, so they don't read the letters, but they only buy the product because there is a promotion. We used it like they sell it, and we put it in the bomb, we fumigate it, and that's it. There are people who leave pesticides in their labor, and when it rains, they are thrown out by the plurals. And then it becomes a conflict and a problem for water bodies, for health and even for the farmers' residents. I have infected with infections, I have infected with pharingitis. I don't know why. I've been 16, 17 years old and not used pesticides. My disease has reduced slowly and slowly. And thank God I'm now good. It's very rare that I'm sick. FAO met with over 100 farmers and fishers from more than 10 indigenous peoples' communities. To avoid problems associated with using chemicals, indigenous peoples are turning to ancestral knowledge and innovative practices to mitigate risks. The natural pesticides that we use are the apazote, the madracacao, the onion, and the ajo, because it has a very strong smell, so it's going to the plague. We use a repellent for plants, we use the wildflower, the chiltep, the most spicy, the albahaca, the tobacco, the ajo, that's what we use. All these knowledge have been through my grandparents, my dad is a farmer who doesn't use chemicals. Their deep understanding of natural ecosystems and sustainable farming methods plays a vital role in protecting their health, biodiversity, and ensuring food security. This is something very important, to know very well the care of our seeds, our care of our medicinal plants, our natural resources. This piece of seed, I sowed, onion, onion, onion, onion, and now with organic seed, we see that we are resuciting all of our plants. We started to sow trees, the birds came, we started to diversify the land. As we move forward, it is essential to strengthen pesticide management and protect indigenous peoples' rights as highlighted in the UN General Assembly. The benefits are that the food is completely healthy. We don't have enough money to buy chemicals, all those things that are added to the agroindustries plants. What we are doing is to contribute to our Mother Nature. By promoting awareness, training, and adherence to the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management, we can empower these communities to continue their critical work in safeguarding our shared future. We have good practices for healthy food, for clean agriculture. We have to promote an associative culture for economic inclusion and promote a culture of good agricultural practices to produce healthy food. We have a people with to Basic Wildlife and plut demise.
