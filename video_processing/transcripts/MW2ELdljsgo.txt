 music music music music music music well good morning we're actually going to hear Allie Bellow I guess as you know here's the stanchion we use you see this is just always old Fitz board it always did everything it needed for Elsa kept her in a barrier kept me away now Allie will go in but Allie gets a little crazy so we're going to beef this up that way it is ready for her to go buck wild in here because most time we're not putting her in and locking her down we're fixing to start because her stanchion training is going to get a little bit longer a little bit more intense because she's getting closer to having a calf so we need to make sure she is ready so we're going to go ahead and put the cross bar in to pull her close to us like we had in the other stanchion also we're going to beef these up a little bit to where once we wrap up and put a chain around them she can't get out of them and then this backboard right here which is just old fence post or a fencing it's just a little really one by six we're going to go ahead and beef up put a two by four here and get it real tight on her that way she will be well she will be tough but she can't jump out and break it down like she could with this little board so i don't think she knows what's in store for so you see i put a bolt in i bolted on the side just got a simple hook another bolt to this two by four now what i'm going to do is take this two by four and use it like it's supposed to be used and basically i'll pull it in with the chain against her rear end right there and that way it keeps her very close to me where she can't move also when i'm done with that i'm going to take this take that two by four and brace it right here to where it keeps her tight against me too so that way she's encapsulated with really two by fours more than just the look of a stanchion this stanchion is beefed up up top but i never really beefed this up because i never had to but now with like i said with ally and kind of training her a little bit more and she's a little bit more stubborn and bullheaded i'm gonna um just kind of beef it up but so i've got this started as you see got that in we're gonna go ahead around to the other side put the bolt on it over here and then finish up right here and then that way i'm gonna get her in let her let you see me uh go ahead and do a stanchion training on her and then that way we'll kind of get her prepared okay so i got it done got this bar up got it uh secured in we put this extra uh heavier duty clamp here what we'll do is have this swing this will just hang like this until she gets in once she gets in i'll just unlatch this it'll drop this chain and then i'll just put this here and latch it on right there so it's not gonna be hard we're just gonna see if this will work i'm gonna put her in it and i'll just not stress her out but just kind of leave her in here especially after food's done and see if she can still get out um we're trying to get it to where she really can't get out we've got the you know the v-stanchion i've never really had to close it for Elsa i am gonna uh close it on Allie's head just cause the horns and i don't want her trying to horn me so uh i've got a chain to go around that too so let's let's see if we can get her in uh let her do some training uh let her just eat and kind of calm down then i'm gonna try to lock her in and see if it makes a difference kick her in and see if we can get her over and get her ready to go i'll be a lot more sweeter on this once i do a few times alright so there we go we'll tighten this up just a little bit okay there we go alright so you see how we got her tighter let me see see how we got her tighter she can't really move so that's how we got the stanchion done now we're gonna work on a little stanchion training this is how we've been doing Allie and this is how we kind of keep her from uh from actually um trying to kick me so Aiden's gonna go get a towel and also get some apple cider vinegar spray and we'll go ahead and at least get a little training done and try to rub on her a little bit and uh the main thing is letting her feel like uh she's comfortable so the kids are here petting her and we're just talking around her we've ran the pump around her i've felt all over but every time she kicks i'll give her a good pop on that hind leg and that teaches her no so she's done really good i mean she really has but you know standing here for five minutes eating that's not locked in so now i'm gonna stand here maybe 30 or 40 minutes locked in uh without her calf being the one to milk her we'll see how that goes but again training is all part of getting her broken in so Aiden's gonna get that stuff and we'll go ahead and see if we can spray her a little bit show you how we uh have been breaking her and see if it's gonna work hopefully when she has this calf all right so this is typically how we milk again she's she's a lot smaller than Elsa now you see she's got her leg behind her i don't know why she's standing like that we have been working with her so i'll grab her like i do Elsa and she'll move her leg back now i've never seen her leg go behind her so that's a new trick so we'll see what she does when i try to feel on her you see that she's not kicking me yet she used to kick me if i got anywhere close she does have good feed i don't feed her unless i'm stanching training her so she sees this a treat again apple cider vinegar is what we use to to make sure the cow gets covered and cleaned off trying to slip out my hands okay so we want to train her uh like we were just now milking her so what we're gonna do is just kinda see she's trying to adjust so come on come on come on see just grab her right there and she'll use it adjust now she may do it again because she's still trying to work on training you see i'm just trying to just get her used to me just feeling on her she's doing good now she do never never get comfortable even with the cow that you've been training for a while uh unless you are you're comfortable with her milking for even a year or two because uh Elsa i'm comfortable with but just because she's been milking almost a year i don't want to ever think that that eight eight nine hundred thousand pound cow cannot you know hurt me well this one's smaller but she's even more feistier and she's not used to milking i want to make sure she's comfortable and the last thing i'll do is just trust her and put my head down here and try to get her uh and try to just trust her that way so we're just going to do a little bit more training let her stand here eat let me just kind of mess with her as if i was fisting a milker not another any bind it's just loosely around her neck so it makes her feel like she's she's there but it's not where she is choking or anything like that she's got plenty of room Ali uh getting petted by Ellie Ellie be careful baby so she's petting her again she's been training good if she decides to try to kick you i pop her right here now she hadn't done it so i don't want to pop her i want her to just know that she's doing a really good job but i'll give her if she does good i'm like hey girl good job and i'll just love on her rub her belly and just kind of let her know that i she has done a great job but there's a different command than where if she starts to try to kick me or tries to put her leg in front i'll give her a gentle pop here if she doesn't do it then i'll grab back here and then that way she knows i'm trying to teach her two commands i do with her now your tail may be different and you may have different ways to train your cow but the main thing is you want to be able to say a command and she knows what you're talking about like i can say two or three commands with um with Elsa and she knows i don't like her using the restroom in the stanchion and she's learned that i can say hey she will not do it until she's done but it's because i've just steady trained her same way if Elsa's not close enough i can grab her just like i'm trying to teach Allie back here just kind of barely touch her and she'll know to step over now with Allie i've got her tight to me so she don't have to worry about trying to step over however what we're trying to do with her is just make sure she can move her leg back so you see how she's standing it's perfect for me that's exactly how i want her to stand with that left leg back just a little bit so that way i can get either the hand milk or put a pump on her and that way she's doing really good how much do you stanchion train uh you need to have your cow way before she has her baby if she's not used to you she's not going to be used to a stanchion she's not going to be used to you hand milking her even Elsa who was a milk cow and milked for a long time at a milk barn local milk barn she still took her a long time just to get used to us now she's used to us but still you want to make sure that you have your cow you love when your cow she gets to know y'all gets to know you she knows your commands and then that way you know when she's ready to start stanchion training now say she's getting ready to have a calf well i started stanchion training Allie probably about three or four months ago halfway through her pregnancy because i want her to get used to it the only time she gets feed and all this good sweet food and all this dairy pellets is only when she comes in the stanchion there's times you can ask AA you can vouch for me AA that we would not feed her and all of a sudden she'd walk in the stanchion and walk right back out well she didn't get any feed that day so we're teaching her this is a treat only when you come in to get milked and when you're good if she starts kicking and she wouldn't abide to the stanchion rule we would not keep her in here and we'd take her feed away and that way she knew for the day she messed up and she don't want to do that she's so big with this calf that she is like poking out on the ribs so i think she's doing good what do you think? i think she's going to do she might surprise us and do better than i think as long as she's eating she'll let you do anything you want to she looks like she's done great i mean we won't know until the time gets here but i think the more that we keep working with her the better she's going to do of course right four months ago i couldn't even touch her here she's run out of stanchion she has those horns which is one of our big things where she's just she's not natured as much like Elsa which was one of our concerns Elsa just she don't care what you do to her Allie's a little bit different so training Allie was very important and see we've already bought a calf halter and we're going to wrap it around here to where she is in eye view of her calf right at all times and her calf that will also help her milk come down too when we're dealing with her jerseys are notorious for holding back their milk for their calf which is where their cream is so the more they hold back the more cream we won't get so we're going to put that calf right there in front of her where she knows how important it is to let her let her full milk down we're not going to milk her fully out like we would Elsa because we want her calf to get good and fed off good jersey milk so she is putting on some weight for this calf she's not normally this big at all so but she's doing really good i'm very pleased with her again part of stanchion training is making sure you're getting comfortable with the cow but more than that the cow getting comfortable with you she needs to know your commands if a pop right here is what teaches our cow that that's wrong that's what she needs to know if grabbing her here teaches her that's what we need when we want her leg moved that's what she needs to know if we know ant is a bad command when she's trying to do things she shouldn't be doing like pulling away from the top here the V then she needs to know but she won't know that if you hadn't trained her over the last few weeks or months cows are not dumb now they can be stubborn but they're not dumb so learn to give them treats just like you would a dog or any other animal but at the same time make sure you're rewarding them taking care of them and they'll take care of you hope this video is a good little video teaches you how we stanch and train our heifers as they get ready to calf and we hope you have a good day we hope you're enjoying our content of our channel alright, what do we say Ellie? happy homesteading, y'all Thank you.
