 Capscum swarming in Kenya is a profitable venture. But many farmers struggle especially during the germination stage. With the right guidance, however, you can grow Capscum from seed to harvest and make the most of these high demand vegetables. In this tutorial, we will walk you through every step from selecting the best Capscum seeds to planting, from test control to harvesting. Now we shall cover the following topics. The Capscum market in Kenya. The best time to plant Capscums in Kenya. The best soil for Capscums farming. The best Capscum variety to grow in Kenya. How to raise Capscum seedlings. Capscums planting and spacing. Capscum fertilizer application schedule. Capscums paste and control methods. And finally Capscums diseases and how to control them. The Capscum market in Kenya. Capscums enjoy a steady demand in Kenya. Particularly in the mass market and grocery stores. Brokers absorb around 70% of the total production. Making it easier for farmers to sell in bulk and secure fast revenues. Capscums prices typically range from 30 shillings to 80 shillings per kilo. Capscums are fluctuating based on supply and demand. Capscums are highest during the times of extreme shortage. The best time to plant Capscums in Kenya. Capscums for the highest profits. Capscums ideal time to plant Capscums in Kenya is February and September. This allows you to harvest during Easter and Christmas festive season when the demand is highest. Planting these months ensures your crop are ready for harvest when the prices are peak. To maintain a steady income, ensure a continuous supply by staggering your planting and harvesting times. Buyers prefer farmers who can provide consistent deliveries regardless of the season. The best soil for Capscums farming. Before investing in Capscum farming, ensure your soil is suitable. Capscums thrive in deep, fertile, well-drained room soils. Avoid planting in fertile in fields previously used for potato or tomato farming as these crops share pests and diseases that could damage your Capscum crop. The best Capscums varieties to grow in Kenya. For better yields, choose high yield hybrid Capscum varieties. These are more resistant to diseases and pests. Here are two of the best varieties for Kenyan farmers. Number one, Maxibel. Maxibel is a popular open pollinated sweet pepper variety known for its heavy fruiting. The fruits weigh around 200 grams and each plant can yield 4 to 5 kilograms. Maxibel matures in about 90 days and has a high tolerance to tomato mosaic virus. Maxibel variety planting density or the planting population is around 900 plants per acre. The second good variety for farmers is Superbell F1. Superbell is a hybrid variety with broccoli rubs and the big fleshy fruits. It has a mild flavor and high resistance to tomato mosaic virus and potato virus. Harvesting starts 65 to 75 days after transplanting. It can yield up to 25 tons per acre. How to raise Capscum seedlings? How to raise Capscum seedlings? Seedlings establishment is where most farmers fail. Capscum seeds take 4 to 5 weeks to establish. However, this can be accelerated by soaking seeds in an optimizer or seed shooter solution before planting. Do seeds slowly and cover them with black pepper to shorten the germination period by up to two weeks. How to plant Capscum and the spacing? For best results, smears Capscum plant 45 cm by 45 cm. This allows for 20,000 plants per acre. Use well decomposed permeated manure and alleviate a thalary before transplanting. After transplanting, drench the plants with insecticides like thunder and a foliar feed like city shooter to protect against cartons and other pests. Capsicum's fertilizer application schedule. This is how you should now apply fertilizers from planting to harvesting. On 14 days after transplanting, apply DAP to promote root and foliar growth. 14 days after transplanting, apply NPK-317 to stimulate flowering. 60 days after transplanting, apply CAN fertilizer to enhance fruit enlargement. Additionally, use nitrogen, potassium, and calcium foliar fertilizers like EasyGrow Vegetative, Advanced K, and CalMax to boost plant health and fruit products. Pre-production further. Capsicum's pest and how to control them? These are the most destructive pest in Capsicum's family. Number one, lead spider mites. These are tiny pests that feed on the underside of the leaves, causing yellowing and upward curling. To control them, apply profile at the rate of 10 ml per 20 liters of water or escort at the rate of 8 ml per 20 liters of water. The second place is white fries. White fries stack nutrients from the capscab plant, hidaline photosynthesis. Infested leaves show white wax material. And to control, apply Zander or profile sexes at the rate of 10 ml per 20 liters of water. Another one is cutworms. These are paste that cut seedlings near the soil level. Drench the soil with profile at the rate of 3 ml per liter or pentagon at the rate of 1 ml per liter to control them. The other one is root knot nematodes. Nematodes cause root swelling, leading to reduced vigor and plant depth. Drench the soil with alonze at the rate of 0.5 ml per liter or marshall at the rate of 10 ml per 20 liters. Capsicum diseases and how to control them. The most destructive disease is bright. It is caused by fungus, phytophthora capsicum that leads to rapid folia, fruit and root rot. To control, apply Ridomil gold at the rate of 50 grams per 20 liters or mistrust at the rate of 30 grams per 20 liter. The best way here is to prevent the infection. The next disease is downy mildew. This disease causes yellow spots on the upper leaf surfaces and browning, leading to leaf drop and sunburn. To prevent downy mildew, apply at least Ridomil gold at the rate of 50 grams per 20 liters of water. The other disease is fuselium wilt. Fuselium wilt is caused by fuselium oxyspollum. This soil-borne fungus leads to vein clearing, yellowing and wilting. To control fuselium wilt, drench the soil with absolute average of 10 ml per 20 liters of water. Absolute is a fungicide. The other disease which is very, very critical is bacteria wilt. This bacterial disease causes wilting of young leaves and discoloration of vascular tissues. To control it, apply GreenComp at the rate of 2.5 grams per liter, which is a copper-based product. This will tend to suppress the spread of the fungus. Capscum farming in Kenya can be highly profitable. If you follow the right steps from seed selection, pest control and harvesting. With proper soil preparation, disease management and continuous harvesting, you can maximize your yields and profits throughout the year.
