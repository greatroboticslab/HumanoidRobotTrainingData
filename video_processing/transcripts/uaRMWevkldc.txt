 Unit 1 recording 14. What is agribusiness? To start with, let's define the meaning of the term agribusiness. As it becomes clear from the word structure, it consists of two concepts, agriculture and business. Business is defined in Oxford Economics Dictionary as all forms of industrial and commercial profit-seeking activity. So, combined with agriculture, agribusiness means a particular branch of economic and commercial activity involved in the raising of crops and domestic animals, manufacturing and selling of food and food products. And the next definition of business the dictionary gives is the firm conducting industrial and commercial activities. So, combined with agriculture, it implies a farm or company which produces and sells agricultural products, food and foodstuffs. So, the next sections will focus on commercial agribusinesses, their structure and types.
