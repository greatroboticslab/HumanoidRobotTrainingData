According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, in 2023, there were about 34.4 billion chickens raised globally. The majority of these chickens are pushed to lay up to 300 eggs per year under harsh conditions. A world where chickens roam free, living in harmony with nature, might sound like a far-fetched dream, but this is actually happening in some parts of China. In the mountainous regions of Guangdong province, a special method of raising chickens has existed for many years. Among the free-range chicken breeds thriving in Yangshan, the Yangshan chicken is renowned as one of the eight best chicken breeds in Southeast Asia. These chickens are muscular and easily recognized by their distinctive golden feathers. Thanks to their organic corn diet, they mature after four to five months of roaming the hills and typically weigh around 2.5 to 3 kilograms. Besides Yangshan chickens, other breeds living at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level are also raised in these highland regions. The stark difference between raising free-range chickens and caged chickens lies in their living conditions. Free-range chickens spend their lives wandering the hills, basking in the sun, and foraging for food, leading a natural life that boosts both their physical and mental health. However, they don't lay as many eggs, producing only around 100 to 120 eggs per year, and the eggs are smaller, weighing about 40 to 45 grams each. But these eggs are more flavorful and packed with omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. The chicken's active lifestyle also results in better tasting meat, which turns a bright golden color when cooked. The journey of raising mountain chickens begins with high-quality eggs from reputable hatcheries or farms. The ideal temperature for incubating eggs is around 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit, with humidity levels between 55% and 70%. It takes about 21 days for the eggs to hatch. In large-scale hatching operations, like those in Minxin County, Heilongjiang Province, China, up to 400,000 chicks are hatched each year, a significant increase from just 70,000 chicks five years ago. Once hatched, the chicks are usually transferred to well-ventilated coops. Farmers prepare the coops with 7 to 10 centimeters of sterilized straw or husks for insulation and warmth. A coop of around 3 square meters can hold about 100 chicks during their first 2 to 3 weeks. Since chicks can't regulate their body temperature effectively, constant lighting keeps them warm enough to eat and drink. Farmers provide them with clean, warm water mixed with electrolytes and 6 to 8 small meals a day. The chicks are still fragile, so farmers keep everything clean, washing the feeding troughs twice daily and giving them medicine as prescribed by a vet. Farmers are still alive. Farmers have been used to be a part of the chicken. As the chicks grow, organic food sources such as greens and grass are introduced so they can get accustomed to mountain foraging. On favorable weather days, the chickens are released to the hills early in the morning and spend most of their day there. Farmers often monitor and live stream their chickens to build an online customer base and boost sales. The hills where the chickens roam are scattered with trees, providing shade and opportunities for the chickens to perch, play, and catch insects. The chickens' diet is as varied as their environment, and during the summer, farmers hardly need to feed them since grasshoppers are abundant. Some farmers even get creative by encouraging the chickens to run more, by feeding them behind a moving vehicle. The hills where the chickens are still alive. Studies from our world and data have shown that free-range chickens experience 57% to 70% less pain and suffering, compared to caged chickens. Recognizing the benefits of free-range farming, the European Union plans to ban the use of any type of cages, by 2027. To encourage egg-laying, farmers create simple nests, from bamboo, wood, or leaves. In the mountainous regions of Tianan in northern China, more than 50,000 free-range chickens roam across 200 hectares of hills, laying eggs in around 30 chicken coops built right on the mountain tops. The coops and sleeping areas are often designed to save space and mimic the mountain terrain. fields ofお館 Possibly For picture 수민 and a small skeleton, the人 is 95% morefachated.

To ensure no eggs are missed, farmers check the crews and roaming areas twice daily to collect the eggs. Farmers with around 7,000 chickens can harvest up to 9,400 eggs per day. Despite the large quantities, manual labor and time provide information to local rural communities. After collection, the eggs go through a simple inspection and grazing process to protect the natural and immediate coating of their shells, receiving only a lifetime. Workers carefully place the eggs in a paper or plastic trays to ensure they are well protected during transport. These trays are then loaded onto trucks and delivered to local markets or pre-ordered customers. Large-scale free-range egg producers often have on-site packing facilities capable of packing up to 74,000 eggs from all nearby farms. These fresh, high-quality eggs are distributed to supermarkets and retail stores where consumers are willing to pay a premium, often from $3 to $4 per day. In comparison, page eggs may cost over $1.25 to $2 per dozen. During unfavorable weather, such as extreme heat or cold, the chickens are brought indoors to ensure their comfort and health. Inside, large groups still provide enough space for them to stretch their tents, perch on platforms, and interact with each other. A typical free-range chicken can comfortably have about 600 chickens. Some farmers prepare fresh chicken, combining local raw ingredients for meals with beef pounds and, of course, regular fresh water-based sacked chickens. The location of free-range farms is carefully selected to minimize the risk of predation. However, in some cases, natural predators such as hawks and foxes can pose a threat. To protect their chickens, farmers remove bushes and potential hiding spots for predators around the coops. They also build sturdy fences and regularly check the surrounding areas for signs of predator activity. If predators are caught, they are either sold or consumed. The exact weight of chickens at harvest varies by breed, but free-range chickens typically weigh between 1.8 and 2.4 kilograms. Although lighter than caged chickens, free-range chickens have more muscle and less fat. If you enjoyed this edition, don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe for more updates.
