 with the ever-increasing demand for food. Engineers have been diligently researching and introducing innovative agricultural machinery to officially cater to these needs. These machines are revolutionizing the way farming is done, and I will now describe and discuss some of them. What does it look like and how do they work? Right now, HyperTV will take you to see and experience them. If you find our machines interesting, please like and subscribe to continue following our next videos. First, let's take a look at the John Deere 9500i, combined harvester and the Massey Ferguson truck, working together harmoniously to harvest grass. The John Deere 9500i expertly cuts the grass and transports it into the threshing and corn harvester compartment using a blower tube. This powerful machine can handle a variety of crops such as wheat, soybeans, rice, corn, grass, straw, and many others. Moving on to another remarkable machine, the John Deere 8600i is a specialized harvester design with a robust engine boasting up to 625 horsepower thanks to its diesel engine. Equipped with an automatic steering and wheel lock system, this harvester provides ease of control while its small turning radius enables smooth movement to the ground and tight spaces. It can harvest around 300 to 400 tons of grass per hour depending on various factors like weather conditions and grass characteristics, ensuring high performance and saving considerable time and effort. For harvesting hemp fiber, the Closerian 4000 is specifically designed. The machine features a powerful MAN-D 2676 LU62 engine with a cylinder capacity of 12.4 liters. The harvesting process involves cutting the hemp stems with cutting blades and then redirecting them into the machine for further processing. Inside the machine, screens separate the leaves and branches from the hemp vessel fibers, which are collected and bundled for subsequent processing. It offers exceptional efficiency, harvesting around 8 to 14 tons of hemp vessel fiber per hectare of land, surpassing traditional machines in terms of productivity. Now, let's explore the Avent 745, a specialized device manufactured by Moptimal that excels in cutting, moving, and transplanting trees. The machine uses a cut-to-end system and a tree spade machine to safely and efficiently remove trees from the ground. It can handle trees with diameters ranging from 20 to 60 centimeters and trunk heights from 60 to 240 centimeters. Moreover, the Avent 745 supports tree transplantation, allowing for quick and precise repositioning, all while preserving the root system and growth potential of the plants. Moving on to apple harvesting, cider production in the northern region of France relies on a machine specially designed to shake ripe apples from the trees. This machine clamps the apple tree trunk securely and utilizes a vibrating mechanism with a frequency ranging from 10 to 30 hertz, ensuring that the ripe apples fall without causing damage to the trees. The vibration level can be adjusted according to the type of fruit, providing versatility and efficiency in the harvesting process. Additionally, a concentrically using structured apple harvester is used to gather apples that have fallen on the ground. This machine employs fan blades and a conveyor belt to swiftly and efficiently collect scattered apples while minimizing impact and maintaining fruit quality. In the Netherlands, beans are a crucial crop and the highly regarded Plieger EPD bean harvester plays a significant role in their harvest. This machine operates continuously, optimizing productivity by harvesting 1.5 to 3 tons of beans per hour. This machine has a lot of power. This machine has a lot of power. With advanced features and automation capabilities, it enables quick and efficient harvesting, reducing waste and costs for farmers. Carrot harvesting is made easier with the Fence 720, an advanced and efficient harvesting machine. It is equipped with a modern MAN-D836 engine, offering a maximum power output of 200 horsepower, along with smart harvesting mechanisms and improved features. The Fence 720 can harvest around 8 to 10 tons per day, depending on the type of crop. The Fence 720 has been developed. The Fence 720 has been developed. To assist farmers in harvesting oranges, an orange harvester machine has been developed. This machine offers six standing positions and facilitates the harvesting of oranges, even from heights of approximately 3 meters. It ensures convenience and speed, as it allows individuals to harvest oranges from any position without the need for extensive movement. In China, sugar cane cultivation involves spreading straw on planting ridges to keep the sugar cane moist during rinsing. A simple machine is utilized for this purpose, spreading straw on three ridges simultaneously, providing a cost-effective and efficient solution. For rice cultivation, the Case IHYH 9240 is a high-end axle-flow rice combined harvester. Powered by a 16.16-liter Cursor 16 diesel engine, it boasts a maximum power output of up to 634 horsepower. The Pro-Drive Automatic Steering System and Intelligent Control System simplify operation, increasing harvesting efficiency. The combination of an independent classification system and the AcuteGuide Automatic Steering System ensures cleanliness and accuracy during the harvest, ultimately delivering the best quality rice. With a width of 8 meters, this harvester significantly boosts productivity, allowing farmers to cover more ground efficiently. The Grass Bailing Machine has simplified the process of harvesting and preserving grass. The Equipped with a 50-kilowatt case 130 pulling head and a grass baling mechanism, this machine creates rectangular bales, each approximately 50 cm long. The Its compact design allows for easy collection and storage of grass. For land cultivation, the John Deere 8360R Tractor and Lemkin Diamond 12 Plow Set work in perfect harmony. The Lemkin Diamond Plow Set, with its 12 large plow blades and adjustable depth of up to 30 cm, ensures deep and powerful digging and tilling, effectively removing plant debris, excess materials, and hard soil clumps. With a width of up to 3.5 meters per plowing, this machine enables quick and efficient cultivation of large fields. Lastly, the Sugar Beet Harvesting Machine features large wheels and a powerful engine, allowing it to maneuver flexibly on various terrains. It cuts the grass around the rows of beets, using controllers to cut and bundle the beets together. This machine saves time and effort for workers while increasing productivity and harvest quality. With ongoing technological advancements, Sugar Beet Harvesting Machines continue to be upgraded and improved to meet the needs of farmers. These remarkable agricultural machines play a vital role in providing global food security. By improving efficiency, reducing waste, and increasing productivity, they contribute to the sustainable growth of the agricultural industry.
