 all right guys uh welcome back to this channel uh if you're new please endeavor you subscribe to this channel and uh check out for great content on this channel of everything you need to know about pig farming profitable pig farming and not just pick family alone we'll still be bringing to you lots of great content on several other agricultural venture well in this video we want to talk about uh the best breed for commercial pig farming what are the best breed you need on your farm if you're going to run a commercial pig farm this is a question on the mind of several individuals and uh because honestly i can tell you that um if you can get it right with your genetics with the right breed you are 50 good to go in your of course there are other things to still pay attention to but at least having the right genetics plays a very big role in uh in getting uh a good and a profitable pig farm now uh first of all let me start with saying that ensure that you don't buy bricks that you don't know what they are or what type of bricks they are make sure any breed you get to your farm you know exactly what they have i see that uh how there lots of people just see pigs and all that matters to them is just that these are pigs and uh these are just pigs and uh uh if pigs are pigs then we can just get them i think that's the mindset of some people obviously because you see that they just see pigs somewhere they don't know their origin they don't know their genetics and they just get them that's a very poor way to start pig farming i would never advise you to start your pig farm with any breed you don't know what they have what type of breed they have don't get diminished breed i've often said this on the farm on sorry on this channel don't get diminished breeds on your farm you are starting with on the on the wrong tone because those breeds will not convert well for you make sure you get good breeds now this right on this video i'm sure you can you can remember if you have been watching this channel you can remember uh certain uh time when we released video on these uh animals if i want you to look at their sizes you will be so surprised this is less than a month on this farm and you can see how uh robust these guys are i get are so uh they are their conversion is so much it's so massive you know i've always told you that the key to pig farming is feeding them right you need to feed your pigs right these guys they are feeding on the what we more like the creep feeds that's what they are all right here and i have told you already that when you are feeding your piglets especially your piglet you want to feed them at libidum and i explained to you you want to ensure that they always have feeds in their troughs that you can see they are just they keep eating and eating when they want to drink water they get to the nipple drinker to drink water they they go back there they they heat as much as they need to eat this is less than a month about less than a month and they are so they have they've grown so massive so to my own surprise personally so this is the african uh south african large whites right here and we got them from a very reputable sauce the woman is extremely diligent when it comes to uh uh pig farming you can if you get to our farm you would love it so much she did it very well she constructed the pens very well and she's not really growing pigs for fattening she's doing them for she sells the piglets majorly so these speaks we're getting from the farm so uh types of the best breeds for you to use on um for you on your short best breeds for commercial pig farming now the top one that is most common not just in africa in this in the in africa but even around the world the top one breed is the large white breed large white breed is so common it's so common and it's one of the exotic uh breed that uh is very good for uh commercial pig farming the large white the large white uh in another video i will tell you the characteristics of the large white but the large white uh is uh known for a very large litter size they are very prolific they give back to a lot of to lots of piglets and uh they are also you know they are strong they are they are resistant they have good resistance so people it's so common large whites are so common this also are the large right this is also the large white right here this is the large white breed we have here so i will tell you that characteristics in subsequent videos this is the large white so major majorly on the on this farm is on the large white breed now another uh the second uh breed that is extremely very good for commercial pig farm is the landrace the landrace speed is uh very good also for commercial pig farm the landrace uh and the large white i would make a video to tell you the difference between them and which one you should prefer on in in stocking in stocking them to your farm so the large white number one the landrace number two the landrace also is very prolific and as uh it's also hardy that means it's as good resistance so it's uh it's very uh advised you can get the large race on your farm now another uh breed that uh you can also get is the hampshire the hampshire breed is also a common breed that you can get now i i'm seeing more what i'm talking about here is for the african side because uh you need to understand that these breeds are majorly uh sometimes suitable based on location there are some of them that can walk in almost any location but not all of them there's certain breeds you don't want to bring to certain climates so but i'm talking from the african side of things and these are uh that's where i'm making this video from but obviously we have other different types of pig breed that may do very well in certain other areas that uh may not do well in the african side so the large white the landrace the hampshire that's uh those are three breeds that i would really advise you to think about if you want to get into uh peak farming now there's a there's one that uh i would really really advise you should consider and that's the tn70 the tn70 is one of the latest uh big breed out there and when i say latest i don't mean like yesterday but you know it's one of the recent uh modifications that occurred recently in the big farming world and uh it's a cross of both the large white and the landrace that's the tn70 and uh you can imagine taking the cross of both the large white and the landrace and see how great that breed will be the the tn70 is so massive it's so beautiful and uh very prolific so uh i would really advise that if you want to get your hand on peak farming and you're looking for what breeds to get you can consider getting the tn70 now uh another um peak breed that uh is also very very suitable for commercial peak farming is the camboro the cambro the the cambro is very or is also very massive it grows very big very very big and uh we will be stalking obviously we're stalking lots of great breeds on this farm very soon we're working on that uh one of the brits we aim to bring to this farm is the cambro the cambro we want to bring the cambro because it's also very very good when it comes to breeding it's very good when it comes to um um breeding and when it comes to fattening so you can even maintain a pure line of the cambro if you want to or you can decide to cross breed uh uh heat now many of these peak breeds i've mentioned the large white the landrace the i'm sure the tn70 the cambro one of the great thing about them is that they are very good for cross breeding purposes so you want to have these breeds if you are interested in cross breeding programs and uh if you if i will advise you on what kind of what kind of male pig you should have on your farm if you are going to be doing the cross breeding purposes well i would if you have the money i would advise you to go for the last big breed i'll be mentioning here and that's the duroc breed the duroc breed is the last um breed that i would advise you to go for commercial pig farm now i'm not sure we advise you to have uh to to go for the pure line of the drug breeds and just be breeding just the pure line alone well if you want to be selling uh to other farmers that means you want to run a breeding farm a a more like a just a like a breeding farm where you you are more interested in just selling the piglets to other farm well you can go for the drug line and just be wearing the drug alone of course there is a demand for the drug boy majorly the drug bra in this side of the world because the drug bra are very very uh excellent when it comes to uh cross breeding they are they they put in their genetics so much on other breeds that i know the one important characteristics you need to know about drug breed big big breed is that they grow fast and large you know he's wanting to grow large but take time but these guys grow large and they grow fast so they attain that level of largeness in record time so it's the reason why you may want to get them on your farm because they will pass on that trait to your cross-bred animals so on the hybrid animals you produce from maybe the duroc and the tn70 or the large white they would have that characteristic of growing very fast which is what you want if you are running a cross-breding program because you want to be able to fatten those animals in record time also like uh later six months you want to send them out of your farm so the drug breed is an excellent um boa that you should have you can have on your farm but it's on the high side it's very expensive so if you but if you don't want to use a draw breed you can use any other um big break and use the tn70 boa to meet the other on this thing or any other uh maybe the large white bra or any how you want to do it so it's uh these are the uh best breeds i will recommend for commercial pig farm in this side of the world now there's one last breed i will mention which is uprising and that's the piatran breed the piatran breed is uh is also a fast-growing pig it's uh it's more it's not so new but it's getting the limelight newly that means it's just coming into the limelight newly and not so many farms have the piatran breed but it's a breed that is getting increasingly common in this side of the world so uh um very soon i'm sure it will it will become much more common and people will be able to get them easily so this uh this will be all for the video best pig breed for commercial purposes if you want to start a pig farm a commercial pig farm you should look out for uh these breeds i've talked about to either run a pure breeding line or a cross breeding line any whichever one the program you want to make you are free to use any of these breed to do them all the breeds i mentioned are very excellent when it comes to uh reproduction they give back to a lot of piglets and they are very hardy they are resistant they have the right crosser sticks they convert well and um all these breeds i mentioned are the pure breeds obviously i'm not talking about a diminished breed the pure breeds are the ones i'm referring to here and i would not advise you to run a duroc pure line uh because obviously you may if you are going to be fattening for the market because if you're not going to be selling the offspring to the to to the uh other farmers you don't want to because you may not be able to sell at the price that the uh the matured on duroc will come out with you may not be able to get buyers for that in the market you know i mean in the slaughterhouse so i'm not saying everywhere in the world i'm talking about this side of the world because other sides of the world the drug breed is more common that means you can easily get the drug breed but in this side of the world is not yet as common so it's still more like a very expensive animal so if you are wearing the drug breed for market purpose it may not pay you so much because you may not be able to sustain that uh the the price is to be going out with but again if you desire that it's still out to you thank you very much uh if you're new to this channel
