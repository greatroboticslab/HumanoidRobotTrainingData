 Greetings people of Earth. It's me Andrew with another super interesting video. I've got a job I want to do today. That Russian vine back there on a tacky. But first things first, let's let the animals out. All right girls. You want to come out? All right ladies, let's open them up and get them out. Combination. There we go. Open, open. Combination. Come on girls. Come on ladies. Oh one's missing. One two three four five six seven. Where is she? She must be laying an egg. All right ducks. All right ducks. All right ducks. All right. I'm doing it. I'm doing it right now. Here they come. Here they come. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Gotta do the brick. Do the brick. Come on girls. Here they go. Here they come. Happy to be out. Here they come. Straight into the pond. You'll notice there used to be that green mesh across there. I've removed that so that I can get in there when it's not too busy with the bees and I can stop pulling up all that grass without having to trip over it. Makes the whole pond area look much nicer. I've got it hung up. That green mesh there used to be over there. There's Zeus. Big boy. All right. Let's see where the other chicken is. Any eggs? Yeah, I know the GoPro doesn't like the dark. Is she in there? Oh, yes she is. She's in there. Let's check this box. Nothing today. Nothing in there today. Ah, you savage. Let's have a little nose. That's scaring her off. Oh, oh, I scared her off. Sorry. I'll take the egg though. Thank you very much. I think it was the white hand. Where is she? Here, our precious. Sorry to disturb you. Let's check the ducks. The duck eggs. There's usually two inside here. Not one today. Just the one. Don't drop it. Put it on the ground so you don't drop it. All right. Go on girls. Run away. Run away. Well, let's go open up the shed and then I'll explain this job I want to do, which is that. See all this vine? It's called a Russian vine. And it's like, it's going a bit crazy. I'm not too bothered about the top, but every time I try and walk past this, it tries to strangle me. And there's no fun. So I need to... I need to hack some of that down. Hold on a second. Let me just open up the shed door. Latch. Put these eggs down first. Don't want them breaking in my pocket. One there. One there. Let's have a look. Oh wow. Okay, so this Russian vine, right? Have a look. This is where it's rooted. All that. And then I built this little trellis thing that comes up, it comes up, it comes up here. And then it used to be, I mean this whole thing used to be a lot smaller, the actual Russian vine. And but at the top of the trellis, I've got it split off. So there's one that goes across there to this side of the door. And there's three beams. And that was like the first initial part. It then started growing over in that direction. So I had to build this other little extension. You can see the three beams. I don't know why I'm making the whole triangle thing, but that's just how it came. Or how it ended up. And I started building it. But it used to come all the way over to this pole. But this whole framework was really loose and rotting, starting to fall apart. So put this one in the ground. Yeah. With a new wire frame all the way across. And then we're going to get rid of the one in the front. But now this is all overhanging. And I don't really want to hack all this off. Yeah. So today's mission. If I've got enough wood, I have to go and check my little stash. And see if I've got pieces long enough. I want to attach a beam over here. Can you see that up there? To that corner. Well, I don't know what I'm going to do yet. Because I'm not sure if I've got enough pieces of wood. And then I want to lift all of this up. If I can build the framework to this corner, I'll be able to put this on top of the framework. I've got some leftover... See what I mean? I keep strangling me. I've got some leftover chicken wire. Which I can put on top of any framework that I can build here. But I don't have a... A post in the ground here. I'll make a plan. I'll make a plan. But all that which has fallen over, raise it up so that we get this really cool canopy that grows over. This way. And you can see here this little piece of string. It's what's holding up this framework at the moment. Because this is rotten. At the bottom. This is all... It's all rotten. And it's mostly being held up by this plant which is a honeysuckle. See? Pretty little flower. So that's what was holding it up. But just over the years, man. Wood rots. Over the years, wood rots. It's... Okay. So I'm going to... I've got a few other things to do first. But I'm going to come back and have a look. See if I've got enough wood. I'll get all my bits and pieces together. I'll get set up. Go home. I've got to charge my batteries for my drill. And then... I don't see them. Amongst all this, I've got to try and find some pieces of wood that are long enough to do that framework thing that I just kind of explained. Very badly. Runaway chicken. Yes, April. Yeah. It rained all of yesterday. So I didn't do anything yesterday. But today I want to do that. And then if I extend you up... Let's have a look if we can do this. Yeah, it's getting there. So let's have a look. You can see on top where the soda panel is. I need to get up there and cut all of the Russian vine that is slowly growing towards it. I also need to bring up the ladder so that I can get up there and start hacking away with the Zacateas. So yeah, that's the job today. I'm going to come back and get that sorted hopefully. See you just now. Okay. From your perspective, I didn't go anywhere, but I've already been out and I've come back. And I've kind of got all my tools and stuff all together. My bits and pieces. I found some wood which I'm going to use. I've got a nice piece here. Oh man, I've been all over. I've already cut some blocks pre-cut. And I kind of have an idea of what I'm going to do, but I'm pretty much just freestyling it as I go. So yeah, let's just make this up as we go. I'm going to position you there. Not taking any chances this time, you're going to be safe and stable. I'm going to position you right there and hopefully just forget about you until I'm on the other side of the shadows. So yeah, enjoy. there had a nice34 as well. It is now all the same but I'm a little bit too kept, and then I have to deal with you. And I don't know. Okay? I'll put a little bit now. Oh no. There's no way there is. And I've got a little bit now. And a little bit there. It looks cool when when we're going to have the 200 and more stride road, but I'll be kind of going to get it under. The好 greely, the one that you are going to spend six hours days that are going to pass across the two skyline s pharmaceuticals, but here The Dropside is bidding on It's not a �nemouth corner because you have an attraction. So this year, it works pretty much throughout the United States. This year bou为cha's guild, here's got a huge. I just poked myself. I don't bleed. I'm not doing a professional job here. That is not professional. Come check. Look at my skewness. So, supported that one in there. I know it's not the right way to do it, but it's done. Up there, got that beam across to that one. And then this side, sorry, I'm taking you in circles. Up there to that one. And you can see how epically straight that is. And this is the screw that just got me, because I did not, I did not screw that in. I should fix it, actually. Hold on. Let me fix that. That's a terrible job. Absolutely terrible. Let me jump up there and fix that one. Now hold on. Extending you out to tilt you back further. There we go. Next thing. Much better. Let me show you the difference. You see it now? On screen. It's not coming out of the center of the beam. The screws I'm using are way too long. But, never mind. Okay, that's the basic framework up. Kind of. Kind of. Got to put in a few more support beams. Probably wasn't angled right before, but now it is. Oh well. Now it is. Even when you make mistakes, right? Can you see me? From your mistakes. Most of the time. Most of the time you will learn from your mistakes. Angle better. Unless you're a complete idiot, then you'll never learn. Which is me sometimes. I think. From your perspective. Oh yeah, that looks perfectly skew. Oh yeah, that looks perfectly skew. Oh yeah, that looks perfectly skew. Oh yeah, that looks perfectly skew. Come on. How does it smell? which might be better than far from running but I would whisk as much as more withидs Come check, it's the first one. So, can you see that? If I go into the darkness, there's the first bit of mesh. I'm going to flick all this on top of it once I get the other piece up. But I'm not going to bother nailing it down. All I've done is I've just pinched it. So it's not going to slide anywhere. And over time, the old Russian, the Russian vine will eventually, it'll hold it in place anyway. We're on this side. So, I just pinched it. Pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch. All the way along. I mean, it's already, it's not going anywhere. That piece was the perfect length. Let's see if I get lucky the second time. It's got a whole bunch down there. I'm thinking this one. This is all from the old rabbit hutch that I had. I wonder if this piece is going to be... This looks like it might be the piece. Okay, let me put you down. Whatever, look. I got a perfect angle. Perfect angle. Let's just take the big one. Can I... You know? Okay. Never mind. I'll just put this... I'll just put this one up. And then I can cut it off later with my wire cutters. Because the creeper... Yeah, it's not really going to reach this half. So let's flip it that way. Okay, let's take a big one. I'll just put this one up. And then I can cut it off later with my wire cutters. Because the creeper... Yeah, it's not really going to reach this half. So let's flip it that way. I'll just put this one up and then I can cut it off later with my wire cutters because the creeper, yeah it's not really going to reach this half. So let's flip it that way. I don't have to cut anything off I'll just overlap it. It's working. Okay, we're going to have to cut this one off. Man, that's sons and I. Okay, I'm going to turn you off for a second. I'll turn you back on when I'm finished because that's going to take a while. Done. Cut all that. I'm just going to crimp it over. Once the creeper grows over it, I'll be keeping it trimmed about here. You won't see any of those imperfections. I didn't have the proper wire cutters. If I had the proper wire cutters, I could have... But I'm using long nose cutters, so I've got to put all of that all the way in just to get to the cutter part. The wrong tool for the job. Now, on this side. Now we're going to try the fun part. Hopefully the GoPro can see what I'm doing in the darkness. I'm just going to put you on the floor, extend you up. Tilt your back. Nope. Tilt your back. I'm going to attempt to push all of this onto the mesh that I've just put up. Okay, so please don't fall over. Stay still. Oh, the battery's going down. 36%. It's really looking better. So I've got that up. I need to put a beam across from this corner all the way to the other side of this to hold all of that up. But I don't have enough wood long enough. I need like... It's got to be a metre and a half. Um... But that's... That's working so far. That is working. Um... I've got to try and find a piece of wood. Uh... Oh man, I've gone brain dead. This is my brain dead face. Uh... I don't know what I'm doing. Um... Ah well, instead of just being stupid, let's go have a look. That piece is too short. Um... I don't know what I'm doing. Um... I don't know what I'm doing. Um... Oh man, I've gone brain dead. This is my brain dead face. Uh... I don't know what I'm doing. Um... Um... Ah well, instead of just being stupid, let's go have a look. That piece is too short. That piece will work, but it's really heavy... Maybe. Hey, there's a big chunk here. Let's have a look. This is a proper, proper piece of wood. Um... We'll have a look. Yeah, you can kind of... Have a look. See that? That's my little contraption that I've built so far. It's not supposed to look pretty. Although it would be better if it was. But it's just supposed to be effective. That's all. If I'd built this all from the beginning, using the right... The right tools and all the right timber, I would have done it nice from the beginning, but... I've been doing it in stages. And because I'm doing it in stages with off cuts of pieces of wood, That's what it looks like. Um... Eh, that's fine. Okay. Let's position you here. On the ladder. Looking up in that direction. Let's see. Let's see if I can get this big chunk. Oh, that's fine. I've been on. I've been on. I've been on. I've been on. I've been on. I've been on. I've been on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oop. Hey. That actually worked. I might need to put a screw in that side. This one's not going anywhere. Check. So that one, I could probably put a screw in there to hold that in place. But this one, this is the beam. That's just sitting there. That's not going to go anywhere. And all this stuff is going to hold it in place. So look at the difference. Didn't have to trim it off. Just needed to push it up. Okay. Okay. I'm pleased with that. Let's see if we can get a screw in the other side. Yep. I'm going to climb up. Oh, excuse me. Through those bushes and try and drill the screw in. I'm going to go in there now. I'm going to try and push up as much as I can. I'm going to go in there now. I'm going to try and push up as much as I can. I'm going to go in there now. I'm going to go in there now. I'm going to go in there now. I'm going to go in there now. I'm going to try and push up as much as I can. I'm going to go in there now. I'm going to go in there now. I'm going to go in there now. I'm going to try and push up as much as I can. I'm going to go in there now. I'm going to go in there now. I'm going to try and push up as much as I can. I'm going to try and push up as much as I can. I need to get a screw in the one piece of wood. so it doesn't fall out. I've got a few screws to put in and I'm basically done. I could use different ones for these. I've only got massive screws, but I need shorter ones. Can you see what I'm doing? Come here. I want to put... I'll see if the wood is loose, which I put up that side. That's where I screwed it. I'm going to put a screw in here. And then this little... I don't know if you can see that one. That little junction point. And then that will fill up that gap. The vine itself does a pretty good job of holding itself up. I've got wire mesh on this one when I first did it. I've got a little bit of a screw in here. And this side, even though it looks pretty nice, it looks very nice. Once the creeper goes over it, it's going to look awesome. It's going to look really awesome. It's going to look really cool. OK. So for now, see if I can just put a screw in there. All right. I know you can't see that but the battery is running low and I need to just get this done And you are not standing still, all right You refuse to stand still you stand here then this is drop you down a bit. Here we go All right Come with me So This camera's battery is down to 16% I'm not sure what the point it cuts off for set bugs for safety and stuff So I'm gonna just fuck off bugs Flying in my eyes I'm gonna have to do the trimming of this side Another day Let me show you from here Man there's bugs flying in my face So I'll do all the trimming and stuff another day Because I'm getting I'm actually getting fed up now I've had enough But I'll show you what I've done one more time And then we'll switch it off for the battery Okay So All of that Was once dangling this side This side I built this little framework I've got a framework With some chicken wire mesh Very basic framework It's not It's not level It's not straight It doesn't have to be It's just got to stop the creeper The creeping vine Excuse me From drooping down I might come up here With the proper cutters And just trim off all this ugliness here Just to make it a bit better Because it's not completely square I mean this gap Is wider Than this gap That's why there's so much overhang Bundled up there And nothing over here You see how it all bundles up It's not square It doesn't matter But overall I'm happy with it I mean considering I've just been Completely freestyling it As I go I mean I I did all this initial stuff When I was still kind of An amateur I'm still an amateur What am I talking about When I was more of an amateur Oh that reminds me I need to put A little wooden block here And a little wooden block Here Same as that one So that when this thing Gets really heavy It doesn't just fall down Because at the moment It's only held in with water One screw And one screw Into the fascia Which is That's a complete noob Noob move So We'll get a block in like this one Because then it's We'll be able to handle the weight And yeah There's another project This is going to be a long video I'm going to have to do some editing And Barry Allen speeding up And cutting out parts And whatever Thanks for watching See you on the next one Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers To To عiu Tim Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Cheers Barry Allen Tour
