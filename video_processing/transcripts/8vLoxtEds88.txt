 In cultivated plots, part of the biodiversity is detrimental for production. We have attackers, the destructive biodiversity made of parasites, viral diseases, fungal diseases, bacterial diseases, predators, birds, rats, worms, caterpillars, and all kinds of agricultural plagues. And competitors, such as other plants, which decrease the yield of cultivated crops. Now, the wide diversity of attackers, which are illustrated here, we have the fruit worm on mails, nematodes on bananas, diseases on sugarcane, drosophila being attacked by ants on mango fruit, and also white worms attacking the roots of maize, disease on cocoa, plants. All these aggressors, attackers are a problem for agriculture and farmers. And they account for a huge potential loss or even observed loss. This table shows you the various types of attackers, fungi, bacteria, viruses, animals, other plants. And the losses, potential losses are huge. The total decrease of production due to these four categories of attackers may reach 67%. Two-thirds of the crop may be lost versus a similar situation without the attackers. Now, agriculture for a long time has focused on how to best control or even eliminate the attackers. At the bottom, on the bottom line, we see the efficacy of a possible fight against attackers in percentage. We never will be able to eradicate the attackers, limiting the yield of crops, but we have ways to reduce the attacks. In modern agriculture, however, the best way consists in using, or the most efficient ways consists in using biocides, pesticides, targeting this or that attacker. Industrial agriculture and agriculture in the green revolution countries, intensive, single species with a high use of fertilizers, invest a lot in pesticides. And they use huge quantities of fungicides, pesticides. The chemical turnover represents $40 billion in this field. So it's a huge cost for agriculture to try and eliminate or mitigate the action of parasites. There is a paradigm on which agricultural production is based. It's all about eradication. An attacker is a limiting factor. It decreases the yield. We use a biocyte to try and eliminate the attacker. But by doing this, we forget about the wealth of ecosystemic services present both in the cultivated plot and all around the cultivated plot. I think it is high time we thought about other ways to fight against parasites and attackers. Because abundant use of pesticides obviously has a negative impact on both the producers' and farmers' health, on the consumers' health. We have reason to worry that the use of pesticides by farmers, especially in developing countries where safety rules are not really complied with. We have a huge public health problem. And obviously pesticides leave residues on the produce whereby the consumers are also in danger and the whole ecosystem is in danger. Toxicology of the pesticides in the environment is really a source of worry. The man who invented DDT and got the Nobel Prize about 80 years ago. And ever since, we have come a long way to understand that it's now absolutely necessary to limit the use of pesticides. The eco-phytoplank, for example, is the eco-phytoplank in France, which aims at dividing by two the use of pesticides within a few years' time, is being implemented. It's in progress, except it's very difficult to control the pests and attackers differently. Research producers, all of the agricultural industry, are looking for new ways to control pests and attackers and diseases. There is a very good example of a new way to achieve this result. The use of vegetal biodiversity present on the plot and around the plot. On the left-hand side, you see agrochemistry. Everything used by industrial agriculture to get rid of attackers, mainly pesticides. The efficacy is specific. It limits the efficacy of bio-attackers for one campaign, maybe two campaigns, or three, until the bio-attacker finds a way to resist the pesticide and develops resistance. But it also has an impact on production and yield is high, except that an excessive use of pesticides may lead to a very unfavorable situation. Bananas plantations in Central America require 50, 60, 70 treatments a year. Almost once a week, an airplane has to spread pesticides on the plantation. You can imagine the problem this entails. On the right-hand side, we have ways to fight attackers by the use of biodiversity, a specific vegetable diversification. There are very specific examples showing that one may achieve unfavorable impact on human health and environmental health, with different methods than spreading poisons in the environment. This can be achieved through beneficial organisms which fight the attackers, or parasitoids, or parasites, or pests which attack the original pests. And this also will have a beneficial effect on soil fertility and biological activity in the soil. And finally, there are some spectacular effects on economy and yield with this new way to eliminate attackers. I'll give you one example on how to use a vegetable diversity in order to get rid of a pest that attacks a maze in Africa. This system was developed by ICP in Africa. It's called the push-pull system. Push as in pushing, pull as in pulling, attracting. There is a type of moth and worm that attacks maize and may reduce by 80% of crop yield. Now, this moth, fruit worm, lays its eggs on the cob. The larvae go into the cob and destroy the maize. The system is a push-pull system whereby all around the plot a plant will be planted simply to provide the service. It attracts the female moths looking for a place to lay their eggs. And this plant is toxic for the female moth. The moth deposits its eggs on this type of grass and the eggs will not develop. They'll be intoxicated. This is the pool system attracting the moths. And in order to reinforce the system between the stalks of maize, this medium is planted. And this medium is a plant that pushes away the female moth. And therefore, the moth population looking for a place to lay their eggs are pushed away by this plant. They don't like it. This is a very simple, relatively cheap system to push away the parasite out of the plant, attracting it outside of the plot to eliminate it with a toxic plant. There are other advantages because the desmodium planted between the maize stalks is a leguminous plant which is going to provide nitrogen and fertilize the soil. Tree of charge. And the desmodium, some species of desmodium, have an allelopathic effect on striga seeds. The striga is a plant which is a parasite for maize. And the desmodium will kill the striga seeds when they germinate. So it's a way to engineer biodiversity in order to control a parasite moth or fruit worm. And this system is now being used by tens of thousands of producers and farmers in Africa. This family of systems, this push-pull system, has been adapted in other systems. A system that allows to push away the parasites and attract them to a different place, in a trap where they will be naturally eliminated, was developed by CIRAD for... ...vegetable growing companies or farms. And this way to fight parasites is accessible for small producers, relatively cheap, and it doesn't have a negative impact on the environment. We are finally realizing that we don't need to think in terms of a prescriptive way to eliminate parasites with a pesticide. Same way that a pharmacist or a doctor would make a diagnosis and give you a prescription to go and buy the drug. Now we have to rethink the whole system. And there are other such-like examples, the biological fight against the pest, extraction of natural substances for some products in order to spread them on the cultivated plants. And even plants that sanitize the environment. Remember I told you about the banana. Well, in order to fight against nematodes and weevil infestation, there is a plant that will limit nematodes and limit weevil populations. And that will go from 15, 20 treatments in the French West Indies on banana plantations and divide the number of treatments by three. This is better for the consumers, better for the producers, and obviously it's also a better way and a more economic way to fight attackers. And we will like through this. We will find�� xem this character . Oh yeah I will find that if I will walk so vue�� networks. It's okay. Yeah that's okay. Right here when you look at it I can feel like really nice, man. Oh yeah Ha Mead! A little bit more and a bit more and a bit more because I learned this aprender.
