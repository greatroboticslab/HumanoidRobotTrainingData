Science & Technology
 Hey, my name is Jim Horman and we're going to talk about the biology of soil compaction. We've got a few problems here this morning, but I understand this may go off at noon, so I'm going to speed it up just a little bit. You know, when we talk about ideal soil composition, roughly 50% of the soil is what we call solid material. About 45% of that is the mineral portion, and in an ideal soil we have about 5% organic matter. A lot of farmers don't know this, but as much as 50% of the soil can actually be pore space, however, when we compact the soil, a lot of times we don't have that much. So let's take a look at a compacted soil and look at some different bulk densities. If you look at an uncultivated, undisturbed woodlot, typically the bulk density is anywhere from 1 to 1.2 grams per centimeter cubed. And what we're looking at is we're looking at the weight and basically the weight over a volume of soil. And so that would be ideal. If we had 1.2 grams per centimeter cubed, that would be an ideal soil. We have about 50% pore space in that. But as we get into cultivated clays and cultivated sandy loams, you'll notice that the bulk density increases, and that means we have less room for air and water to move. And so if you look on my right-hand side there at the bottom, once we reach a bulk density of 1.6 grams per centimeter cubed, it starts to become root limiting. That's somewhere around 250 pounds per square inch. We get up to 1.8, and then the roots are totally restricted, and the roots can't get through there. So that's real important on a lot of our soils. We're actually limiting the roots and how deep they can go. So let's take a look at what is typical in our soils. We generally talk about the plow layer, and this may be anywhere from 7 to 8 to 9 inches deep. And you'll notice that we have, as we plow that soil, the bulk density goes down. It's like around 1.4. And then we reach this limiting layer there about 7, 8, 9 inches deep, where it's very hard for the roots to get through the soil. We've seen this in almost all the soils that we've looked at. There's a limiting layer there, and a lot of times, especially on corn roots, they'll go off at a right-hand angle, also on soybeans. So what we're doing with the cover crops and the no-till is we're trying to break up these compaction zones. The very fine roots can get through planes of weakness, and they can decrease that bulk density so that our main crop, the grain crops, can get deeper into the soil to get moisture and also nutrients. Soil organic matter, if you look at some of the characteristics, why we want to increase soil organic matter contact, look at the bulk density of soil organic matter. It's about 0.6 compared to, say, 1.45, somewhere in that range for where we have a tilled soil. So soil organic matter has less density in the soil, has more room, and has more space for air and water storage. And here's an important characteristic. Every pound of soil organic matter can hold 18 to 20 pounds of water. That's why we like to say that soil organic matter acts like a sponge. And here's a picture of that. You can see the little black areas in there. If you look at soil organic matter, it's not nearly as dense. The color tends to be light to dark brown, and it has room to store water and also to store nutrients. You'll also notice that the surface area is quite large. So that allows water to get trapped in between those particles. It also gives structure to our soils. When we look at a compacted soil, the density could be between 1.6 to 1.8. Compacted soils kind of have a much higher density, less room for air and water storage. They tend to act like roads or road pavement. They a lot of times result in flash floods. It was interesting this year. We had a drought. We had a couple of one-inch rains, but the majority of that water ran off the soil surface, even though the soil was extremely dry. It's because we turned that soil into road pavement. And I like to say, you turn it in whenever you do excessively till the soil, you turn it into a road pavement. We've all probably seen a farmer, maybe your neighbor, really till the soil. What happens when they till it and get it very fine? As soon as it rains, it turns into concrete. And so dense soils also have less microbial life, and that's really important for nutrient management. Here's an electron microscope of some of the clay minerals. This is where the water and the nutrients can be trapped. Generally, this clay mineral will put an organic film around there, and the nutrients get trapped in between the soil organic matter and the minerals that are in the soil. Three soil compaction factors. We all know that heavy equipment, due to its weight, will compact the soil. But did you know that rain and gravity will also compact the soil? We can have rainfall. When it comes down, it can reach a terminal velocity of 35 miles per hour. It almost looks like a mini nuclear explosion when it goes off. So that can move soil and water, but it also tends to have a compacting factor. Is there a visual way to measure soil compaction? And actually, you can go on your farm, and you can probably see this. If you look at a fence row and look at the elevation difference between your field and where that fence row is. We've measured this in Ohio. Some said that this was due to wind. Others said that a lot of the soil had eroded and had piled up in a wind row. But actually, we've measured this on the lee side of the woods. And we saw anywhere from a 6 to 9 inch elevation difference. If 50% of that is void space, that equals an additional 3 to 4 1‚ÅÑ2 inches of additional water that we could store in that soil. If you really want to see this, if you've got a wooded area, you can see the difference. Here in northwest Ohio, a lot of times the woods that we had were actually very low. And that's where the water stood. Now, often the water is standing on the headlands. And we can see water standing there. It's because that soil is much more compacted. Here's the water available. The available water capacity of soil organic matter. That first inch of additional soil organic matter can gain you anywhere from 1 to almost 2 inches of additional water. If we get it up to 5 inches or 5% soil organic matter, you can see we're gaining on a sandy soil 2.5. On a sandy loam, 4 inches. And on a sandy clay loam, 3 inches of additional water. So it starts off at 1 to 2 inches of water per foot of soil. And after we get up to about 5% organic matter, we're down to about a half to 0.8 inches of additional water for every 1% organic matter that we're adding to that soil. This is extremely important in dry weather or in climates that don't have a lot of rainfall. Here's what happens. We've talked about this. Where we've got a compacted or tilled soil, it tends to set up like the road. Where we have good vegetation throughout the year, we increase that pore space so it slows down the water runoff and it increases water infiltration. Here's what happens if we speed up or double the velocity of water. The relationship is 2 to the 6th power for every time you double the velocity of water. This tells you how many more nutrients that that water can carry. The faster the water flows, the more energy it has. So if I go from 1 to 2 mile per hour, I can carry 64 times more nutrients. If I get up to 16 to 32 mile per hour in a flowing stream, I can carry 1,000 times more nutrients with that water. So what we're trying to do now is we're trying to slow the water down so that it drops its load, keeps the nutrients in the soil rather than running off. We have a lot of problems with hypoxia and eutrophication. Hypoxia is too much nitrogen and phosphorus getting into the Gulf of Mexico. Eutrophication is mainly where we've got too much phosphorus causing a lot of algae blooms. For water uptake, if you're looking at where the roots absorb most of the water, it's in that top half. If you look at each one of these lines, it's about 6 inches. So 40% of the water by that plant is absorbed within the top 6 inches. The next 6 inches will absorb about 30%. So 70% of the water is absorbed in the top foot. This kind of explains why corn can actually do quite well with maybe only 8 to 9 inches of rooting depth before the roots start going off a right angle. It actually has almost 70% of the water. But if we can get those roots to go a little bit deeper, especially in a dry year, we can gain another 20 to as much as 30% more water as we get into that subsoil. Same thing goes for nutrient extraction. Exact same relationship, 40, 30, 20, and 10. And you can see the depths there. So same relationship. Also, when we look at a soil, there's a big difference between no-till with a cover crop where we have live plants. Notice the temperature difference. It's about 87 to 85 degrees. Over here where we have conventional and maybe we have started to try to do no-till, you'll see that there's at least a 20 to maybe as much as a 30 degree increase in the temperatures. This year, when we had a drought here in Ohio, we measured soil temperatures up around 130 to as high as 140 degrees Fahrenheit. And what impact does that have? Notice here the soil bacteria start to die at 140 degrees Fahrenheit. We get our best moisture somewhere where the soil is around 70 to 95 degrees. Once it gets over 95, notice we're only using at 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 15% of the moisture is used for growth. 85% of the moisture is lost through evaporation and transpiration. So if we can keep that soil covered with live plants and keep a nice layer of residue on there, we can conserve moisture. And that's the key thing that I wanted to talk to you about. Also, for hot, dry summers, how much more water do we need when the temperature goes up? At 75 degrees Fahrenheit, we need about one inch of water per week. Raise that by 10 degrees. We need two inches. Raise that by another 10 inches. And now we're up to four inches of water a week. So your water requirements double for every 10 degree increase in temperature. Heat and drought together, they're linked together. They quickly increase yield losses in your soil. This information came from Dr. Elwin Taylor out of Iowa. If we look at the soil and look what's going on, when we do subsoil tillage, where we add an extremely large amount of oxygen into the soil, it acts like a firmus, almost like a wood stove, you might say. Adding oxygen to the soil actually causes the soil organic matter to go up into the atmosphere. So we start to lose soil organic matters. And the more aggressive your tillage, the more soil organic matter losses you're having. Matter of fact, in the last 50, 25 years, once tillage starts, you'll see that you will lose as much as 50% organic matter. In some places, we've seen as much as 60% losses in soil organic matter. Notice, though, that once we started doing permanent sod and adding, we can start to add organic matter back to that soil. But you notice that we didn't reach the same level. You might want to think about that. Why didn't we get back up to where we were? And the answer to that is quite simple. It has to do with the amount of roots and how tall we let that grass grow. We tend to, on our permanent sods, we'll cut off the top growth. Top growth is related to root growth. The more root growth you have, the more healthy that plant is, the more organic matter you're going to add to your soil. Matter of fact, most of the organic matter in the soil comes from the roots. As much as 65% to 70% of the organic matter comes from roots. So the more roots we get into the soil, the higher our soil organic matter levels. Let's talk a little bit about compaction. Here's a typical tire. You'll notice as you're putting weight on that soil, the forces are down. And then what actually happens is the soil moves to the side and will actually get kind of a lip there around that rut. You'll see that the soil is actually forced upward. And so what happens then, if we take, say, a disc and we try to take that lip off and we try to fill in that hole, you'll always notice when this happens that you never quite fill it in. And why is that? Because we're losing the void space. When you break up the soil and you lose all your soil structure, you have less room for air and water. And so what we're doing is we're breaking the soil down and the mineral portion is very solid, very dense. And so what we need to do is now lift it up and keep it in shape. We need to have better soil structure. And one of the ways we can do that is with a root. You might see this root here. It's expanding the soil. Where that man is pointing, you'll notice that when this big oilseed radish, these can get as big as your leg and get anywhere from three to four feet deep in the soil, although mostly the tuber is at the soil surface. But what it does is as it goes down and it expands, it's forcing the soil down, forcing it to the side, and it's physically lifting it. And so what roots actually do is they actually compact the soil, but they reordinate the clay particles. And then what they do is they form aggregates. So we're going to take some of the polysaccharides and the exodus that come from these roots, and we're going to form nice aggregates, which will give us some structure back to our soil so that our soil doesn't collapse on us and it's not quite as dense. Here's what the bacteria do. Ninety percent of the bacteria are linked to the clay. Forty to sixty percent of the soil microbial biomass is associated with this clay, and that's how we form something called a microaggregate. And what we do is we take these microaggregates, which are less than 250 microns, and we're going to form macroaggregates. Now if you want to know what a macroaggregate looks like, when you go home, just take your shovel in your lawn, dig up some soil in your lawn, and then shake the turf a little bit. And you'll see these, what I'd say, pea-sized, small pieces, almost the size of a small piece of gravel, little pads. Those are the macroaggregates that are forming. So what we're doing is we're allowing that soil to start to set up so it has more structure, so it has more room for air and water. And by doing that, we can store more air and water in that soil, and it's less dense. And one of the key fungus that we have in the soil are these mycorrhizal fungus. They actually infect 80 percent of our plants, and they give off something called glomalion or glomulin, some people call it. That's what gives us some of the glycoproteins and some of the, it's a structure that helps to cement soil together to form these macroaggregates. And here's what mycorrhizal fungus look like. You'll notice on the top we have this brown root. The fungus are actually either white or yellow. And in a handful of soil, we can have as much as 20 to 25 miles of these filaments going into the soil. What these fungus do is they bring back water, nitrogen, and phosphorus to the plant. In exchange, the plant is going to feed that mycorrhizal some of its carbohydrates. As much as 25 to 40 percent of the total carbohydrate reserves in the root go to feed these fungus if they're available. It's a very beneficial relationship. And then when these fungus die, they give off this glomulin that's inside their cell structure. It's kind of sticky. It's kind of like a glue. That helps to glue our soils together. So we want to keep these mycorrhizae healthy. They need to have live plants year-round in order to do that. Tillage and excess fertilizer tend to kill off the mycorrhizae of fungus. And here's what happens. This shows that sticky substance being surrounded. It surrounds those soil particles, and that's what gives us those nice macro aggregates that we were talking about. Building soil structures like building a house, it starts with Mother Nature. Our carpenter is our plants. And we're going to start with this sand, silt, and clay. The roots are kind of like how we would frame up a house. Some of the nails and the lag screws, this humus is very hard, very tough. It's been around for hundreds, thousands of years. It's been broken down, so it sticks around. But what we're really lacking in the soil is some of that glumalion or some of that active carbon. Some of the polysaccharides are missing. The nitrogen and the sulfur also act like braces. And then that surface residue, that's kind of like the roof on your house. So here's a picture of a house. And see how we start. Let's take a look at how we build this house. We start off with the foundation. We add the wood. And so look around the room where maybe you're sitting at. Notice that there's a lot of space in a building like this or in a house. The reason we have that is because the wood or the soil organic matter in the soil is giving structure. And the nitrogen and the sulfur are acting like braces. And now we've got room for air and water to move. The light screws, I like to say, is how soil organic matter attaches to the clay particles. And a lot of times we'll have phosphorus. We'll have some other nutrients in between there that will attach that clay particle and that organic matter together. The humus, again, is like nails. And then this glomulin kind of acts like the glue or house wrap. It helps to insulate this house. And then the roof helps to keep on a roof on a house. It will help keep out water. What's interesting, in the soil, the roof actually acts to help keep out too much oxygen. Imagine what would happen if we had a tornado come through on your house. And every other year took your roof off. We'd get too much water in there. And that water would start to rot out the wood. And pretty soon, this whole house would cave in. In the soil, if we get rid of the residue, we get too much oxygen into the soil. And it burns up the soil organic matter. And the whole house starts to compact. It starts to decay. And everything falls in. It works the exact same way in the soil. Too much oxygen. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are opposed to each other. When one increases, the other decreases. So carbon dioxide is heavier than the oxygen. So they're inversely related. So if we get a heavy rain where we have a microaggregate, you're not going to get as much water infiltration. And a lot of the water will run off. One of the things that farmers have talked to me about is saying, you know, I've been in no-till for five or ten years. And some farmers will say that my soils are cold and wet. Other farmers who have been in no-till will say my soils are warm and moist. So which one is right? Well, actually, let's take a look at this. Probably when you started into no-till, did you get rid of all the soil compaction? And so that's probably one of the reasons why our soils are cold. Compacted soils hold more moisture. So coming out of the winter, we're going to have water which holds the cold. It'll hold the cold and the heat. And so your soils will tend to be wet, and they'll also tend to be cold. So as you start to get into no-till and you start to break up that soil and get more macropores to get the water to drain from your soils, that soil will start to warm up quicker. Matter of fact, you've probably seen this in your own home. Window panes a lot of times are triple, double or triple, and they use air as an insulation. So now when you start going, let's say you've been in no-till for one to two years, you're starting to get more residue at the surface. What is the color of residue when it breaks down? It actually turns black, and does black surfaces warm up the soil, or do they cause it to get colder? They tend to draw heat, and so they'll actually help to warm up the soil. So as we get more residue on top of the soil, your soils will start to warm up. And then as you get a thick layer of residue, a lot of farmers think that this is not a good thing, but it actually is. What happens is, think about a compost pile. If I have one to two inches of residue on my soil surface, what happens in the middle of that compost pile? There's biological activity, and that will actually warm up the soil. Most farmers who are doing no-till with cover crops are fighting to keep residue. They have so much microbial activity and so many earthworms, they're actually fighting to keep the residue rather than trying to break it up. If you're having a hard time with residue, if it's causing problems to your tires, we see a lot of that here in Ohio, chances are that you don't have a lot of microbial activity or a lot of earthworms in your soil, and you need to make it get your soil more healthy. Here's where we're measuring soil compaction. We can actually do this in the field, and we're finding out that right next to that root, the soil compaction levels decrease by as much as 30%. Why do our soils compact? Well, look at your crop rotation. Typically, at least here in Ohio, we're drilling most of our soybeans. Drilled soybeans are planted very close together. They have a very poor root system. I would rather see soybeans planted in 15-inch rows or spaced a little wider apart. They have a much healthier root system, and they can help to break up some of this soil compaction. Also, if you look at corn, it has a very thick root, and it tends to be limited by the plow layer. We saw that in Minnesota last year when we visited Minnesota. Their plow layer was down there about 8 inches deep. That's where they plowed every year. Those roots could not get through. Even though they had beautiful soils, they were only reaching about 125 to 140 bushel corn yield. They had some of the prettiest soils I've ever seen, dark, rich, black, but the soil was compacted, so that was limiting their yields. What percentage of the time do we have live roots? Typically, in a corn-soybean rotation, only maybe four months out of the year, and maybe as much as five months, about one-third of the time. If we can add a cover crop to that, we can greatly increase the amount of soil organic matter that we have in the soil. One of the things that people have asked me is, why does no-till really have more live roots than conventional tillage? The answer is not really. It's not until you add the cover crop that we start to gain soil organic matter. So what's missing in no-till is those live roots. Soil compaction is a biological problem. It's related to a lack of living roots in the soil. So I've got about 15 minutes left. Let's start looking at some things that we can do to get rid of this soil compaction. So from looking at subsoiling, here's some research that was done in Ohio. Subsoiling yield gains or losses? If you have conventional tillage, with subsoiling, we found out that the corn yield gained about one to three bushel, or about 3%, about a three percentage increase. On soybean yields, it was just a little bit more. We gained anywhere from two to five bushels, or about a 10% yield increase. What happened when we had long-term no-till? It actually went the other way by the same amount. Our corn yield loss, we lost anywhere from one to three bushel, or about 3%. Soybean yield losses were around 10%. So what does subsoiling do if we're comparing subsoiling versus cover crops? The subsoiler, what does it do? It gives you immediate change in soil structure. It's down as deep as what you're going to subsoil it. If you're going down eight inches deep, however, those changes are not permanent. And it actually leads to greater reliance on tillage in the future because we're losing that soil organic matter. It will increase infiltration in that top 18 inches because you're fluffing up the soil. It leaves the soil susceptible to compaction later. The first trip across that field, you're going to compact that soil. 80% of that soil will recompact almost immediately with the first trip. What can cover crops do? Well, the change is a little bit slower, but it's a little deeper. We can go three feet deep or even deeper with really deep-rooted cover crops. It increases the infiltration, but it may take a little bit of time. Generally, cover crop roots can go through about one foot of compacted soils per year. So if you have a very heavily compacted soil, it may take a little bit of a time. Think about your grain carts and your combines. A typical combine is going to compact that soil 18 inches deep. About 26 tons of compaction for axle load, it'll compact it down to 8 inches deep. One of the things that cover crops do is they protect the soil from erosion. They add nutrients and organic matter. They tie up the nutrients. They fit into a continuous no-till system. They really make the no-till work much better, and they help to protect against soil compaction. If you want to think about this, just imagine if you had two bricks and you put a sponge in between them. What happens is as you add organic matter, if you were to compress those bricks, then bricks would come back apart. The sponge helps to alleviate some of that compaction. It doesn't allow those bricks to get too close together. So if you're imagining these bricks, bricks are made out of clay. They have a negative charge. If we take these two bricks and we get rid of the organic matter, now you've put a positive ion in between there, something like calcium or potash. That's going to set those two bricks up, and it's going to set up like a brick wall. That's what happens. I like to call it cement mix. That's what happens when we till the soil excessively. We need that organic matter in there to cushion the soil. Here's some of the soil resistance, and here's the rankings. We'll start from the bottom. I'm going to go back. Subsoiling, deep rip, full surface tillage. You're adding a lot of oxygen into that soil. It will help you, but the problem is it's a short-term solution. We can moldboard plow or chisel plow. Then when we finally create a fine seed bed, but the problem is, again, the more you disturb the soil, the more organic matter you're losing. You're going to be dependent on that system year after year after year. We can subsoil with wide space shanks, and that will help. We're not doing quite as much disturbance. We can get into strip till where we only till up just a small portion of the field, and then we leave the rest of the field untouched, and that will help. We can do shallow tillage, things like the airway and the phoenix hair. A lot of people call this vertical tillage. The problem with this is now we've changed our compaction layer. We've seen this time and time again. As we do the shallow tillage, your compaction layer, rather than being 8 to 9 inches deep, now may be only 2, 3, 4 inches deep. However far that you go down, the bottom of that tool creates a compacted zone. We can do intermittent no-till, which is tillage every other year. Typically in a corn-soybean rotation, they might till the soybeans and then go to corn because the corn has such a thick root. It really benefits from having well-aerated soils. Or we can start to go to continuous no-till where we get light residue on the soil. Again, now we're building up that organic matter. We'll have less compaction. If we get more residue, that's better with no cover crop. Once we add the cover crop, now we're starting to cushion that soil. Then the best situation is where we have continuous no-till, cover crop, and controlled traffic. Now we're limiting that zone that we're compacting to a very small portion of the field. If we do that year after year, now we can make our soils much healthier and have a lot less compaction. How to establish cover crops? Add diversity to your soils. You can reduce your crop maturities. Basically on corn, we're looking at a shorter maturity. If you can reduce that by five to seven days, that will really help you. We can also grow soybeans. Grow an earlier maturing soybean. One of the key points is we need to give that cover crop time to establish before winter sets in. Most cover crops need anywhere from 60 to 90 days of growth. One of the ways we can do that is we can interseed. We can either fly it on or broadcast it. A lot of our farmers are now investing in these high boy applicators. They have a 90-foot boom on them, and they're using an air seeder with drop-down tubes that they'll go in between the corn, and they can seed cover crops into their corn or even into their soybeans and get them started. Then when they harvest them, a lot of times these cover crops may be two, three inches tall, starting to grow. That gives them a head start going into winter. We can let that cover crop grow longer in the spring and interseed our next crop into it. We like to do this with soybeans. We'll use cereal rye. We'll let that cereal rye grow in the fall, let it grow in the spring. In Ohio, we have a problem with excess moisture, so if we let it grow through respiration, it will allow a lot of that, through transpiration, it will allow a lot of that water to get out of the soil by putting it up into the atmosphere. So we can actually get onto our fields anywhere from seven to ten days earlier. We'll actually let the cereal rye grow up, plant our soybeans into it, let the soybeans come up, then kill the cereal rye. If we kill the cereal rye too early, it'll lay down, and then if we have some wet weather, that soil will stay real sticky, and then it may not dry out until late June or even July. So what we like to do is let it grow up, either drill or plant our soybeans into that cereal rye. It will not hairpin as much, and it won't tend to bind as much, and so it's much easier to do that. We can also use legumes, things like winter peas or crimson clover, and we'll plant those with oilseed radish and do that before corn, and that's been very, very successful. We've seen as much as six to eight bushel yield increases on our soybeans, and with our corn, it varies quite a bit depending on how good your soil structure is, but we're seeing 10, 15 bushels, sometimes even more yield increases by doing this practice. Here's some of the best cover crops to fight soil compaction. Grasses have a very fibrous root system. I'm a real big fan of sorghum sudangrass. You can let your sorghum sudangrass grow a little bit. In Ohio, we tend to plant it after wheat. We have winter wheat, so our wheat will come off in July. We plant the sorghum sudangrass. If you can let that sorghum sudangrass get about three feet tall and either harvest it, in some cases guys don't have livestock, so they'll just mow it off. When you mow sorghum sudangrass, you get anywhere from five to nine times more roots being grown, and so it really tillers out, and it's all about roots in the soil. That really helps to keep your soil. It really gives good soil structure to your soil. Annual ryegrass is another really good one. It can be a little harder to manage. Cereal rye and oats can also be used. Very fine roots. They can find those planes of weaknesses. They can really help you with soil compaction. They also go fairly deep in the soil. Annual ryegrass will go five to six feet deep, unless there's water or limiting layer. Cereal rye tends to go about 30 to 36 inches in similar numbers for oats. We can also use sabrassicas, things like the oilseed radish or the turnips. Oilseed radish, especially some of the daikon varieties, such as tillage radish or the groundhouse radish, they get a fairly good size root system. They're white. They're very sweet. The earthworms absolutely love them. And they do a very good job in loosening up soil. Matter of fact, if you're going to plant oilseed radish, never plant them by themselves on a hill with greater than a 3% slope. We've actually seen some of the soil on these slopes start to move if you get a heavy rainfall. We like to plant them with another grass or plant them with another legume to get more roots and to have more biomass there. For legumes, you want a large root network. Hairy vetch, cow bees, red clover, and winter peas are some of the ones that we're using. That gives you the relationship. If you've got a problem with surface compaction, buckwheat is excellent and also phacelia. That's a new one that came out of France. They work quite well. Buckwheat is very beneficial for insects and it also helps if you have low phosphorus. It has a lot of organic acids in it so it will release phosphorus into the soil. So if we're looking at, and I'm getting low on time, so I'm going to go through this fairly quickly. I've got about six more slides. If you look at the new concept that we're looking at, we're calling it eco-farming or ecological farming. We're trying to keep the soil covered with live plants year-round. Again, if you only have plants out there four months out of the year, you only have about a third as much fuel and energy going into that soil. The plants give energy to the microbes and the microbes keep those nutrients recycling. It also improves your soil. If we can keep those year-round, we've got 100% of the fuel and energy going into that soil. Here's what happens under conventional tillage. You have a smaller microbial population. We've got this brown combine, rusty combine. You'll notice we have a lot of carbon dioxide going up into the atmosphere. Here where we have the eco-farming, we're not disturbing the soil. We have a much larger microbial population and they're going to keep more nitrogen and phosphorus recycling in the soil. And here's the relationship. Every 1% organic matter can give you as much as $850 of nutrients that's going to tie up per year. 1,000 pounds of nitrogen and roughly 100 pounds of phosphorus, potash, and sulfur. That adds up to about $850 for every 1% soil organic matter. How do we lose these? Well, when we do tillage, you'll see these whirlwinds there. That's the carbon dioxide going off. And you'll notice that we can't tie up as much of the nitrogen and the phosphorus because we have less organic matter in the soil. Anywhere from 50% to 75% of the phosphorus is tied up organically. And right around 90% of the nitrogen is tied up in an organic form. Here where we're doing the eco-farming, we're carrying those nutrients forward. These plants that are alive in the winter, even though the soil may be cold, it's much warmer down below. It'd be around 50 degrees there. They can, below the frost line, they can actually take up nutrients all winter long. And they're turning that into soil organic matter, something that we'll turn into. Here's what happens when we do too much tillage. Tillage to the soil microbes is like the worst hurricane, the worst earthquake, worst forest fire, and the worst tornado all wrapped up into one event. It really disturbs them. They don't like to have this disturbance. You'll have a much healthier microbial population if you stop doing the tillage. And where do we lose these nutrients? Most of them are lost in the winter. They're lost to the air and to the water because we don't have plant roots there to absorb them. So a lot of times in late winter, early spring with the snow melt, a lot of these nutrients are lost. Here where we have the eco-farming, we're keeping those nutrients tied up and we're carrying them forward to the next crop. Finally, in summary, I think I might have a minute or two for questions. Soil compaction is related to the biology of the soil and how the soil was managed. Organic matter and microbes influence soil compaction. If you have cold no-till soils, it's probably a result of soil compaction and poor soil structure. If you can add cover crops and no-till to that system, you'll actually improve your soils. And they should be warm and moist. That's an ideal place to plant corn and soybeans. Active living roots and the microbes are acting and working together to improve your soil structure. That equals this ecological funding that we're really promoting no-till plus cover crops. So I think I have maybe a minute to go. We may get cut off. Any questions? I did that pretty quick. That's about as fast as I've done that. So if we get cut off, that's fine. All right. Well, sorry for some of the technical problems we had and delays, but I hope you guys enjoy your conference. Can somebody tell me about how many people we have there? 230. Well, great. I wish I could be with you, but okay. I'll see if I can answer it. Hello? How do we get cover crops to grow all year? Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Okay. One of the benefits as you go a little further north is especially cereal rye, it originated in the mountains of China. Those roots are active all year round. Even though they may not be growing, snow actually protects a lot of our cover crops. You may have a much more beneficial growth to some of these cover crops. What's really detrimental to cover crops is the wind. And so if you can protect that crown of these cover crops and keep some residue over there, even though it looks like they're not doing, you may not see a whole lot of top growth, they can do a lot of benefit from just the roots growing down through the soil. Cereal rye is a really good one after corn, probably in South Dakota. I mean, it grows up into Canada. So that's probably one of your best ones. Other questions? Oh, well, good. Sure. We can do that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. In a dry spring. Yes, there can be. And what you want to do is if you have a dry spring and you see that you're going to go into a drought, you want to conserve moisture. What you want to do is you want to build your organic matter, but you don't want to hurt that next crop. So, and it's hard to predict this. But if you see that the soil is excessively dry and you're getting a lot of transpiration going on, you can kill that cover crop early. You guys don't have as much problem. Here in Ohio, we have seven out of ten years it's wet. And so we're trying to dry out our soils. You probably need to manage your soils a little differently. You might want to kill that cover crop early in order to conserve moisture and then plant into it when the conditions are right. But it should make the soil much more mellow. That's at least what we've seen here in Ohio, especially where we're using these oilseed radish. We used to worry about we'd have too big of a hole there. But you'll also find, and I didn't tell you this, cover crops will give you more moisture because you're going to trap more snow. We've seen this time and time again. If you put up, it's almost like a snow fence. It traps the snow on the soil so that it's not blowing across your field. And you'll actually gain some moisture by having a cover crop that's maybe a couple inches tall. It'll trap that snow there and you'll gain basically what you're losing. All the recent information that's come out says that cover crops are really adding water to the soil. And even though we're losing some from transpiration, if we see that that's a problem, just kill them early. Thank you. Does that make sense? It's probably a thing. Oh. Well, I'll tell you a quick one until we get cut off here, a story from Nebraska. We had some guys, this idea of fallow soils, that's the stupidest idea we ever come up. That's my personal opinion. I'm just going to tell you that. In Nebraska, some guys started doing no-till, long-term no-till with cover crops. They found out that they were using two feet of irrigation per year. They reduced it down to six inches per year by going to no-till and cover crops. The reason being is they were trapping more snow and they were adding organic matter to their soil so now they could store more water. Remember that chart that I gave you was the inches of water per foot of soil. So if you can get these cover crops to go very deep into the soil and add a couple percentage points of organic matter to each foot of soil, you can greatly increase your water storage capacity. And then if you have that residue on the surface, you're not going to have as much heat. You're not going to have as much evaporation going on. You're going to store a lot more water in your soil. Rain makes grain, but also going along with that, more water-holding capacity in your soil is going to equal higher yields. Rain makes grain, so I'm going to keep–∞—Å—å. I've got another meeting here in Ohio yet tonight that I have to do, so thank you for inviting me. It's been a pleasure. Thank you.
