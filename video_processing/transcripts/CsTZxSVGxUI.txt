ご視聴ありがとうございました Hi, I'm Mark Hall with Alabama Cooperative Extension System and with me today is Chet Norris, Director of the Tennessee Valley Research and Extension Center here in Limestone County, Alabama. Chet, we have worked with harvesting water for irrigation for several years on the station. What's the concept of harvesting water for irrigation? Here in Tennessee Valley, Mark, as you know, most of the irrigation systems pull from strains. It's extremely difficult to obtain well water, although there are some wells, but the majority of them pull from strains. So there's a tremendous demand on these small strains during drought times when we really need the irrigation water. So the idea came about here at the center 18 years ago for us to have water harvesting and storage projects. So what we do, we have Limestone Creek, a leg of Limestone Creek, that runs through the center. So during high water times, which is typically November through March, the stream is a full pool. There's a lot of water that's running down to the Tennessee River. At that time, we'll pump water from Limestone Creek into a reservoir that we have that contains 140 acre feet. And we'll fill that reservoir and strictly use that stored water for our irrigation needs during the growing season. So it gives you water in wet times to use in dry times. What type of farming operation might this fit with, Chet? It fits well with us. Of course, we are small acres compared to large growers. I see some instances where it makes some growers with some specialty crops, which would be smaller acres perhaps, could utilize this type of system. And I also understand there's some towns, municipalities that have considered using this type of stored water system for backup water supplies perhaps. Those type things. Thank you, Chet. Appreciate your information on harvesting water. For all of our irrigation videos and other ag videos, visit our website on YouTube. Here's the address for that website. Thank you for watching our video today. If we can help you, please let us know. If we could have adventure with our piş questions on our sätt. Here you are. ahead. Here's the compare to ourestion and downcast. Here we cancuss our sentimental system, our Continues tactic in summary and with all forms of spaghetti.
