Science & Technology
 The biggest change we're seeing today is how often you have to rip, what crops you've ripped before, where it is in your rotation and how often you have to go back. We're seeing a lot of farmers are going back and going deeper, another hundred mil deeper when they go back because they're getting another free kick. Their yields are jumping again. Do it and do it properly.
