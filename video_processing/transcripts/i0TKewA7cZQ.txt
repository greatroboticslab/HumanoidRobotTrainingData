 Folks, how we doing? Welcome to Good Works Tractors. It's a chilly day, to say the least, outside. So I thought we'd do something inside. I just got a new air compressor, and I've got a couple other of the California... Yeah. California Air Tools brand air compressors as well. And what I like about them most, you can't get them locally, at least that I've been able to find, but they're very quiet. If you're inside, I just hate all that noise. You can hear the heater going right now in the background probably, and you just... Well, an air compressor is way worse. So if this all goes well, and I bought all the right stuff for it here on Amazon, then I'll turn it on at the end of this and show you how quiet it is. It's pretty incredible. This is the biggest one that I bought, but it still... Well, it says on there somewhere, yeah, oil-free and ultra-quiet. So we're going to see what it's all about. Just plugs into a regular 110 outlet. Let's get to it here. Well, actually, a couple of things, too, I wanted to point out. Well, I'm still getting moved in here, so everything's a mess. I don't have all my tools together. But I saw this earlier. I want to show you. I did get... I got a Yankem rope, like you guys talked about, back when we got the skid steer stuck. So got this right here. Haven't had to use it yet, but I'm sure I will sometime soon. But got this big old... It was a fat rope. I think I got one that was rated for a lot of weight. Did come with a couple of shackles here, too. So, anyway, that was your guys' suggestion. And I've got one other thing to show you that I need a suggestion on because this is super annoying. Here, watch this. Let me get this out of the way. I've got this little piece of paper holding that drawer in. But watch. If you just open it and want to close it again, it just starts to open back up. That's real annoying. None of the other drawers do that. Stay in place. You know, this one here stays. All the other ones stay. But not that top one. That's real annoying. How do I fix that? We'll put that back in there for now. Yeah, here we go. All right, folks. Thought I'd tell you a little bit about this thing while we're putting it together. Again, it's my third one. I've got two of the one-horsepower units. Well, I bought both of them a long time ago. One for my house and one for my shop. And still using the one at the shop. I got the other one in the barn. I'll probably end up bringing the smaller one up here to the house and leave this new, bigger one out there at the barn. It'll be more useful out there. This is a 10-gallon tank on here. 70 decibels. 2-horsepower motor. 125 psi max. 5.3 CFM at 90 psi. That must be a common readout. I don't know. So this thing is, well, it's California Air Tools, but I don't want you to be misled there. On the box, it says made in Mexico. The motor itself says made in China. 110 volt, 15 amps. So you can see we're going to have it hooked up just to a regular outlet in our garage. Oh, we're going to do a sound test, too, at the end and show you just how loud this thing is or how quiet it is, maybe, depending on what way you want to go with it. But the manufacturer, the video, too, it looks like maybe they found the noisiest air compressor to compare it against. But it does give you a pretty good sound comparison between something that is pretty darn quiet versus something that is, like, chattering and loud and really annoying. A few interesting points that the manufacturer states, they've got an easy start valve, allowing it for easier startups using less starting amps. Oil-free pump allows it for use in a variety of temperatures, you know, in quotes, cold starts and uneven terrain, no oil in the pump. The easy start valve releases a small amount of air from the pump at startup to produce a no-load condition, allowing the motor to spin freely. And again, it is a pretty large, for its size at least, 10-gallon steel air tank. I read a review on this one just because I wanted to make sure it was similar to the other ones I have, and they didn't put this, I think it was just this little hose in here that made a big difference on the sound level. Maybe they forgot to put the entire filter on. I can't remember what it was. But regardless, don't forget to do it. There we go. I think that's how that goes. Is there a, there was an unthreaded space there? Must have been. All right. Five-eighths. Maybe 13, 16. Maybe it's metric. Real sloppy. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. 18. 17. Wow! 19. 18. 19. that other one seems to go freely I don't know what I'm doing here still skidding a bit better but that maybe it won't it's literally gonna it's gonna come it's gonna take itself right off all right I thought we did something wrong on these casters you can see skid marks here no not that kind of skid marks but it is not freely moving I thought we were doing something wrong and we're not it says tighten firmly come on I'm not over tightening that seemed to make the condition worse but if you don't tighten enough they just the nut starts to spin right off pretty quick anyway I don't know maybe we've got to add some grease on there it didn't call for it but look that is that's not freely spinning I'm pretty sure it's the same casters on all my other ones too I don't feel like that's gonna loosen up with time I could be wrong that one what the heck that one spins real nice we got one out of two of them or can we'll just kind of lean it to the side a little bit we need to move it around folks we are proud to be sponsored by Rimguard Solutions a liquid ballast weight it goes right inside your tires completely hidden we're big on safety on this channel these tractors are just too light and tippy right out of the factory not only is it gonna help with safety keeping those rear tires planted on the ground it helps with loader efficiency and traction too the benefits of Rimguard include being the heaviest all natural liquid ballast weight on the market it's not going to corrode your rims like the old calcium chloride it's not going to freeze and it's available at over a thousand dealers nationwide find the dealer near you at Rimguard solutions dot com well that just actually fits right down in there with ...... eyes when honors this is why we like the temperature so things can only fÃ¼r dot including the 212 is the best Why doesn't that want to go on there? Must be why they gave you two. That's a little bit better. I don't think any of these are big enough though. Okay, this thing, it is off right now. Oh, and it came in, listen to this. A little bit of air in there. Probably because that's lighter for shipping that way. There you go. Plug this in. Oh, a little bit closer. Got that. Get ready. You ready, Chris? Okay. Not that high-pitched. Still have the conversation in here instead of the . What's going on? That's pretty nice. This is louder though than my smaller one. I think one horsepower. This is a two horsepower unit. A little bit bigger. I think it's like 10 decibels louder, but that's pretty quiet. I'm assuming you can still hear me talking right now. What happens if I take this out? Oh, yeah. That is actually louder. Wow. Off. Full. Oh, it disconnects. Oh, then you pop it out to. Pressure regulator. Safety. See, the pressure right now is, oh, 40, 50, 60, 65-ish. No, sorry. Oh, that's a 60 there. 30 to 60. So what it divided by, it's an interesting dash sequence. So it goes up six pounds per, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60. Okay. That's logical. Anywho, that's what that's at. Pressure regulator. So this is the regulated air pressure. This is a tank. What you're putting out right here, which we're at about 45 or a little bit over 40. So you can turn that down. And then once you're using it, or I guess if you had enough pressure to go up above here, you know, this is way up here or maybe way up here, you can still regulate it so it wasn't too much coming out. Like if you're using air tools, that kind of thing. On off. So you're going to see this is a pretty easy, simple thing to put together. We did have some issues with the caster wheel down there at the bottom on one side. I'm going to reach out to them, see if we can get a different one. The other one works just like it should. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. I probably am. But we did have to get, I bought a whole new hose kit and fittings and just some basic accessories for now until I get, the barn's getting finished. So I'm going to get that all set up soon. And I think we'll probably get a few air tools to keep out there as well. But smaller units I've had for, I think three years, maybe a little bit longer. They've been serving me well and in fact, not too long ago, the guys at the shop just kind of pointed out just how quiet that compressor is out there. So anyway, we'll see. As long as they fix that wheel down there, I'm probably going to be another satisfied customer. I keep coming back to them. I bought this one on Amazon. I'll put a link down there. You don't have to get the two horsepower. They make a lot smaller ones too. But for me, the big selling point with these guys is quiet. So I hate the loud, chattery sound and this seems to fit the bill. So that'll wrap it up for us today. If there's anything else I should know about this, I'd love to learn something new. So leave a comment down below. And if you've got a better solution besides our hunk of paper here to keep that drawer closed, I would love to know about it.
