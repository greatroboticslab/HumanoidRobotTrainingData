 Music So the key messages for northern growers arising from the farming systems project are that a range of different systems have been profitable over the last five years. That includes systems that involve legumes. They have been amongst the most profitable, the least risky, a highest return on investment and can help growers stay on top of weed and disease issues if they have them. One of the big benefits of the legume systems with high nitrogen fertiliser prices over the last couple of years have really meant that the legume systems have an advantage of lower input costs for nitrogen. So despite some difficulties with legumes in the system they have been holding their own when you look at the sequence over a number of years. My key messages to growers around nitrogen in this coming season is that it is really critical to soil test because we've had three high yielding seasons and we've also had a very wet spring and wet summer which can lead to a lot of nitrogen losses through denitrification and leaching and runoff. So before growers can manage nitrogen effectively in the coming season they really need to know what they've got left in their soil from last year and the best way of doing that is by soil testing. Growers need to soil test because the variation in mineral nitrogen that we're likely to see after this season will be more extreme than perhaps we've ever seen in the last 20 years. The big challenge that we've got to have this year is that last year was such a good year year and good years generally mean that we end up with lots of weed seed set so farmers have got big weed seed banks to deal with this year so they need to make sure that they get their strategies right for that and when we're thinking about grass weeds one of the things about grass weeds is that most weeds are active grass weeds we've got quite a lot of resistance to post-emergent herbicides so pre-emergent herbicides are the main strategy we're going to use for herbicides so getting our pre-emergent herbicide strategy right is crucial. Following on from last year and the very high disease load that growers experienced in 2022 leading into 2023 some of the really important things for growers to be aware of is destroying what we call the green bridge these are self-sown cereals that are established during the summer months really really important to destroy them at least four weeks before the next cropping cycle goes in and the reason for that is that that green bridge will harbour the pathogens from the previous season and allow them to survive into the current season. One of the big key messages I think for growers leading into 2023 cropping season is really to remain disciplined with sowing dates this year and try not to let last year influence their decisions too much I know last year was quite a needy year where a lot of disease pressure and a lot of difficulties with logistics and getting back on country but I guess the sort of key highlight was that you know timing of management and operations was still really critical so really sticking to those sowing dates where we can achieve flowering within an optimal window is really key. I need something to do here.
