 Stick with me and I'm going to show you my guide to growing baby corn. Although it's kind of late in the season now, because baby corn grows so fast, somewhere between 30 to 45 days, you can still catch one more crop right now if you put it in. Now when I mean baby corn, I'm talking about they actually sell seeds that aren't regular corn. They're called baby corn. I guess they're developed that way to grow up really quick and soft. So these are like the little ones you see in Asian dishes and stir fries and stuff, the tiny little corns. So here's my experience with my, I would say experiment, my baby corn experiment because I had never grown them before. So today I'm going to harvest baby corn. Now I grew this as just a small little experimental patch because I had never grown baby corn. And if you guys don't know what I'm talking about, baby corn is those little corns you get like in Asian stir fries and stuff. uh, well, it's supposed to be very rapid growing. growing and you can even grow it in a pot but since I'm up in New Hampshire the weather was pretty cold and when I put this in the ground it was at the end of March I believe and it took a while to get going but once the heat hit it grew really fast and rapidly normally this only takes about 45 days to get these little corns now when they start coming up here these corns you're supposed to pick them within three to five days because it's rained so much I've been lazy about getting out here and it's more like seven days they might be too big at this point sorry I had a spider on me I had to come back so yeah it might be a little too late for some of these I'm gonna have to cut them up and stir fry them I don't know if I could eat them raw in a salad they're too big now so I'm gonna show you what these things look like so we're just gonna break one off otherwise just have to cut it off oh I'm sorry plant here we go so I got one off and we'll open it up and see what's inside here so this one is already too big pretty much I can't cut it up and make it into regular corn but I think I left this too long it's not supposed to be this big they're pretty much like almost real corns at this point still very soft I mean I'm sure if I cut it up and stir fry it I'll be alright let's even find a smaller one so this is more the size you're looking for even smaller than this if you can find it but it's it's only a few inches um these if you catch them small if you can actually eat them raw cut them up and put them in a salad but most likely I'm gonna have to cook all these guys so baby corn is pretty easy to grow it just takes a while until the heat comes out when the heat comes out then they take off I tried growing this corn too early I think and it just took forever and if you've never grown corn you have to let these things flower first these are the flowers and you always want to plant them in a grid don't put them in rows and they cross pollinate and then the corns just shoot up in a few days after the flowers open at least baby corn all right so I hope you learned something so I hope you learned and got a kernel of knowledge about baby corn seek a kernel and and I hope that joke was not too corny see what I did there corny okay I'm getting bad luck so I'm gonna go so this is one of the baby corns I just picked and even at this size you can still eat it raw and tastes sort of like cross between a corn and a carrot very crunchy though but you can eat them raw so it's gonna eat them raw not bad I didn't think you could eat them this large but they're they're good one last thing I want to say even at this size you can still eat them raw I took a bite here so you can see it but uh I'm I had no idea you could eat them this large they're still good so that was my experiment maybe next year I'll grow a much bigger patch now that I know it's pretty easy it was tasty I liked a little little corn things even though they got a little too big but they're not bad um the other thing is please remember to check out my Amazon page it's listed below in the links if you're gonna shop on Amazon I'd really appreciate if you go through my link and and have have a look anyway so thank you so much for that and the other thing I want to remind you of is that to go to my website below loopotv.com there you can find exclusive videos you can't find anywhere else so I really really appreciate it thanks so much for checking out my channel and keep watching my other farming stories you'll see them up here here and there as always be nice to that cat
