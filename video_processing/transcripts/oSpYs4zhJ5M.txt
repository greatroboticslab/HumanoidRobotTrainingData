 So as a former FSA employee, I was responsible for managing the county office. I was a county executive director and we administered government programs and those programs range from price support, conservation, disaster programs and our goal was to reach the farmers who are in need of services that we provided and it was a great experience and a great step in my career and I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed the hands-on and the one-on-one interaction with the farmers. Well when I first walked into FSA office I didn't quite understand. They told me I needed to have a farm number and Jeannie Turnage who is now retired was my FSA agent and she sat down and you know talked to me. I didn't quite understand everything that she said and so being a former federal employee I looked up FSA and did my own research to get a better understanding of what the office was about and found out that they primarily did the insurance, they provided loans and they were the originator of the FSA number that I needed to have in order to receive the rest of the benefits that USDA could provide. I think you kind of have to get your foot in the door. FSA to me when I first started working with them I guess because I was so new they really didn't pay me a lot of attention to be honest. When I produced that first hemp crop it really put me in with the FSA office like okay he's a real farmer and I was able to get an equipment loan and just the doors just flew open after 2019 and just like I was able to get the hoop house the next year and it's just opened up so many doors. My advice to farmers who want to become involved with FSA is at any step in your operation even when you just purchase a farm or lease a farm or rent a farm I would encourage you to go ahead and get that farm number established or if you're leasing or in the farm go ahead and get added on that farm as other tenant or operator. You can do that initially at the very beginning of your farming process and as you get that farm number that's really the key stepping stone or the initial phase of getting you involved and in a system to be eligible for programs and after you get acquainted with what programs are available you can determine which programs would be a good fit for your operation. So basically just assess what's available and look at what applies to your farm and then go in and apply and put your application in and so these resources can help you directly on the farm. The NRCS has really benefited me a lot soil and water they help me with the hoop house and they also help me with the well which I call share things but you just put up the money and once you're done you get that money back. Those would be the two main things and also Jason Silvers with the farm he's a farm loan officer that I have dealt with for the equipment loan he really helped me a lot. Taking advantage of the free insurance that's available to socially disadvantaged farmers and that's in place for the first 10 years as a new and beginning farmer that I would highly recommend farmers take advantage of since it's free why not and as you know all the risk involved with farming and climate change you don't know from you know day to day what the weather's going to bring so you know having that free insurance will help you it's not going to pay for everything but some reimbursement is better than none at all in the event of a severe drought a snowstorm that you know destroys everything please take advantage of the FSA insurance that's available. Sometimes when farmers and producers go online to the website with FSA or NRCS or any government agency who may offer programs it may become overwhelming because it's a wealth of information which is a good thing it's a lot to offer and it's a lot to read and it's a lot to learn but my first piece of advice for farmers who want to get acquainted with these programs is go online and look up the fact sheets the fact sheets are abbreviated versions of the program guidelines that's laid out in a format that's easy to understand and normally it's no more than one two or maybe three pages at the most so I'll encourage you to get acquainted with the fact sheets and that fact sheet is going to give you all the information that you need to have a good background knowledge on the program so when you enter the office you kind of have a direction on which way you want to go in which programs that may benefit you on your farm. I try to engage with them on a periodic basis you know at least two or three times a year you know I go in so they know my face today I'm gonna stop by because it's time for the county elections and I think as especially a minority farmer we need to be represented on represented on have representation excuse me on the county committee so I'm gonna put my name in the hat and I encourage other farmers to do the same because these are the people that make decisions on how USDA dollars are spent in your farming community and most farmers that have been there understand that you know when they apply for that high tunnel you know if you've ever heard the word no you didn't receive it if you're on that committee you know why and you have a say-so on who gets those resources so I encourage farmers to get involved and understand the inner working of how USDA dollars flow to their county by being on that county committee and if you're not on the county committee those meetings are open public meetings attend those meetings you know so that you can see and they know that you know you're looking so that you know there's equity in what's going on at the county level. You know just start small don't think that you're gonna have tomorrow today you know and that's what I've learned is that you know just be slow and steady don't try to run too fast because it's gonna cause hiccups and you want that paper trail get a good paper trail behind you and what you're saying you're doing and really do what you say you're doing you know and stick to the application of that and just stick with it you know and then eventually you'll be able to get some farm loans and different things especially if you start just pulling in a little bit of revenue and you have some taxes to follow that you know. Going into the FSA office to build a great relationship with that team is first the first thing you can do is call ahead and schedule an appointment. FSA and other government agencies are normally extremely busy especially this time of the year with acreage reporting actually today is the acreage reporting deadline July 15th so they are extremely extremely busy and sometimes if you show up you know there may be a lot going on but take time to schedule an appointment and take time to look at those program fact sheets and have some knowledge of the programs that you may be interested in and also I'll back up a little bit if you're going in to establish that farm number go ahead and already have a copy of your deed or your lease agreements have have all the paperwork kind of in hand so when you go in you'll have everything you need to complete that first step or or any step in the process of getting you enrolled in these programs. do make the tape the If the attemptedуль music rad тур state during thatUMtime, then the helm WILL bridge over again.
