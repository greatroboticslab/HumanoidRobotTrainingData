 Catch a whiff of that? It's the alluring scent of chives, your next garden superstar. Imagine a herb related to onions, garlic and leeks, but with a more subtle refined flavour. Picture long thin leaves that mirror the elegance of grass and small hollow tubes filled with aroma and taste. Now here's the kicker. Chives are not just a culinary delight, they're a goldmine. With a maturation period of just 45 days, they're one of the most profitable short season crops. And the harvest? Every 25 days for 3 years straight. That's right, a gift that keeps on giving. So why not turn your green thumb into a green bank account? With chives, you're not just gardening, you're investing. And remember, the best time to plant a seed was 20 years ago. The second best time? Now. Subscribe for more horticultural hacks.
