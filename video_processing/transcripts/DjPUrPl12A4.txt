Education
 Welcome to the UVM Extension New Farmer Project webinar, Farm Scale Permaculture, Techniques, Practices, and Philosophies for Permanent Agriculture Systems. I'm Jessi Schmidt, and I work for the UVM Extension New Farmer Project. I'll be moderating this session. Our presenter today is Keith Morris. Since 2000, he has worked professionally as a designer, builder, and grower of ecologically regenerative, socially just, and culturally appropriate whole systems in cities and countrysides around the world. He teaches at the University of Vermont, the Yes Tomorrow Design Build School, Sterling College, Paul Smith's College, Burlington Permaculture, and has worked for USAID Farmer to Farmer in Nigeria and Ghana. Welcome, Keith. Thanks, Jessi. It's a pleasure to be here. Just as far as sound goes, is that sounding okay to folks? If you could maybe come up or let me know that that sounds good. I think it sounds pretty good. If you might be able to pull your mic a little bit away, it's just a little muffled. Yeah. Okay. I can pull it away. Great. Yeah. It's a pleasure to be here, and I'm really excited to be a part of the webinar series. It's such a great collection of resources already there in terms of webinars. Yeah. So this was some stuff that we already did here as far as the map, so I think I'm just going to skip through that. And as Jesse said, you know, I work as a designer. Really, my work as a designer began working for a variety of farms. I started my own farm when I was 23 in an interesting rent-to-own process. It's a Willow Crossing farm in Johnson, Vermont, where we grow fruit trees, nut trees, berry bushes, vines, medicinal herbs, and we're increasingly doing added value in terms of farm. Oh, I'm hearing that I'm not. I can turn my mic up. How's that, Ida? Does that sound a little better? Just let me know if there's sound issues again. So increasingly, we're doing kind of added value production in terms of farm dinners and educational events. My other business is Prospect Rock Permaculture, which is really more of a design and education aspect, where I work with farmers and other institutions and community groups to help figure out how to make landscapes more productive and connected. Just a brief little history with that. If anyone's familiar with these two areas geographically, Willow Crossing is an area that is overlooked by Prospect Rock. And long before there was such great aerial photography that we have today, I would go up to Prospect Rock, a bluff on the Long Trail and kind of look down over my farm in order to help me figure things out and do some design work. So we're going to be talking about permaculture design as applied to farms. But this isn't intended as a basic introduction to permaculture. So it's a very, very big field. There's a lot of things to explore. But for those of you that aren't familiar, the word comes not only from permanent agriculture, but also permanent agriculture. And kind of looking at how ecology can better inform the ways that we meet our needs. So everything from food really as a centerpiece, you know, agriculture has always been a centerpiece of permaculture. But also shelter, also energy, also waste management, how these things can be better connected and modeled after what we see working in natural systems. So I have two definitions here of permaculture. There are hundreds, but meeting human needs while increasing ecological health and the postmodern synthesis of all wise human behavior. A big part of permaculture, of course, is studying traditional techniques and recombining them in novel ways in response to some of the things that we're facing in the 20th century. So mostly permaculture is a vision and a design system. And it's a network of people. That's really where it's such an exciting thing to be a part of. There's folks all over the world using this design technique in order to actualize this vision of a permanent culture. So the basis is in ethics, which is something that's kind of unique in land management systems. And in slogan form, these are earth care, people care, and fair share, which are kind of self-evident. But obviously we want to look, take responsibility for the resources that we depend on, natural systems that we depend on. But we're also caring for people. And it's really about how, as I've said, we're meeting human needs while improving ecological health and recognizing that that isn't necessarily a contradiction of terms. Although there's certainly plenty of evidence to lead us to believe that may be the case. When we look at long-term human needs, obviously we need to have good soil in which we grow our food, we need to have clean air, we need to have clean water. And then lastly and not least importantly, fair share meaning limits to consumption, limits to population, but most importantly redistribution of our resources towards better care of the earth and better care of people. So that's the permaculture ethics in a nutshell. If you aren't familiar with permaculture, even if you are, I just point out here at the bottom, the permacultureprinciples.com website, which is really a great resource for the permaculture. The design principles are varied and they're the things that you can use to include the permaculture ethics and principles. The design principles are varied and they're the things that you can use to include permaculture ethics and principles. The design principles are varied and they're the things that we're learning from our study of traditional culture and our study of ecology and what's working in any context. And while we'll look at some techniques that may be place specific or specific to a culture or ecological context, really at its core these ethics and principles work. wherever we find ourselves in the world. So I won't be getting too into depth with these principles, but we'll address them a little bit. I think seeing my pointer as I move it around the screen. Yeah, so we'll be looking at how we can integrate pieces of our systems to be more mutually beneficial. Just to kind of give a sense of the spectrum of permaculture design, I'll share with you the permaculture flower and we see there's these kind of seven points of action. So permaculture really encompasses how we build, the tools and technologies we use, the education and our cultural aspects, health and well-being, finances and economy, land tenure and community government, and land and nature stewardship. So it's a very big system and today we're really going to be looking at just some of these, maybe specifically how we read landscapes and how agriculture fits in in terms of our land and nature stewardship. But all of these different pieces are kind of part of our agriculture tool kit. Alright. So at any time, if there's questions, feel free to type them into the box there. I'm going to share a little bit more about my own farm. Just briefly, we're actually going to do some time travel. This is an aerial photograph that was taken in 1942 of the area where I farm. And in 1942 they started taking aerial photographs as a part of defense strategies for World War II. They've turned out to be some really great resources for our understanding of land management. And I'm not going to get into too much detail, but I just kind of point out the curve of the river here as it was in 1942. And also introduce these photographs not only to share my own farm, but to let you know that if you're farming, it's probably going to be well worth your while to dig into the archives of the map rooms of the USDA or your local state land-grant university or wherever these files may be archived because they will share incredible insight to the past of our landscapes. So as we travel through time here, we're going to see a couple of things. One is that even in just a few decades, we see tremendous changes happening in our landscapes. And I'm sure we're all well aware of that, but to really be able to quantify that in a place-specific way can be an incredibly helpful tool in helping contextualize our own decision-making process and our designs. So in terms of this particular site, we see that obviously there's some pretty severe erosion happening along the riverbank. Also here as we move into 1995, we see the original farm and homestead and barn raised and put into the ground where there's the beginning of a church constructed. And we can see as I've started to set up my farm, some of the changes happening in terms of ecological succession, both allowing some areas of old pasture to start to regrow and here we are with one of the more recent photograph series where you can kind of get a sense of what's happening on my farm, which I'll talk a little bit more about. I share that because it's really critical that we make an effort to comprehend our place in our landscapes with long-term perspective and do that in order to have long-term cooperation with the ecosystems that we're cooperating, that we're, you know, depending on and interacting with and most importantly use that long-term understanding as a point of foresight so we can do some long-term planning. So that's where we're going to be heading here now is getting into some of the details of how we'll do the actual work of design. So the permaculture design process, it can be done in an endless variety of ways but in its simplest, you know, we want to be very clear about what it is that we're trying to achieve in terms of goals articulation. Let's see. Okay. And we'll be working on maps in terms of having an actual physical record that we can refer to as we make observations about our landscapes. The focus of today's talk is really going to be how we do site analysis and from that analysis we're going to come up with design concepts which are really very kind of loose ideas and I know that's hard for many of us, especially if we're market growers. And I actually, I'll take a minute just to ask who is farming and if folks wouldn't mind just typing in to the chat box there, if you're farming, if you're coming here with a specific site in mind in terms of where you want to apply this design process, I'd be curious to see that. Okay, great. Yeah. So we as growers are often really good at thinking about specific crops or varieties and we may have some great skills in terms of rotations and soil prep. And these are all critical, you know, foundational, but, um, Horticulture is kind of going to flip this around a little bit and that we're not going to be starting necessarily from an individual crop or technique, but really contextualizing that in the whole of our farm. And this is why having a design concept comes before detailed design in our, um, in our design process here in that it's really easy to determine exactly what variety you want to grow and how far apart it should be planted. But what we're trying to focus on is having more importantly that these pieces are taking place within the whole, um, uh, and in better relationship to all the other pieces of our farm. So, for instance, if we realize that we need a hedgerow or a windbreak on a farm, maybe before we even get into what species we might be using in a hedgerow or a windbreak is exactly how it's placed and how it relates to some of our vegetable production or grazing paddocks or vineyards or whatever other aspects we may have. So, um, this is great. Thanks everyone for chiming in with your, um, this is great. So, hi Kevin. Okay. So, and then last of all, of course, you know, it's not just, um, you know, the designing, but, uh, one of the most important pieces is actually doing this, right? Putting it in the ground and then of course continuing to accept feedback and recognizing that these systems are much more akin to sailing ships and that we're constantly adjusting the sails in our rigging. We're always accepting feedback and responding to change. We're responding to market. We're responding to what's working. We're responding to what we're enjoying. Um, and it's a very dynamic process. And unfortunately, we're never done. Um, okay. So, um, goals articulation in and of itself is something that honestly we could do a full hours webinar on because it is so critical. And I won't, um, spend a whole hour talking about goals articulation, but, um, I will encourage any of you who are planning to bring a design process to your farm to do some very, very thorough goals articulating, um, which is a little bit different than goal setting, right? It's about figuring out really what it is that you're, um, that's really making your heart resonate, right? It's not about kind of setting external objectives. And, um, on my website, prospectrock.org, there is some educational resources and in there is a document that gives you some detailed exercises to help you, um, articulate goals. And honestly, even if you aren't yet farming or even don't have a piece of land where you're farming, you may be even in the best position to do some goals articulation. And as I work with clients, you know, honestly, a lot of times the place I prefer to work, the place at least I have the highest leverage is, is if folks have, um, some ideas but they don't necessarily have a space yet. Meaning to say, you know, that you can do a lot with any given piece of land but if you know that you want to do vegetable production or if you know you want to do an apple orchard or if you know you want to be grazing animals, having those goals really clearly articulated beforehand is really going to determine the criteria that you use to choose where you farm. And, um, I can't, I can't understate that. It's so important that, um, that we, you know, actually build these practices, um, if possible, you know, I recommend folks start market farming before they buy land, before they, you know, bite off a big chunk of debt. Um, really one of the biggest pieces of course for market growing is, is being strategic about where you are relative to markets and thinking about what you want to grow and who's going to buy it. And are you in a position where a farm stand makes a lot of sense or where there's a tourism industry and there's a lot of restaurants serving really good food. So, um, doing that goals articulation as soon in the process as possible and continuing to do it, um, is critical. Um, holistic management also offers a really great toolkit for us in, in doing some goals articulation. And, um, after the session you may want to check in with Jesse. I'm not sure if they're still doing a whole farm planning course, but, um, for those of you who are in Vermont, there has been and I believe will be again, a, uh, a whole farm planning course which really helps farmers through, um, some of the business planning processes and, you know, making sure that those business plans really resonate with our, ourselves and our lives. Um, here we go. Thanks Jesse for the link. Um, one, one piece of the goals articulation process in holistic management that I want to share here is just this idea of uh, a house and thinking of our goals really as, as a house. The foundation being our core values and our ethics. Those things that we refuse to compromise on. And really being, doing a lot of introspection and thinking about, um, you know, why it is that you want to farm and making sure that your daily activities and all of the work that you do that you do in terms of chores and your work is kind of based on those ethics and values rather than compromising them. And then one of the pieces that I think is really unique, um, is of course the legacy and thinking about, in a permaculture perspective, intergenerational decision making. Like how we are leaving our farms and landscapes for future generations of people, whether they're our own ancestors or or not, um, in the holistic management process. Um, in the holistic management process one way of doing this is actually writing your obituary, which may seem morbid to folks but, um, it's actually, can be very fun. And to do this, I find, just really offers such incredible insight on, um, you know, writing down what we want to have said about us after we're gone. And then having that as a written document to refer to in our decision making process and, um, be able to make decisions based on that idea of legacy. Like, are these decisions going to support that legacy that we're trying to create? So, um, excuse me. In that vein of long term planning or intergenerational planning or intergenerational planning, or intergenerational thinking, um, there's a couple other things that I think, you know, are a part of where permaculture design came about in response to that are really critical for us as our growers and farmers to be considering in our farming plans. Um, most of you probably heard about peak oil and are somewhat familiar with it. I'm not going to go too in depth with it, but of course, reality at present, reality at present is that we're at a point in history where we probably have the most resources available to human beings at any time before or after. And for the whole arc of history, of course, you know, we've, we've had more resources available than previous generations have. But we're extremely novelly in the new situation of recognizing that we have more resources available to us than than previous generations had, excuse me, than future generations will. So, um, that's definitely something to take into consideration when we're thinking about our farm plans, um, not only on the annual basis, but on the five or ten year basis. And really recognizing that this provides an opportunity at present for us to invest energetic resources, to invest fossil fuels, to build some of the infrastructure that we may need, that may be more difficult to to build in the future. So, um, and this is really kind of where, um, my business is positioned to a degree in that we work with folks to establish greenhouses and food processing facilities and root sellers, which quite frankly are energetically intensive and, um, can be expensive. But when we look at the return on those investments over years, um, they're not going to get any cheaper to build. back the minute you build them. So, um, we'll look at some other examples of how we might invest fossil fuels into our systems. But, um, here's just, uh, another graph of the same kind of information. It also includes consumer debt load, which I think is really important piece because, um, when we're thinking long term, we also want to recognize that a lot of our farms at present are very dependent on global economic systems that are frankly, outside of our control and outside of our control and the challenge that we face as we move into the 21st century is how we make our farms and our communities, um, locally viable. And really, uh, food producers and land managers are at the centerpiece of this potential for, um, for resilient economies, for economies that are not dependent on the whims of the stock market. or foreign exchange, um, or foreign exchange, um, currency rates. So, um, that just sets some context as well. And then, of course, dealing with the reality of climate change, here we have a graph of our 1990 USDA hardness map. And, you know, again, anybody who's, who wants to just play with some of the interactive technology here, feel free to just, you know, throw your little dot on the map. And we'll look at how this changes from 1990 to 2006. Um, sorry, I just wiped away everyone's dot. But, um, I'll go back and do it again. We're seeing a pretty clear trend of moving hardiness zones. And in some areas of the country, that can mean actually cooler. Um, here in Vermont, there's very, very clear evidence that we're seeing. um, warmer weather. In the weather and wherever, everybody, little sunlight erwisem per year, we're seeing conditions et cetera. And, um, I just quickly reach out on the other hand index and we're installing STEPHANIE UNDERSTANCE AND I'VEALL LA 추okiThis year. But I'll say once a few years before I'm feeling clear evidence that we're seeing warmer weather and especially warmer winters as far as the objective records go. That has major implications for our food systems. When we look to the forecasts of climate we see this is New Hampshire but with aggressive reduced emissions scenarios where we implement carbon sequestration and reduced emissions we're still looking at New Hampshire behaving as the Virginias by the end of the century. Although more likely we're looking at New Hampshire behaving as the Carolinas. So these are all factors that we want to take into play as we think about what techniques we use, what crops we use, what strategies we employ and you know I'm not trying to be the the harbinger of doom here but the more closely we pay attention to climate scientists really the scarier this stuff gets, right? We're seeing here this kind of arc of temperature and just notice how close we are to temperatures that human beings have not lived on the planet in and then of course the forecast for our present emissions, climatic response to our present emissions. So I'm not trying to scare anyone here but I am trying to maybe do some goals articulation for all of us collectively in terms of the importance of making our farms carbon negative, of making our farms climate resilient because unfortunately with all of the forecasts and models out there honestly no predictions are going to be that accurate. Everything everything is unfolding more rapidly than was imagined and the only things that we can really be certain of are increased incidence of severe weather. We're going to see late frost, we're going to see early frost, we're going to see drought, we're going to see you know torrential downpour. Here in Vermont most of you are aware that we've seen secessions of record breaking floods just in the past few years and that's of course a major factor for me and for those of you who are just looking at the aerial photography on a farm you may have noticed that we're right in the river valley. Also now is that chance to invest fossil fuels to set up systems that don't need them as constant daily inputs in the future and whether that's investing in alternative energy systems or irrigation systems that and fertility cycling systems so that we are not stuck with our systems being completely dependent on things that are outside of our control. If your agricultural model involves for instance buying in a lot of grain you know that's fine to make sure that you're meeting your bills but you may want to be making a five or ten year plan to start producing more of your own feed or build relationships with other local producers that may help you in that because obviously not only the trucking but how having grain come from very far away just puts it in an increasingly fragile situation. Okay and then you know not least important is really thinking about how our economies are vibrant in local systems and really starting to weave these connections among local producers because honestly global economies are are outside of our control. The forecasts don't look good but that said I'm not trying to look into a crystal ball here but what I am saying is that we see healthy economies happening all over and we can make an intention to be a part of them more directly and to create these relationships among local producers and our local communities that really bring real economic health. Economic health is based on appropriate stewardship of resources and regeneration of resources as good farms are capable of resources as good farms are capable of doing. Okay and as you know we're seeing things like the Food Safety Modernization Act and all these other you know staples, commodities, debt speculation, all these things that are somewhat outside of our control are we are able to insulate ourselves to them as we build real relationships with real people on a face-to-face basis. You know it's very concerning. I'm sure many of you who are growers are paying a lot of close attention especially smaller growers are paying a lot of attention to the Food Safety Modernization Act and all of these certification processes even organic become less relevant when we know our customers, our customers know who we are and we're directly engaged. So when people know who we are and we're looking at the Food Safety Modernization Act and all of these things that are not necessarily going to be a part of our customers. So when people know who they can trust they all become necessary of course and that's the reason we're seeing the demand for these types of laws is because when food production is totally out of sight with zero relationship there's a lot of risk in terms of health. So let's take an opportunity now to build these relationships preemptively so that we're well positioned despite the frankly potentially corporate control of the the Money and tara successful group of the reasons. to build these relationships in terms of education. That's an organization now because this element is actually an organization that is enough to have made it attention to the rights or on this justiceial AC pictures. design process as a whole for a brief second if I can find the right slide. Yeah, sorry I drew all over it but so we're doing some goals articulation and let's presume we've done some base mapping. For most of you, you know, unfurling a big piece of paper and drawing a map of your farm by hand is going to suffice. Honestly, to do this at detail with scale for the big ideas is less important. Certainly as you get into some of the more detailed aspects like how many of a certain plant or how wide certain rows are, you're going to need to work at scale but for the big picture ideas, rough and out of scale is better than doing it to scale because I find, you know, if we try to make these maps too carefully we don't have as much fun just kind of throwing our ideas out on paper. But really the centerpiece of the process is better understanding our landscapes and that site analysis and assessment and we can do that through what's called the scale of permanence. And the scale of permanence is something that actually predates permaculture but it's a really great tool that we have to understand our leverage essentially. So starting from climate which is sure globally and societally wide we're impacting climate but on our own individual farms there's not much that our decisions affect how much rain we get in a year, how cold it gets during the winter, you know, where we are relative to the equator or poles and we're primarily responding to that. That's not something we're designing for. Whereas as we get down to the other end of the spectrum things like how our farm feels to people when they walk on or what it looks like is entirely under our control. And so this spectrum is basically from the most permanent aspects of our landscape down to the least permanent or I should say the ones that are most easily influenced by design. So that doesn't mean so we're designing in response to these aspects and then increasingly we're able to design these along our own goals. So starting with climate obviously things like average precipitation and rainfall are great but we want to look not just to averages but also to extremes and especially recently, you know, averages are great baseline information to pay attention to but we also want to know what is the most rain that we've ever had, what is the longest drought that we've ever had, what is the hottest that it's ever gotten, what is the coldest that it's ever gotten, and make our farms as resilient as possible not just to averages but also to extremes. And then of course as I think I've already made clear we really need to pay attention to how climate's changing and anticipate that and as part of our climate analysis. So here we see a more detailed hardiness zone map is an updated one for Vermont and we also see the Vermont state climate trends looking over the past 50 years which is showing pretty clear warming trend just based on the numbers as well as much more extreme warming during winter months forecast which might have some advantages for us as growers frankly but also have some disadvantages and as I mentioned earlier the reality of these forecasts is that the the the climate change is kind of a um it's it's almost a misleading phrase because it it seems to indicate kinda gradual unifying uniform benign predictable predictable, whereas I think this phenomenon is better understood as climate chaos or climate collapse. And I don't mean to say that things are hopeless, but I mean to say we really want to buffer ourselves from floods, we want to buffer ourselves from winds, we want to have as much diversity as possible in our crops and techniques so that something's always winning regardless of what's happening. You know, I'm here in northern Vermont in what's classically considered a zone 3 and we had bumper crops of peaches. And as far as I know they were the first peaches ever grown in the Lomaral Valley of Vermont and we just happened to have the right conditions during pollination that we had great fruit set and I'm not banking on having a peach crop every year, but it's pretty exciting and I think we all have a little room to do some experimentation in regards to variables. Okay. Alright. So Landform then is kind of our next most permanent after climate and let's see if I can get my little drawing thing here. Yes, perfect. So great. So obviously, you know, things like a basic, sorry folks, things like a basic topo map of course can be really really helpful information here, but really it might be a little bit more there's if you actually go into the little bit of a grabble and that's actually kind of a little bit better within the but really it might be that you just sit down and kind of draw everything that has anything to do with the landform of your farm. Steep ledges, where you see boulders or bedrock expressed, what's flat, what's steep, and kind of we're making these maps on, I make them on tracing paper so that I can overlay them one after another. This particular topo map is from Libremaps.org. It's the USGS topography, but it's huge contour intervals and honestly doesn't tell us very much about our farms. If you've ever had a survey done or if there's any surveys on record with having done a septic system or anything like that, these are going to be way more detailed and in some cases it's totally worth paying a surveyor or working with your USDA and your CS and might be able to support these things depending on what practices you're trying to do. So we recently actually, I'm sorry I wasn't able to upload it into the slideshow, but we recently had an actual, you know, microtopography made of our farm. And just kind of looking at these patterns of erosion and deposition and how that influences the big, big overlays of the way our farms work. Water, of course, is another one. And in the case of my particular farm, what we're looking at overlaid here is essentially the floodplain and you can kind of see in the layout of crops, as you can see in the layout of crops, we're kind of on these islands in the floodplain, which is fortunately positioned that way because we've had opportunity to observe multiple hundred year floods and in the past few years we've seen two or three five hundred year floods. And one of the main efforts of our farm is to be reforesting buffers so that our more sensitive production, some of the more valuable crops are protected. So when we put water and landform together, we end up with a wide variety of techniques, but what we're looking at here is an image of what's called key line design. Specifically we're looking at Mark Shepherd's farm in Wisconsin whose, this was farm, this was cornfield, this was bare black dirt when he started. And the entire layout is arranged over very nuanced expressions of topography. And key line design is again another topic that's kind of a whole webinar in and of itself. But long story short, what we're looking at is managing water as it moves off our landscape. So instead of our kind of conventional management, which is shunting water to a drainage ditch where it flows off the farm as quickly as possible, we're spreading it out along, so basically the flow of the hills in this direction and as rainwater rolls over the farm, instead of gaining speed and momentum and carrying soil off, it is spread across the farm. And these ditches are actually not, they're not really ditches, but they're, these, they are like kind of plow lines that are not actually on contour, they are slightly off contour so that water is being better distributed towards the dry ridges and making it more even. Also, of course, tremendously preventing erosion. Also, of course, instead of having all that water fly off of our farms when we get tons of rain and minutes dry, it's storing that water in our systems and basically working like a battery so that we're between heavy rain and periods of dry, we're way balanced in the middle. So here's Mark Shepherd here and in these rows of trees, he's growing oaks, sweet acorn oaks, he's growing chestnuts, he's growing hazelnuts, he's grazing animals, he's on rotation doing annual vegetables. It's a really great example of kind of farm scale permaculture design. So here's just a little bit more of what Keyline can look like. This is in Australia where, you know, water scarcity is a major issue, especially on pasture land. And this is Keyline where the Keyline management is specifically diverting water into these ponds, which are then able to be released as passive irrigation. So no pumps, just entirely gravity by holding water as high as possible in the landscape. For many of us, this may not necessarily mean ponds, but it could mean something like a water tank. In fact, we just recently were siting a livestock shelter at a farm for some friends and decided to put the livestock shelter on the highest possible part of the landscape. We put it basically on the top of the hill. And we did that because we put a huge roof on the livestock shelter, which A, made for a nice shady space for the animals in the summer. It's open walled with the open wall facing south so that it creates this warm microclimate for the animals during the winter months. And that whole roof area is used to fill a giant, it's a 2,000 gallon water tank, which fills almost instantly. I think most of us aren't aware of how much rain really comes in an event. So you're going to get approximately .6 gallons per inch of rain per square foot of roof area. So you do the math on that 100 square feet, which is an incredibly small building, you're going to get about 60 gallons of water just of 100 square feet. So you put a thousand or a few thousand gallon water tank there. And in the case of this instance, we had all the water needs for the livestock there from the rainwater catchment without having to run plumbing up there. And then we had, because it was at the top of the hill, the ability to run a hose out of it to any other parts of the garden or pasture completely passively without any pumps. So there's another example of key line design. And then another aspect of key line is the key line plow. And this is how these ditches can be made to manage the water, as I said. And they're also used, of course, to deepen topsoil and bring the organic and biologic components of soil a little bit deeper, which is being used with incredible success by an organization known as Carbon Farmers. And Carbon Farmers are essentially quantifying to what degree they're sequestering atmospheric carbon in their soil simply by deepening their topsoil. And, of course, it makes plants more productive. It makes pastures healthier. And it holds incredible promise for sequestration of atmospheric carbon. Okay. So vegetation and wildlife is another, we're not necessarily going through every layer of the scale of permanence, but I encourage you to, you know, if you come back and view this slide show, you know, you can go to slides like this and also I'll direct you towards some resources where these things can be found online. But essentially every single one of these needs to be thought about very, very carefully and then put together. And it's a lot of fun to do. It does take time, but it's time that's infinitely worthwhile. And as we overlay these different things as different maps, we find that no matter how intimately familiar we are with our farms and landscapes, you'll come to new discoveries. You're going to learn. And one of the reasons I like to do it with tracing paper is, of course, as I overlay different layers on top of each other, for instance, microclimate on top of vegetation and wildlife, I may find why there's different ecological communities on different parts of the farm. More obviously, I may come to understand why we're seeing some of these differences, especially water and access. You know, as we overlay those, we may learn the catchment area that's really coming through a culvert or something like that and better understand why we're seeing roads flow out and have some different opportunities for management. Okay. So, vegetation and wildlife is one of the bigger ones and one of the more complex ones. It's one, you know, you can spend a lot of time just, you know, identifying the vegetation on your farm. You can look things up in field guides, which is really great. One process that I really like is using field guides of natural communities, which are a little bit different than the field guides that you might use for, say, identifying an individual tree or shrub or wildflower. Field guides to natural communities are field guides to the groups of plants and animals and how they interact, which is very, very helpful for us when we're doing broad scale farm design, to understand exactly what ecological communities that a farm once was or could be. In the case of my farm here, as we look at islands like this and we look at the semblance of vegetation that was left on this hay field, this would key out as what's called the sugar maple ostrich fern floodplain forest. So, that's an incredibly valuable tool for us to use as a point of inspiration. On the one hand, it shows me, okay, that, you know, we already have very valuable vegetation in the older story and the under story, both sugar maples and fiddleheads or ostrich ferns. But, more importantly, it allows me to do what we call ecological analogs. So, as we determine which plants we are looking in as crops, we can look, for instance, to the butternut, which is Jugland sinera, one of the native nut trees to this community. However, the butternut is subject to a blight and they're diseased. So, we're working at hybridizing the butternut with the Japanese walnut, the heartnut, to create something that's a little bit more valuable to us, a little bit more resilient. That said, we're still planting butternuts. We have a lot of hope for them. And, as we go on with this hybridization, we're finding some of the ones most suitable to our specific place. Another kind of half-step analog, of course, is the black walnut. And, as we're looking at climate change, we're also, of course, anticipating warmer weather and experimenting even with the Carpathian walnut, which I wouldn't necessarily recommend spending a lot of money investing in if you're in northern Vermont, but by all means potentially experimenting with. It's the Carpathian walnut being typically not hardy, but one of the more valuable in terms of walnut production. It's, you know, the walnuts that you buy in the supermarket are almost entirely jugglin's auregia, the Carpathian walnut. And the shag bark hickory, Caria ovana, and even Caria ilionensis, which is our pecan. And, quote-unquote, you can't grow pecans in Vermont, but my pecan trees haven't read the books. So they are doing fine and we'll see, you know, whether we're going to be getting nuts ripening in our short season. We're not banking on them, we're not planting them entirely, but I think I really just want to drive around in a nut shaker, which is one of the reasons why I'm planting so many nut trees. But also, of course, because of where my farm is, in terms of floods. So let's actually go to the kind of overall concept of the farm a little bit, which is, you know, we're still doing some annual production, we're still doing some tillage, but all of that tillage is contextualized in the establishment of what we're calling productive buffers. Now, any buffer is good and there's some great programs out there to subsidize and support folks reforesting along the river's edge, but they're pretty strictly purely native plants that are not productive. And that's good, but when you look at the finances, a lot of farmers, of course, are somewhat reluctant to enter these relationships because their crops may be much more valuable than their buffers. But when we're looking at high value lumber, when we're looking at nuts, fruits, medicinal herbs, vines, berries, it may take a few more years, but we're looking at things that are actually yielding more value in the long run than any crop they'd be growing in the river's edge, but with permanent roots. So I'm very excited about the potential for reforesting agriculture, but by no means do I mean to say that, you know, all of our farms are totally reforested. It's always going to take shape completely differently based on every different farm and every different farmer's goals. For our farm, it is high value fruits, nuts, medicines, and vines and berries, especially concentrated in the areas that are prone to erosion. We're working with the Anglers Association who recognize the ability to shade the stream and prevent nutrients from the river and prevent nutrients from washing into the river. And most importantly for us, as floods come through our farm, having these buffers established prevents immediate physical damage from flotsam or woody debris or icebergs, which we see pretty regularly, and also makes for incredible habitat. So this was an earlier draft of our design, and we see here kind of a more recent one, a more recent one, and this one was a map done specifically for our irrigation plan, but if you look in the upper portion, I'm not sure if that's too small to be read, but you can see kind of our layout and how, what I'm getting at when I'm stressing this idea of a design concept, which is to say that, of course, it's important to plan your rotations and to have things spaced at the right distance, but more importantly, thinking about the big picture of the parts of our farm and how they fit together as an organism as a whole. So, and how are animals able to integrate with some of our other production systems. For instance, here we see one of our production rows of hazelnuts. In the fall, as the hazelnuts are ripening, we fence our chickens in, which completely weed the plants, fertilize the plants, and prevent squirrel predation, as well as being kind of isolated in the areas of high activity, which really limits how much squirrels are willing to risk getting across the farm. Which kind of leads me to introduce another one of our design principles, which is zones of use, which is essentially a tool looking at like our daily patterns of activity on a farm. Starting out, you know, in your bedroom when you wake up and thinking about how our chores unfold based on our normal daily activity. And if you find yourself, you know, needing to cross the entire farm to get to the dairy barn or the greenhouse or some of these high maintenance tasks, you're spending a lot of time and energy that's not that productive. And maybe you're not able to move your barn or greenhouse, but you can make the path from your door to there where your main garden rows are, so that as you're walking through them, you're able to at least keep an eye on things, if not even pull some weeds or do some harvesting. And really, as much as possible, lay our farms out along the putting things which need the most attention in the places where they're going to get it. One of the reasons undoubtedly that we had such success with our peaches is I put my peach in a place where I walk by it every single day. And I have a few trees and the ones that I don't see, they don't get watered when it's dry, they don't get thinned. Whereas the one that I was walking by day in and day out, if a bug was biting a peach, I noticed it, I picked that one off. If there was a vole starting to eat the bark, which did happen to one of the ones kind of out of the way, I was able to respond to that immediately. So put things that need care and attention in the places where they're naturally going to get it as much as possible. I think we can kind of start to summarize and I might like to provide an opportunity for any other comments or questions before we end. But most importantly, I just want to encourage you to make maps, have a lot of fun, kind of draw out your dreams, and really think things through. You know, design can be intimidating, but it's also an incredible amount of fun. And, you know, it's iterative. We're always learning and we're always making mistakes. But when we can make those mistakes on paper, it saves us a lot of time, energy, and resources. And get out in the landscape and, you know, use some stakes and flagging. And if you're thinking about, you know, where you might site your barn or greenhouse or one of your next rows, maybe flag it or stake it first and walk by it for a few weeks and really feel it out. I'm planning on building a barn at my farm right now and I staked the four corners and had it there to the point that I saw the barn and people would be, you know, walking across this open area of grass and I was like, oh, you're standing in my barn. And what happened, one day I pulled in with a trailer behind my truck and I couldn't make the turn without clipping the corner of the barn. However, fortunately, the corner of the barn was simply a wooden stake that hadn't been constructed yet. And I was able to kind of accept that feedback and learn that the position of the barn needed to move if I wanted to continue to access that one route, the truck and trailer. So as we close on these images here, I just want to share the Akogi farm, which is in Putney, Vermont. Really, absolutely inspiring pioneers in growing rice in Vermont. And Mr. Akogi, you know, Japanese-born American who reads Japanese and has been reading all the research that has happened in the past few years to bring rice to the northern islands of Japan. And these are areas of their farm that would have otherwise been considered unproductive, kind of spongy fields. This is, you know, what they look like in the early season, turned into some of the most beautiful, productive, and profitable areas of their farm. So the more we can kind of think through how problems might be made into solutions and how all these pieces integrate and reciprocate to feed off of each other, the more resilient our farms become. So anyway, we're nearly closing. If there are any last comments or questions, feel free to throw them in the box there. Sorry we only had an hour. Obviously, it's kind of a teaser. There's a lot of information to try to fit, but I hope you found it worthwhile. And stay tuned to the UVM Extension webinars. Next week is going to be one on shiitake mushrooms, which I'm excited about. And here Jessie shares our link for feedback. So, yeah. Great, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you so much for joining us. Hey, everyone. Thanks for joining us. And thank you so much, Keith, for being with us. And we really appreciate all the information you shared. Tina Barney had a question. Hi, Tina. She said, do current use reviewers recognize permaculture principles as valid and supported? And for those of you outside of Vermont, current use is a regulation that values property for agriculture use and has tax implications. Keith, do you have any experience with that? Yeah, thanks. So current use definitely values having design on paper. So they, you know, they definitely, it depends, which is really kind of the answer to all regulatory questions, right? But if you have a working plan, you definitely need to be producing something, whether it's, you know, whether it's pasture, hay, apples, berries, even timber. But the better recorded you have that and the better documented you have any planning or planting or implementation, the easier it's going to be to get current use. Great. And Mike Gibson asks about young nut trees and looking for a good place to purchase them. And also, do you grow yours from cuttings or do you purchase your trees? Yeah, great. So we have a nursery, Mike, that's become one of the biggest growing parts of our farm is selling young trees, particularly the hazels where we are now at the point of nut production with our hazelnuts that we're, you know, we're planting our seed out from our own trees that we've collected. In terms of some of the walnuts and chestnuts and pine nuts and other nuts like that, we both collect seed, we do buy in some nuts. But my website is prospectrock.org, which you might want to check out. We're going to be doing some of our nursery sales. And depending on where you are, you know, feel free to send me an email because if you're not in Vermont, I may know of some other reputable nut nurseries. It's a really exciting crop for me and for us. It does take a little bit of time to get established, but we've started, you know, really carefully running the numbers and the return on investment after a few years is better than most things. Great, Keith, thanks. And I know that some work has been done on permaculture and looking, doing financial projections for permaculture-based farms. Can you let people know about that resource? Because I know that for farmers, a lot of them want to be able to look at financial projections and better understand how these things are going to contribute to their bottom line. Yeah, it's pretty nascent, but there is, you know, some growing documentation. And it's at this point somewhat crop-based. There's some records that I'm aware of. There's a real body of records growing with Saskatoon in Canada. And, you know, so all your Amelancher, your Juneberries and your, you know, Shadbush or whatever you want to call them, Elderberry. There is, I'm sorry that I don't have it off the top of my head, but there is a database, which again, maybe if you want to just try and send me an email, I could see if I could share the link for what is, So that's what basically got some accounting spreadsheets for a couple of different enterprises. Great. Well, thank you very much. I see that some people might be having trouble with our SurveyMonkey link requiring a sign in. I'll have to double check on that. It shouldn't. So try the link again when you get a chance. But I'm going to wrap up now and say thanks to everybody for joining us. Keith, thank you so much for taking the time to put this together. And we look forward to seeing everyone on future webinars. Have a great afternoon. Thanks, Jesse. And thanks, everyone.
