 This morning is about nutrient management practices on small livestock farms. I'm not going to get a lot of detail about how to actually do a nutrient management plan on a small farm. I guess that's going to probably vary from source to source to source, but I want to talk about some practices we've found or I've found that I think are good guidelines that small farms ought to be following and good recommendations we can make. I guess the biggest question is what do you think is a small farm? It's kind of soup to nuts in a way. Here's 25 goats. Here's a couple hundred dairy cows that are grazing. There's a few chickens on a farm that happened to be pretty much a menagerie for fowl. 500 milking ewes. This is a pretty cool farm. I've been there lots of times. They produce artisan cheese for a very high end market. If you want to spend $35 a pound for cheese, you should come to that farm. A 35 sow farm. Some beef cows, 65 or 70 head. A breeding farm of horses. So a small farm kind of across the board a little bit. So I'm not going to throw out a question for you here, but I'd like you to think just what makes a small farm small could be acreage. Sometimes farms on small farms are very, very limited acreage. They're small. You know, 20 goats on five farms, I guess that would qualify as a small farm. Animal numbers sometimes low. But again, that can vary. 150 cal dairy farm would be considered small in much of the country. And in some parts of the country it would be considered quite large. Small farms may have a special kind of a market they're producing for. Some kind of a niche market. Small farm meat being produced for a specialty trade of some kind. Height? Well, I'm just joking there. Five foot two, I guess, would be height. Well, this is the USDA answer for a small farm. A small farmer is defined as one that grows and sells between $1,000 and $250,000 per year in agricultural products. Again, that's a nice big range to look at. 250,000, what's that? 75 dairy cows? You know, is that about right? I think that's probably in the realm of what it might be, maybe 100 dairy cows. So, $1,000, I guess below that we'd be looking more at maybe kind of a hobby farm. And this is going to vary by states. A lot of states are going to have farmland tax assessments that are going to require a certain amount of income to qualify for that farmland tax assessment. In our state, we only required $500 of income to actually qualify for farmland tax assessments. In some other states, it might be quite a bit more than that. So again, that's the USDA definition. This comes off of USDA's website. They kind of divide between more of a, let's just call residential or I don't want to use the term hobby farms, but retirement farms, lifestyle farms. There's an occupation there other than just farming. And then more of what we'd call an intermediate family farm, probably still less than that $250,000 in gross. They report farming as their major occupation. Low sales farms might have less than $100,000 in sales. High sales farms between $100,000 and $250,000 in sales. So it's a pretty broad look we're looking at. This is kind of interesting. From the 2007 census of farms, if you look at that $250,000 from less than $10,000 to up to $250,000, 60% of all those farms, of all farms, not just the $250,000 farms, 60% of all farms are less than $10,000 of sales. Okay, six in 10 farms have less than $10,000 in sales. Land and farms, well that's lower, 18%. Cattle inventory, 9%. Horse inventory, 65% of our horse farms are on those less than $10,000 of income. And oftentimes I wonder where horse income comes from. I'm not sure so much in my state how they're actually making money unless they're part of other kind of endeavors on the same farm. Okay, we may use another governmental recommendation and this would be the EPA approach. You know we're all familiar with CAFOs, small CAFOs, medium CAFOs. The small CAFO would be less than 300 head of beef, veal or dairy, less than 200 dairy cattle, less than 750 swine that are greater than 55 pounds, 3,000 swine less than 55 pounds, 16,500 turkeys, 37,000 chickens, 3,000 sheep, 150 horses. So by the EPA standard that would be what they would consider to be a small farm. I'd like to maybe talk about what I'll call small farm distinctives for just a little bit. Generally smaller farms are going to have less animals, fewer animals, and because of that they're going to have less waste to handle. Okay, they might have some other problems related to having that waste, but they're going to have less waste to handle. They're not going to have the volume that, or the amount that other farms have. Quite often they don't have a suitable storage structure. I know that most small farms that I go on in my state, they probably, they may have a designated area for manure. It all goes here, it all goes in the woods. But quite often they don't have any kind of a designated structure unless they've gotten generally in some sort of government program that helps them get a structure. They probably have less land available for grazing. They probably have less land available for spreading. In fact when it comes to most horse farms, they don't want to spread it anyway, they want to get rid of it. If they can they just haul it offside. And generally operators have less experience in waste management. They're closer to neighbors, probably. They're often located in some small regions or a locale where they may be totally surrounded by an urban area. So they might have more neighbor concerns than someone else is going to have. They probably have a limited budget for manure handling and storage. However, in some areas, you know, some farmers tend to be more affluent and would have income or dollars for that. They might have the option of disposing manure offside. Now this is something that larger farms probably don't have such an option for. They might, but a lot of small farms would, if they can, they'd like to haul it offside. Unfortunately, sometimes offside means in a dumpster that gets hauled to the landfill. Sometimes it might mean just store it off in the woods somewhere. Composting might be an option. In fact, a lot of small farmers, you'll ask if they compost and they say, oh yeah, I compost. But I think generally there's not a lot of understanding what compost means. It might, to some people it might mean that I keep it in a pile for a year and after it rots, I try to get somebody to come and pick it up. So that wouldn't really be composting. Less aware of manure management BMPs? Probably so. I put a question mark there because I think oftentimes newer or beginning farmers are more open to waste management ideas than maybe some more established farmers are. They're new, they want to learn, and they might be more interested and more willing to make some changes. Let's go back to this that I'm sure we've all seen this diagram many times or similar diagrams that we've got nutrients coming onto a farm. We've got nutrients that are exiting the farm. We've got nutrients that are causing balances or imbalances in the soil. Now I think it's, I think actually getting farmers to address if they're a small farm with not a lot of acreage, getting them to accept the idea of actually spreading and managing and nutrient management plans on farms is probably going to be kind of difficult. But I think we can focus on things like imbalances, ways they can get around that concern. And of course manure storages are one of the ways we can do that. Now these are some guidelines we use on small farms in our state. In fact we use these guidelines for all farms in New Jersey but most of our farms are on the smaller side anyway. So, and this is the basic of our nutrient management requirements within the state. But I think they're a good set of guidelines. Our first point is we always encourage our producers to store their manure in a dry, level, impermeable location or as impermeable as possible free from stormwater runoff. Location should be at least 100 feet from waters or wetlands. That comes right off of our state regulations. So I think that's a good thing we can look at on small farms. If they don't have good storages now we can encourage them to at least consider how they're storing their manure. Secondly, each farm should have a plan for managing manure spreading and disposal. Now disposal, if disposal is an option then I think farmers, small farms should be encouraged to do that. So, we have a number of centralized, small centralized composting areas in our state which pick up mostly horse manure but they get manure from other sources as well. But it's all small farm manure. They compost it and then they market it as mulch. So, managing stormwater. So, so your water stays out of, out of your manure pad, out of your manure storage. Might require the use of some buffers or some vegetative filters and I'll show you some slides in a couple moments of that. Controlling animal access to streams and waterways. Again, that's right, right out of our state regulations. And again, sometimes animals have to have access to waterways if they, or streams if that's their only source of water consumption. So, but that includes fencing, maybe some stream crossings, controlling farm erosion, and finally being aware of those neighbor concerns. We asked a survey of horse farmers, how many of them dispose of manure off farm. Over 40% of them dispose of manure off the farm. I mentioned to you a centralized composter. This is a guy that does that. He comes, he's in the northern part of the state. He comes and he does a variety of things. He'll do a, he'll do a, if you've got manure stacked up for 10 years, he'll come and he'll, he'll haul it off and he'll compost it. And he has regular contracts with certain farmers where he'll leave a dumpster at the farm, a roll off, and he'll pick it up on a regular basis. Manure storage. Now, again, sometimes smaller farms don't have a lot of dollars. They may not be able to put up a, a storage that has a roof on it or proper, a proper storage for solid manure. So, what this farmer's done is he's got a, he's put down a, mostly a gravel pad which is a, three sides on it. It's a relatively impermeable base or we hope that it is. It's a hundred feet from waters or wetlands. And it's, um, got a vegetative filter on the back side of it. So I think that's a good recommendation for a small farm. They don't have to put up an elaborate, uh, concrete pad. Um, they can put up a relatively simple structure like this that allows them to store their manure. Want them to keep water out of, uh, uh, their animals out of water. There's a, there's a dry lot just to the right there which was a, you know, a muddy mess. So they shouldn't have been storing their manure, um, the way they were, um, right by that stream. Which is in a sensitive watershed anyway. Um, this is a, a farm that had several hundred horses. Um, he thought he had a good system there. You know, had woods on the one side, woods on the other, a graveyard on the other side. And, uh, and that's what his storage looked like. It was a mess. Now he's changed that subsequently. Made some changes but, uh, the waterway on the side there. So I guess if you're talking the good, the bad, and the ugly, this is probably ugly. Um, this is a, a, a farm we assisted a few years ago. They had previously stored all their, all their manure, um, on, on one, on one field right along a ditch. Uh, which ended in, uh, ended up going into a string. So we came in and we helped them put up this, this small composting, uh, uh, pad that you see. Which, uh, certainly took away some of their concerns. This is actually on our campus, uh, for our horse farm. You know, we've, I like, I want to point out that nice vegetative buffer on the, on the downward side of the, of the storage. So, again, the storage doesn't, it needs to be adequate and sized to meet your needs. But we've got a 35 well, well vegetated buffer, uh, to uptake nutrients that come out of that storage. So I'm not, for small farms, I'm not a big proponent of, of roofs on storage, small storages. Maybe in certain environments, rainfall, et cetera, you, you, you have to consider that. But I, I think there's other things that can be, uh, considered that are more cost effective. Okay, where to store and spread, again, you have to make, um, proper investigations of your area. Um, streams, lakes, aquifers, slopes for spreading, neighbors. Now, here's something that, that, that I will generally tell people, that on a small farm, if you're spreading manure on a small farm, I don't think it really does you any good to take a lot of manure samples, uh, for your spreading. Particularly if you're spreading every day, um, you might, you might spread over the, you might take samples over the course of a year and come up with a baseline. But in general, I think using book values is probably, uh, about as good as you're going to get, uh, for an accurate, uh, estimate, um, on a smaller farm. Okay, here's a, a spreader. That's a spreader for you. A Mill Creek spreader being pulled by a, uh, um, by, uh, uh, an ATV vehicle. And there are plenty of these, uh, Mill Creek spreaders available, uh, at least in our area, farmers who, who use these. I think we should always be encouraging farmers, kind of regardless of their size, to develop a farm map. I think they ought to have an idea of what's what and what's where on their farm. They need to know where the water's at. Um, they need to know where the slopes are. And based on that, they need to, they need to be able to make it, uh, some, uh, adjustments and some, um, plans about where they're going to spread and where they're not going to spread. Now, if they don't have a, a map such as this, which they can probably get for the local soil conservation district or NRCS or, you know, Google Maps for that matter. Um, there's a number of sources they can get decent maps from. They can draw their own. Um, that's, but they need to have some idea of where their manure is, um, going and how they're managing their farm. So, um, sacrifice areas. Now, I mentioned I'm a pretty big proponent of storages. I'm also a big supporter of sacrifice areas if you can. Now, what's sacrifice areas? Is that where I'm going to kill my sheep? No, that's not. Um, some people might call it an exercise lot or a rest lot or a dry lot. Um, it's an area where our animals can kind of congregate. We can feed them in that spot. We can water them in that spot. They could have some shelter in that area. It could be a semi-confined area, which would probably let them have some, some access to pastures and, and grazing areas that are outside of that lot. Um, sometimes we would include what we call a heavy use pad around the waterers especially. Um, which is, we've excavated some of the dirt around it. We put in some kind of a geotextile pad. And then maybe a couple of different layers of stone to, uh, eliminate the mud that would be around the watering area. Um, to use a sacrifice area on your farm. And, um, about half of our producers, uh, uh, said that they did of some kind. This is horse producers again. And here's a, not a real good, uh, thing to, to kind of, uh, not a good kind of a sacrifice area to have. Just one great big lot where they graze and they feed and they water the same place. Here's kind of the idea. And I got this out of a, of a publication from, I think it was University of Kentucky. Kind of a, you know, you've got your dry, uh, dry lot area and then, um, where your animals are. And then you have fences out to your rotational pastures. But I think we, we did a survey recently looking at, uh, nutrient management practices on horse farms. Especially looking at feed management. And I think the things we, one of the things I came out of it with is that sacrifice areas and rotational grazing. If you can get farmers, horse producers to do those things, that's good. I mean, those are, those are good management practices that, uh, hopefully they'll follow. Again, of course, good, uh, well-managed pastures are always going to take up more nutrients than, uh, poorly, poorly managed pastures. And, of course, you get that whole recycling thing going, um, with your horses, with animals in general. Poorly vegetated pastures are not going to take up, uh, as many nutrients. Um, erosion I mentioned. So, when, when that's a possibility, uh, stream crossings are, are, are possible. NRCS can help design these and maybe help fund them too. Okay, again, I went through those, those kind of, uh, six areas. Storage, disposal and spreading, stormwater management, um, access to streams and waterways, erosion, neighbors. And finally, just kind of putting it all together. Small farms can have some unique challenges because of, um, their size. Both acreage and animal numbers. There's not enough land for spreading. There's probably a lack of understanding of nutrient management requirements. Lack of familiarity with BMPs. It may be located, uh, in, in, uh, or near populated areas. Those, those neighbors, those urbanized neighbors that might surround us, they probably don't, many of them don't have a good understanding of what we do and why we do it. Um, it may be able to dispose of waste off-site, which is, which is positive. Provide it's not going to landfill. Um, and beginning of new farmers may willingly make changes. Again, I think that, that's a possibility. Um, small farmers, uh, small, small farmers don't always fit existing models that might work for a, a larger farm for manure management. So patience is required. And if you want to see a nice fact sheet on, uh, on nutrient management, go to the e-extension website and you'll find a, a fact sheet there by a guy named Randall, Randall James, I think it is. He's done a nice little program for how you manage, uh, manure on a small farm. And, and opposed to looking at it as just so many pounds produced per given time period. He does it by, by time. Okay. My cows produce so many, so many, so much manure per, per two months. So two months storage goes here, two months storage goes here. So it's a, take a look at it. It's, it's helpful. Any questions? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
