 The concept of greenhouses dates back to ancient civilizations, particularly the Romans who created rudimentary versions to protect plants. They constructed the first known greenhouses, called specularia, using transparent mica to trap sunlight and regulate temperature. Similarly, in China, during the Han Dynasty, structures made from bamboo and glass-like materials were used to grow medicinal plants year-round. These innovations allowed for enhanced agricultural productivity. Ancient Egyptians also utilized sunshades to cultivate plants in hot environments, demonstrating early insights into controlled growing environments. These pioneering efforts laid the groundwork for modern greenhouse practices, showcasing humanity's enduring relationship with nature.
