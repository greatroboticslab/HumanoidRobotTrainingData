Science & Technology
 working within the context of your ecosystem as indigenous peoples did, instead of trying to disrupt or manipulate or re-engineer the ecosystem. So I see in modern agriculture with new biotechnologies, certain kinds of equipment that we're continuing to redesign and influence the ecosystem. However, more and more is becoming not sustainable for growing populations. And that's a recipe for disaster. And so honoring the differences in our ecosystems, which allows us to farm in different ways to respect that. Because the desert in Southwest, you know, US compared to Nebraska, where I live is completely different. Our farm is different from the cow-calf operations in the short grass prairie of the Nebraska sandhills. Just a little ways away is a completely different situation that we're dealing with. And so you got to respect that and manage based on the types of soils, the kind of rainfalls and what really grows in your area. And so we're learning more about what grew from the indigenous people and then reincorporating that.
