 Nice. Hey there, welcome back to the homestead. Today I'm working on setting up our off-grid garden irrigation system. This is a kit I got online on Amazon. I'll put a link down below. There's also some extra parts that I got. I'll also put links for those. If you watch the tank video, there's an irrigation ditch up there and it feeds this tank and my garden is not much lower than this tank. So I don't have enough pressure with gravity to give me my drip system the pressure that it needs. So I got this well pump. We'll go over that a little bit later. And a solar charging system that will hopefully give me the pressure that I need to do a drip system. And basically I can just set it and forget it. So let's get started. So let's get started. So let's get started. I'm going to write you and you'll find out your work to other elements. Within three minutes vintage FTSE in origin nice so we got the system all set up we'll go through it real quickly basically what we got here on the front we'll start with the structure this was just an old crate that I came on a project I was working on with a pallet and sides so I used one of the sides and I used the pallet seemed to work out pretty well on that is two 100 watt solar panels for a total of 200 watts just did some brace in here just hold them up and then those holes are for the wires to come through let's take a peek inside the kit that I had gotten came with the two solar panels the charge controller and the solar pump or in the well pump along with assorted wires and all that so we'll check out the charger basically what it does it takes the solar panel power and you plug it in here that charges the battery and also gives power to the load the load in this case is going to be that well pump over here is a timer 12 volt timer what that is doing is basically if if I didn't have the timer the pump would just run continuously until the battery went dead or we'll go over the setup on this real quick the white wire here this red and then there's a black back there that is feeding the timer it needs a little bit of power to run so I'm just robbing some power off the load side to give that some juice and then I'm taking the positive side this red wire there and feeding that to the timer and then off that that white wire there is running to the pump and then the negative is just this and it just runs all the way through to the pump so that is the oh and then the battery is just a marine grade battery a deep cell nothing too special just the I think I did group 24 so 70 to 85 amp hours not really too sure how well it's gonna work but I think it should get us where we want to be at this time the Sun is a little cloudy out there so there's not too much Sun out but we are doing 13.2 volts the solar panel is charging the battery and then the load is operational but right now because of the timer the pump is not running I just have it on manually off let's go take a look at the pump okay so the way I ran it through the hole in the tank lid I have a rope the power wire and a half inch drip line hose I pulled the pump out so that we can have a little look it's got a half inch barbed fitting back there oh I put a pipe clamp on there hose clamp also put a rope on there so I'm not tugging on the fitting there or also the power line it's a pretty neat little setup stainless steel they have so many options of this I went with this one because it is a higher GPM 3.2 GPM and I wanted that for more gallons per minute and also pressure just a quick peek inside the tank what I got it here is a float valve basically once the water comes up to a certain level the float floats and turns off the water coming from the ditch up there let's dunk this tank real quick or the pump we'll fire it up so this has a auto on and off might be able to hear it a little noisy there's some vibration in there for sure I did put a pressure gauge on here so right now I'm going to turn on the pressure gauge because now it's running to the drip system and what happens here is it has a lot of pressure so that gauge goes over to a hundred and as you've seen the needle just went all the way around drip system that I have here is set up for 10 psi and I wasn't thinking I would even get as much psi as I'm getting now but yeah this is actually a lot better than I thought I'm actually gonna have to get a regulator so yeah let's go take a look at the drip system so now I got the drip going and now it starts to rain what I'm doing here is I'm gonna do two two separate zones there is nine beds I'm gonna separate them into like four and five two lines running this way I haven't set these beds up yet but I really wanted to see how this thing worked so I did set up these four beds here the material that I'm using for the drip system is known as drip tape I guess they call it that because it lays flat and it has these little slits right here so this setup is designed to do one our 40 gallons per hour per hundred foot so these are 50 foot beds each bed has two lines which mean it has a hundred foot of drip line and then what happens when it gets pressure which I think these are over pressured for sure it round it rounds up like normal irrigation tubing what I'm using for the header is just typical black irrigation pipe your standard drip irrigation you know the stuff you get at the Home Depot or whatever is capable of doing much more pressure I wasn't thinking I was gonna have this much pressure so that's why I went with this drip tape setup and you can see it drip in there I'm gonna put the camera away because it is raining but I do want to set this set up over here and have you watch me so let me see if the rain will pass reach out to the top from the sides I previously kept passing somebody the s√∫rge. Wow they didn't burn there's a tomato headache project near now by now near now I went to look for networks all ederim thats I believe I believe is you job you Alrighty, well, that over there is a storm. Got a few more plumbing fittings to set up. So, I'm going to put the camera away before it gets soaking wet. Thanks for watching. We'll see you on the next one.
