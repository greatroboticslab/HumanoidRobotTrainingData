 Well hello there everyone coming to you from home today this is April 16th 2020 web presentation for the Eastern Ohio grazing council we're going to talk to you today a little bit about grazing terminology and definitions and I got to admit when I started thinking about doing this topic it was because I just come back from the Western Pennsylvania grazing conference and they had talked about some things there that I wasn't quite sure what the definition was and so I figured how better than to look up definitions or try to figure out what those things were and to also put them in presentation form for all of you and then as I did the presentation I thought boy you know maybe we're going a little too basic but I'll tell you as I did the research and kind of look through some other terminology I really found out that I learned a lot myself had some some grazing epiphanies along the way and really enjoyed putting this one together I will say that that I put a really big presentation together and I ran through it once and it was going to be almost an hour long so I've cut it way down and we'll probably have to pick up some other grazing terminology somewhere on down the road but we'll go ahead and get started okay first I wanted to talk about the management definitions or the management descriptions of grazing but first let me say that there's no real written down definition of a lot of the terms we're going to discuss here and so you're getting the Clint Vinnie version of each of these terms or words that we use and I may not be exactly right but it's the best that I can find and the best that I can put together certainly we can do some more research and some more thinking and talking about what each one of these terms means to us as we go through this presentation but first one on the list there management intensive grazing will always be shown as capital M small i capital G and and that's because when Jim Garish coined the phrase management intensive grazing he wanted all the focus for intensity to be on management and not on grazing we want our management to be intensive and not the grazing it's real easy to have intensive grazing you put too many animals in too small a space and leave them for too long a time and that's intensive grazing or what we would call over grazing but we want our management to be intensive it's the management that we make intensive for the grazing so management intensive grazing is all about the forage and letting it get to the correct height before we graze it removing the animals when they get to the residue we're shooting for so bluegrass two inches three inches what's your grass fescue four inches of residue and removing the animals moving them on to another paddock there being a rotation involved there rotating to a new paddock typically the stays in a paddock would be less than three days because we we don't want the animals to to re-graze plants that are starting to regrow after a grazing event we don't return to a paddock until the height is is where we our target is for for entering a paddock and uh we'll skip a paddock if we need to um if the forage isn't grown enough to be able to put the livestock in and then management intensive grazing takes in stockpiling and winter feeding and and really at its core focus was on reduction of cost grazing and and for farming in general and also increased production per acre with management intensive grazing we we we do see sometimes that our individual production or per cow or per steer has gone down a little bit but our overall production per acre is has actually gone up so um mr garish wrote a great book by that same name management intensive grazing if you're interested it's out there and it goes through all those things um while we're on that same thought i i hope that these terms here we'll we'll be putting into a a future presentation um i'm probably going to call it stepping up our grazing game and we're going to go a little more in depth into some of these so i'm trying to hold myself back and not put everything into each one of these the next one there mob grazing uh this is something that i've said that i've been doing for years and as i did the research for this presentation i kind of realized that maybe maybe i'm doing it wrong or maybe maybe it's not what i exactly want to be doing every time but mob grazing typically uses high stocking densities per acre so a stocking density of a hundred thousand pounds per acre plus um for those of you that don't know how we calculate that stocking density is is how many pounds of animal is on that acre so if we want to get a hundred thousand pounds per acre of stocking density and we've got ten thousand pounds of cattle in our herd we need to split that acre up ten times to be able to get a hundred thousand pounds per acre of stock density so we one we've had to have enough forage out there to graze and keep those animals on for for a day and it'd be split up ten times but also we've got to split that acre up ten times to get that stocking density um mob grazing incorporates longer rest periods and things really the at the core of mob grazing it's it's thinking about putting all of our livestock in one big group or mob so our growing steers our finished steers our calves our cows our stalkers if we've got other grazing livestock putting them all out there in one big group um tall grass grazing kind of follows along with that uh we would be grazing stuff that's kind of over mature maybe has gone to seed um at brown and the hope of tall grass grazing is when we when we go those ultra high stocking densities that the livestock are trampling the forage that's over mature returning it back to the soil and they're grazing the vegetative parts of of that the sword that we have out there uh the the real issue with tall grass grazing is we're allowing the forage to get over mature and and as we think about grazing we think about it being a solar panel out there um and collecting sunlight and if if we let that forage get over mature then it's no longer collecting the sunlight that it could be here in eastern ohio we only get seven eight months of growing season we don't want to let that solar panel get dirty or shaded i guess is the way to think about it we want it to stay green and growing and vegetative and that may have been the biggest epiphany i had while i was doing the research for this presentation is that at times i'm letting things get too tall that was the way i knew how to do mob grazing was let it get too tall with a lot of forage out there per acre and in doing so i'm hurting myself in the production end because i'm not keeping it vegetative and keeping it growing adaptive grazing quite honestly why i started and did this because i wanted to really know what adaptive grazing was uh over at the western pennsylvania grazing conference alan williams talked a lot about adaptive grazing and i really didn't know the definition so to me as i did some research and there are some really awesome youtube videos there's a whole series out there on adaptive grazing that alan williams did so um it it's core it's kind of rolling management intensive grazing mob grazing ultra high stocking density grazing kind of rolling those all in together and and it's just what it says it's adaptive so at times we're at low stocking densities depending on our our goals at times we're at high stocking densities depending on you know we may have a problem weed we're trying to to mob up and and graze hard or or trample we may have tall grass that we need to be able to put them in a high stocking density to get them to actually eat consume and trample that forage but adaptive grazing is adapting our grazing management to our current situations the seasons how the grass is growing and what our herd needs and it may have rolled in a a little bit of the holistic management we'll talk about in just a minute uh rotational grazing this is one that i think is kind of the slang term for management intensive grazing but to me rotational grazing is uh somewhere that we we've got a set number of paddocks and we rotate through them at a set number of days so really we're rotating by the calendar uh i've set up a lot of these systems designed a lot of these systems the farmer usually goes says something like well i can only move them once a week so we set up a system with five to seven pastures they move them once a week there's really not any thought put into the forage it's all put into the calendar that to me is a rotational grazing system where we're just rotating based on the calendar and in continuous or set stock grazing when we talk about continuous we're talking about an area where the animals are just out there loose there's no real rotation to it they may be their season long they may be their month long really anytime we leave animals in a panic more than let's say 10 days we're at that sort of continuous grazing level because our utilization rates have fallen to a point that um they're the same as if we would have left them there all season albeit if there's a rotation of any kind it's better than continuous and being there all season but uh anytime we've been in a paddock probably more than 10 days we're getting to that continuous uh grazing kind of situation then regenerative agriculture um that's kind of the new term out there um if i had to pick a kind of a face of regenerative agriculture it's a guy by the name of gabe brown in north dakota but the regenerative agriculture folks really take soil health into account uh a lot of them are cropland producers that are integrating livestock into their cropling rotations um as as gabe brown talks about it he's got regenerative agriculture right there on his ranch sign as you go into his place in north dakota and one of the things he said in one of the presentations i listened to was you know we wanted to talk about being sustainable and i didn't want to be sustainable i wanted to be regenerative i wanted our ranch to get better than what it was so that's sort of the thought for regenerative agriculture is is they want to regenerate and it's also partially realizing that our soils are degraded they're degraded from the time we arrived here and we wanted to put them back to as good or better a state than they were when we arrived and then holistic management created by a man named alan savory uh in africa but also has some some interest in the southwest desert areas of this country but holistic management is a whole management system and it can be for wildlife it can be for grazing animals incorporate some of the high stocking density stuff that's where some of the mob grazing stuff comes from adaptive grazing certainly includes some of the holistic management stuff but it was really created for some of the brittle climates uh and and managing those brittle climates and getting them to produce forage again so um there there again there's a really good book alan wrote alan savory wrote about holistic management it's a very very hard read but it's a very good read on what holistic management is and it's kind of managing all the parts of your grazing operation or of your field or farm so uh in the pastures so we're going to talk about pastures and the different terminology we use for pastures so a paddock for goes under many different definitions i think as we talk about grazing but to me a paddock is the the interiorly fenced areas in our larger pasture area so at home we have 14 paddocks then we can infinitely break those paddocks up into smaller areas that we should probably call sales i usually call them breaks but a paddock to me is is a internally fenced area inside our larger pasture area so from that you can take a sale a cell being for me it's one day's grazing or 12 hours worth of grazing i guess it's it's your grazing durations uh time or length so for some of us a cell in a paddock would be the same thing for some of us it's different like i said i use the term break uh especially in a paddock where i've split it up maybe three different times and i've allowed them to walk back to water for those that 24 hour or however many hours that time is usually it's less than three days i may give them breaks within a paddock and allow them to walk back to water as long as it's less than three days from there strip grazing um strip grazing something we use in the fall when we do stockpile grass stockpiled grazing strip grazing typically is giving the animals a small strip and then allowing them to walk back to water and this may be for a month in the winter time that we keep giving them more strips and allowing to walk back to water because we're really not concerned with how much forage they're going to be picking at what they've already walked over because we're not in the growing season bale grazing sort of like strip grazing with bales we have the bale set stock down there at 25 foot centers typically we build temporary electric fence around those bales and then we move the temporary fence to allow the livestock access to the bales so used a lot in the western states we talked about that a couple of presentations ago for here in ohio but it's a good system especially if we get frozen weather creep grazing something we might do with cows and calves we may build an area in the fence so that the cows can or calves can get to the next day's grazing or next week's grazing to allow them to kind of pick a better forage or or have a better meal than what their mothers are eating in the panic that they're in creep grazing can use a creep gate it can use a raised area in the fence or simply the calves can go under the one strand wire to get to the next field to creep graze leader follower grazing sort of along that same line what we do there is we're putting the the animals that are on a higher nutritional plane ahead of the animals that don't need to be so let's think grass finishing steers in the front paddock and cows in the second pasture so the cows follow this the grass finishing steers so the grass finishing steers are only eating the best and the cows are eating what's left over or eating the rest before we move them on so the steers move ahead the cows fill in the field that the steers were in and then flash grazing is something we talk about if we're grazing say like riparian areas that we fenced out so streams creeks ponds places we might only turn the cows in there for an hour or two hours are very short duration so if they go in they graze and we get them out of there before they lounge around and before they have a chance to degrade that area by tramping down stream banks or wading into ponds those are areas that we would do flash grazing we'll talk about forages um i here i just kind of threw in some terms that maybe everybody's not uh really up on and also maybe some things that need a little bit better definition to them so a sward a sward would be all of the forages contained in our pasture or in a paddock um so our grasses legumes forbs weeds everything that's out there that is grazeable is what we consider our sward out there in the pasture uh dry matter we talked about a little bit last week and i don't feel like i left it with a very good definition so dry matter is the uh dry matter equivalent of our pastures uh dry matter typically is around 14 percent moisture that's shelf stable for grains and for haze so we figured dry matter based on that so if a cow eats three percent of their body weight in dry matter a thousand pound cow that's 30 pounds of dry matter per day the thing we have to remember is this time of year our grasses are really wet our forages are really wet they're 90 points so that means that they have to eat a whole lot more pounds of forage to cover that dry matter need so we convert everything to dry matter because we don't know what the moisture content of the forage is we know dry hay is dry matter but we don't know our forages so when we're talking about how much a cow eats we always convert it to dry matter residue or residual there again my challenge to everyone to leave a more residue residue is what we leave behind us so that four inches that we left when we when we move the cows on our livestock on uh in a cornfield the residue is the leftover corn fodder that's come through the combine uh i maintain we should come up with a better term in that residue still sounds like waste to me it doesn't sound like uh what we what we want to leave behind and it takes grass to grow grass and if we leave that residue we'll have grass next time if we take it all we won't have grass when we're ready to come back to it the spring flush something we're going to talk about in the web presentation here coming up uh if you're looking at that percentage total growth by month chart down below it's the green line it's that first real big bump in our forage production we're going to be hitting that here in a couple weeks um when everything seems to be putting on a seed head and we can't get ahead and we can't graze enough grass the cows physically aren't eating enough grass that's the spring flush conversely the summer slump follows that up it's the time of the year when the forages just kind of stop growing uh typically brought on by lack of water it's thought that it it's heat related but it really is more a lack of moisture even though those are our some of our wetter months it's that we have so much heat that our water around here turns to humidity and is in the air and not in the soil and not feeding the plants stockpile we talked a little bit last slide about stockpiled forage would be forages that we've grown for the purpose of grazing later in a time when forages aren't actively growing so that could be it's typically the fall and winter but also could be the summer slump we could be doing tall grass grazing in that summer slump area and then pugging something we talk about this time of year pugging basically is when we've grazed a pasture that was too wet but we had livestock in a past when it was too wet their hoof action has caused the the soil to lose all of its pore space soils always have pore space for both air and water and if the cows especially get to tromping around in wet pastures they do what we call pugging them up and that is that they leave hoof tracks and they they push out all the air and water and pore space and so the plants have nothing left to grow on the microbes are even going to be severely affected because there's no air for them to get in the soil I wanted to talk just a minute about animal units and how they pertain to our grazing system so an animal unit typically is a thousand pound beef cow we talk about an animal unit we're talking about a thousand pound beef cow and so we convert our actual cow weight down to thousand pound beef cow range and we can talk animal units with dairy cows that typically we're factoring it down to a thousand pound cow for the CAFO units and for permitted livestock operations there's whole charts on what is an animal unit and it's all converting those animals to what a thousand pound cow would do that way we're converting two things one what that animal eats and two the manure that that animal produces all to one standard unit of measure so animal unit falls along with what we talk about with dry matter you know it's kind of a conversion ratio for us so then animal unit day is how much forage an animal typically if we're talking about animal unit day we're talking about how much forage that they will consume in that day's time same with animal unit month our soil surveys are typically put in there for production under animal unit months so that's animal units times 30 days to make it months of production so i know in the western states they use a lot of AUMs and AUDs to talk about how much forage is out there if they're renting pasture or if they're figuring out how much they have under a center pivot irrigation system they talk about animal units and animal unit days and the carrying capacity could be the carrying capacity for our entire operation could be carrying capacity for a particular set of paddocks or paddock or one paddock for that matter but a carrying capacity is the standard set unit for for an area so a lot of the grazing leases in the western states are under carrying capacity they've got a set number of livestock and then typically they go back to animal units for for what that carrying capacity is on that particular piece of pasture and then grazer i threw grazer in there as a an animal in the animal unit category but it really isn't grazer is us it's it's the farmer or the producer that is managing their animals in a grazing situation as i said i had to cut some slides so a grazer within another one but i put this in there because every time i spell it out i get the big red line in spell check and i just wanted to put that out there that i'm not misspelling it uh that is actually considered us that's us the grazers and anyone that manages their livestock in in a grazing way can be considered a grazer so uh just a minute here on some what i consider marketing terms now i know if you're reading down through there you're saying well those are management terms and they are uh some for some of us it's it's lifestyle choices or farm style choices but to me i tend to put these in a marketing type category because this is how folks choose to market their products um i i guess i put this in here because i i end up seeing a lot of things on social media and out there in the community where folks are poking fun at one marketing avenue or another and i always call it back it's all marketing we're all in this together uh two percent of the population or less are farmers and uh so we don't have any room to to kind of worry about how someone else chooses to market their product these are marketing avenues they're ways for us to market a product so organic organic is is done by a certifying agency you have to be certified organic to sell organic products now there is a loophole there where you can sell less than so many thousand dollars and call yourself organic but for the most part those those folks are certified they've got a certifying agency that looks into what they do and organic typically are not allowed to use certain products if they're not naturally derived so one of the things we run into is is we can't use uh treated fence posts sometimes with organic things because that's a not a naturally derived product organic too gets into the discussion of pesticides you know they're not allowed to use a lot of the pesticides they do use some uh they the ones that they use are typically naturally derived pesticides they don't use a lot of synthetic fertilizers but they do use compost manure or other things um natural kind of follows along with that organic um type thing the the natural and i'm not sure whether they're natural even had whether they have their own label or not i'm not really up on that but the natural folks uh typically tend to to say that their stuff is pasture raised so pasture raised poultry or or or hogs on pasture um they're considering that they're natural because there are some folks that raise organic products that raise them in a more conventional setting but they they use an organic feed and follow some of the organic practices so the natural folks are kind of differentiating themselves away a little bit by saying that it was naturally raised and then grass-fed and grass-finished kind of is a sticky situation sometimes um as as they started marketing products as grass-fed uh we found that that some producers can say well it was grass-fed it had grass or had forage but it was also fed a grain product one way or another and so the grass finished has then kind of come up from from there uh to denote that the product or the the livestock was produced using only forage uh typically is what the grass finished would would say uh conventional then is is the conventional way of doing things with they're following a conventional kind of uh way of agriculture and and doing things in the conventional way and and and that's not to be derogatory of the conventional folks i i firmly keep myself uh on the fence on on all of these marketing what i consider marketing terms uh because i see merits in you know all of them i think all of them have some good points and and all of them uh work for themselves and and and that's why i consider it marketing because it's it's all in what works for that operation and how they choose to manage their operation how they choose to market their product well that's a wrap for this web presentation i hope i helped you guys have a little more understanding about some grazing terms and some definitions for them uh we'll end this presentation by thanking our sponsors i hope you guys enjoyed what we've put together here um also while i'm here i'll say don't be afraid to go look up some of these grazing terms if you enjoy our web presentations there are really good youtube videos out there about a lot of these topics uh that you can pick up and watch and and some of them there's even whole series of them and i've kind of done that here uh in this the time that we seem to be faced with quite a bit because it's nice to just sometimes turn off the news and pull out a good youtube presentation and boy have i really learned a lot over the last few weeks just doing that whenever i got a chance and i'm really excited about the spring grazing season and what we've got coming up here especially with all the newfound things that i've kind of been watching and reading through uh be looking for our virtual pasture walk next week i believe we're going to start shooting some videos for it tomorrow and try to get it put together and have turned out next thursday so thank you all for watching we'll see you next time
