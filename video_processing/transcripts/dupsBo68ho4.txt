 Remote sensing has become increasingly important for understanding and managing agriculture. This paper reviews existing literature on remote sensing for mapping cropping practices, grouping them into three categories, crop succession, cropping patterns, and cropping techniques. Most studies were exploratory and focused on local scales, relying heavily on ground data and local knowledge. Future research should focus on using multiple sensors, land stratification, and expert knowledge-driven methods. Additionally, the Sentinel Constellation will provide improved monitoring capabilities for food security and better management of agro-environmental issues.
