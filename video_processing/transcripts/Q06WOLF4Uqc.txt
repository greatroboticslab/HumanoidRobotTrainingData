 RAMED TO cet Morton Don't pun deine fiers Let's get started! The current two videos Come on! CK Do it once Jump down! Hi, I'm Mark Hall with the Alabama Cooperative Extension System. With me today is Brad Durham. Brad is our natural resources advisor for Auburn University and he's located here at the Tennessee Valley Research and Extension Center and we're going to be talking about linear irrigation today. Linear irrigation Brad, that don't suit everybody but in some places it's what folks need. Tell us about linear. Linear is just, it goes down and back, down and back, don't circle. It looks like it's the same above ground but tell us about linear irrigation. It's a real good system for any rectangle or square field you have where the center pivots, you know, goes around in circles and some of the edges don't get irrigated, don't get irrigation. We got a hose drag system here and you can get a ditch fed or a hose drag system and they're very, very efficient on a square field and you can cover, you know, quite a bit of acreage. So you can set it up so that you're irrigating every square foot, every row of that field is irrigated if it fits in a linear. That's correct. So that's where it can go down and back which a lot of fields do. What are the disadvantages of it compared to say drip or center pivot? A center pivot, you know, you can pretty much hit the button and go. A linear move system is more labor intensive. We've got to swap hoses every 500 feet we have to swap hoses which, you know, you have to have either a tractor or a truck and drag a hose to the next hydrant and hook it up. You just have to look after it more because you really don't want to pull one of those hydrants out of the ground. Yeah. They're in the ground about four feet and they're very, very hard to dig up and replace. How long will those hoses last? To me it looked like that would be a weakness of the system getting dragged along the ground. Well, the hoses, this is our second set of hoses here and the irrigation system has been in for about 20 years I believe. So they last a good 8 to 10 years I would say on average. For water usage, would the water usage for a linear system be the same per acre as a center pivot? Yes sir, same per acre. Same per acre. But crop wise, talk about crops in just a minute Brad, would it make any difference whether you're growing, we've got corn and soybeans and cotton under this year, but strawberries, high value vegetable crops, would it work just the same on any of them? I would assume it would. I don't have very much of a horticulture background. I would think it would work along the same lines. You know, we've got the drop nozzles that are closer, can get closer to the ground where you don't have a lot more, you know, in the hotter parts of the summer you've got a lot of evaporation from overhead and irrigation. Anything else? I just drug him out of the field and said come here and talk to me about our linear irrigation system and I appreciate you doing that Brad. Any other thoughts on this? Because you seem to be the go to guy and I see you out there working on that thing all the time when it's going, when it's hot weather, irrigation is a job. That's correct. You know, the only other labor intensive part of the machine is the furrow. You know, we have to keep a furrow dug to guide the system. You dig a furrow, you know, we've got GPS auto steel tractors that can dig a precise furrow and run that machine, the irrigation machine, right in a very precise location. You know, I would think if you didn't have RTK's, you know, systems, that might be a little bit of a burden, you know, that could get out of line and it's got these little sensors on the furrow, guide its furrow wheels. You know, if it gets out of line it will cut itself off and cut the water off, all that. So it's really a good system. Say a little bit more about that in line. I'll tell you the truth, I hadn't even thought about that. It's just a linear. Right. It's like a board. It's like a 2x4 going over, but it's got all these wheels. So if one of them gets off, man, that could get twisted around. That's correct. Now, the newer systems, they have some GPS driven systems now. Would that be on every wheel or just one? Those, I believe, are just on one station. You know, ours is in the middle of the field. Our guidance fair is in the middle of the field. Most of them are on the inside right next to the cart, as most people call the cart. That's where the motor and where all the operations are for the machine. Thank you, Brad. I appreciate your sharing your knowledge with us today. Folks, if you'd like to look at our other irrigation videos, here's a website that they're all on there or any other ag or 4-H or home ec kind of videos, how to skin a catfish, all kind of interesting videos right here at this link. Thank you for watching. we'll see here at the next video. We'll see you again next time.ким The Transportation suspension We paid
