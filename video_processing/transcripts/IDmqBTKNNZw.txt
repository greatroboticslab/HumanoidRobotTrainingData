 Music We're here on the outskirts of INAC in rural Damascus and we've just launched a vaccination campaign for PPR, Peste de Petit Viminant. It's a viral disease of sheep and goats, it's quite serious. It's part of a global campaign to eradicate this disease but each requires an international effort but also a national effort and even down to local village level to vaccinate large numbers of animals in a short period of time to make sure that the disease isn't present and isn't spreading. So this campaign is funded in Syria by three projects with FAO, three donors, the Russian project, DFID project and ORCHER. Donors actually with very different perspectives but they all agree on one thing that this disease is a priority and should be tackled. The scale of the campaign is going to be around about 8 million doses to be given out in the next two to three weeks. It's a very concentrated campaign. The vaccine itself is very temperature sensitive so we have to be very careful about the cold chain and we visited the cold store where the vaccine is being held. It's come from Jordan and it's kept at between 2 to 8 degrees centigrade. The campaign is going to reach 180,000 herders, small-scale livestock keepers. It enables them to protect their assets and ultimately will help them achieve zero hunger.пон probiotic Three anime So you can't track whatever Так at step in here and live.
