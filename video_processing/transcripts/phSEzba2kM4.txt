 Ghana's local rice evolution takes viewers through the thriving landscapes of rice farms across the country, highlighting the dynamic innovations and success stories emerging in the industry. The documentary showcases the important roles played by young farmers and processors while emphasizing the significance of local rice production for Ghana's economy. By exploring various stages of the rice value chain and promoting local consumption, this film encourages deeper engagement in the country's agricultural sector. The West African country's fertile land holds the promise of feeding the nation. Today, we dive into the stories of resilience, innovation and national pride shaping the rice industry. We took a trip to Asichari, one of the popular places known for rice production. We caught up with a young farmer whose experience started on a family land in 2010. I'm the person of Nna Azanidu Emmanuel from Asichari. Currently, we are on the KIS project, the Aspore Irrigation Scheme project. But me managing my own started from 2020. So managing my own farm is just five years now. Initially, I wasn't having the intention to become a rice farmer. But let me say, as of now, farming activities are generating a lot of money. So I have decided to keep in that side. Initially, I have the intention to become a bank accountant. Yeah, because I have a degree in accounting. Yeah. I know mainly to become a rice farmer. Imano shared insights on the impact of technology and investments in enhancing livelihoods and creating employment opportunities in his community. When we started, weed control is done manually. Like, you go and hire people yourself. You enter into the right farm and be uprooting the weeds yourself. But as time goes on, they brought some chemicals that are selective herbicides. That when you see the weeds, when you spray, all will go. So it's making the work to become easy. And the plowing too. First, you hire people to come and dig it with normal hole. But now, due to technology, we have machines that they do all the plowing, which make the work to become easier. So now, if you just have the startup capital, the farming will be very easy for you. And the packaging, let me start from the paddy care. Yeah. Here, we dry the paddy and we blow the chaps. Then we weigh them. We weigh them 90 kg. That's one bag. And milling. Then we move to the milling center, where they mill the rice or the de-hask. Okay. The milling side, the packaging is done per the customer requisition. Yeah. But ideally, you package them 5 kg, 10 kg, 25 kg, and 50 kg. That's a maximum, the 50 kg. Normally, it's the farmers who convey the paddy, the wet paddy, to the milling center to process. Then after that, if the farmer said, oh, okay, let me sell it with the husk for a third party to process it, fine. We have people who buy with the paddy, the paddy like that, and they process it the way they like it. What is the price of rice production in Ghana? Rice production in Ghana has evolved. Mostly, as you mentioned previously, rice production had stones and it wasn't well, well, I mean, it wasn't well graded. And also, they have that kind of polishing that the market demanded. However, New Asia Museum is limited currently to our Emily Foods brand. We, beyond production, now farmers farm and get good yields. Now, when the farmers get good nutrition, then their paddy rice is well-filled. And obviously, the nutrition becomes better. Now, we have a state-of-the-art milling facility where we mill, haul with the stone. Then we do color separation or more like color sort of where we sort out the white rice from the lots. Then we grade. We grade on long grain, 75% brookin, 50% brookin. So now, because we are now graduated, we cannot be able to base the different segments of the markets. Some individuals want long grain. So we sell premium, every long grain rice to them. Some also want the brookin, maybe for Omoto and for other processing into Tom Brown and the rest. For them, we sell the brookin to them as well. Then we also have the rice brand, which animal farmers are also using as part of their feed composition and feed formulation. So I believe because of now we are in a global village. So we are picking technologies not only from Ghana, but technologies from across the world as well. And the assets of the art machinery that we have, indeed, can be able to give us that right or can be able to compete with any other imported rice. They also mentioned branding. So every long grain rice is well branded. And it's because we are growing and we decided to now meet the demand of the farmer, and demand of the consumer, which is they looking for well branded packages. And that's where our marketing research have also led us into having the best branding or packaging in the country. The labeling is done at different sites. And you bring the sacks with the labels, then you come and do the packaging here. We have people who do the labeling for what you want them to put on the sack here. So they do the labeling, they bring the sack here, then they package them 5 kgs and the rest, and they sew them up. They sew them. There's an indirect way of employment to the other community members. We have printers, those who do their printing. And we have the factory who do their sack, a transparent one. So while the COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges, it also sparked innovation in the food industry, attracting investors who saw potential for long-term growth. And I'm Alex Ofer, a factory manager for Max Industries Limited. The Max Industries is currently steady of operations, and it is into providing dry and mailing services for farmers. I think on Sea Brain COVID, you realize that during that time, the food and beverage industries became very, very important when everybody was, I think, in Long Island. They were allowed to operate and all that. They realized that it dawned on the CEO that, you know, he will have to put this in place to also help the country in times of these disasters. So it was soon that he gave me inspiration to come out with the food mass industries. Right. I think local rice has come a long way. One were the days that we used to have stones and all these days of regular rice. And now we have a cool seed, a cool method of drilling and, I mean, cool sets. We are using state-of-the-art dryers and then mainly-composite mill. So currently we have a 30-metry ton dryer, which uses hasp as a full egg to grind the rice. Then we have a capacity of about 100 tons of millen rice that processes the dried rice. So we have, from the millen side, we have the pre-cleaner, which cleans the paddy rice. As the name implies, it cleans the paddy rice, frees it from this debris, chaff and all that. Then it passes it onto the stoner, which takes stones, clay pebbles, other solid materials from the rice. Now when you are harvesting rice, you can pick up clay pebbles because you got this on, various stones and other foreign materials, solid foreign materials. Then the stoner takes that out. So from there we have the mola, that is what the hasp of the rice. It takes the hasp of the rice from the kernel and from there spout onto the reddy separator. It separates the dehaxed rice from the kettle. From there passes it onto the polisher. We have the three polishes. We have the primary polisher, the secondary and then the third polisher. Now the primary polisher will first take the first coat of the brand off it. Secondary one will continue polishing to make it a bit whiter. And then it is passed onto the grater. From the grater machine, it sorts the rice into different grays. There are the long grays, the purported grays half broken and then the very fine oak. So now the grater sends the long grays to the water polisher, the dust polisher using mist. The dust polisher using mist like they would have, you know, lipid polish. Polish and blapshy. That's the purpose of the wonder polisher. And from there it sends it to the laser color sucker. It takes multi-color base from the polished grays because you are not interested in those multi-color grays and then from there it is passed onto the weighing and bagging units. So based on the best scale you are being or that career, they set it to the weighing scale, where it is electronic. And from there it is backed and please don't haul it. One significant hurdle needs to be addressed for the industry to achieve sustained growth. And one of the challenges local rice producers face is they don't really have good distribution channels. They are not all over. So when it happens like that, yes, there's a little downtime with respect to processing or receiving raw materials from clients. Nevertheless, we sometimes do receive them however, we are not able to process for them. The reason being that they are not having any demand for your side. You know, this packaging, you have to wait for you to get customers before you package. If you package it and you put it down, maybe you don't get customers to buy it and it's there for a longer time. This maize weaver can enter, which will decrease their quality. So you have to wait for you to get customers before you package. Every business has its own challenges and your business is not alien to that. As a company, we also have our own fair share of issues. Key among the challenges we have faced as a company is the rates of interest on credits or capital or bank loans. We actually in the markets, we are global village, we are competing with the markets where the agricultural sector are getting loans at single digits. The second issue is also with insurance. We have car insurance, home insurance, agricultural insurance, and agricultural insurance. There are some interventions with the agricultural insurance pool, which is no more in existence. We know some few private entities are also doing insurance for agricultural businesses. There is a need for us to have agricultural insurance as a big concern, where we provide insurance to cover a lot of the activities along the value chain. Especially for an agribusiness sector where we provide insurance to cover a lot of the activities along the value chain. Especially for an agribusiness sector where we are fully relying on rain fed or rain for agriculture. agriculture. That is because we don't have enough irrigation supports. Neither we are there in our resources to be able to go in for proper irrigation facilities to help with our production. So we rely on God to do us win. And that is also one of the risk factors. So when we have credits, which is sorted out at very low rates, and we have insurance that will provide that level of or layer of support for farmers or for our economy businesses, then we believe that we are on the road of the risk of the record in the short and long term. By sharing knowledge and expertise, industry players are empowering young people to become innovative entrepreneurs. Yes, so there are opportunities for young individuals. There are 72 that I mentioned. It's interesting to know that we are all young people. I think the highest band of age will be just the early part of 40. And we have a majority of the youth being under 40. So yes, there are opportunities for young individuals who have the capacity to be able to join our growing force. Additionally, individuals who might also want to farm, there's opportunities for them as well. Outgrowers, we have our production hub or production arm called Chigaba. And Chigaba, LTDs and Outgrowers, social enterprises for outgrower companies. Outgrowers farmers who might want to farm. They can be able to reach out to Chigaba and Chigaba can be able to help them out. There are other individuals who are also not green-fingered. I mean, they don't want to do the upgrade, but they want to do a great. We have a product as well for them. They can come on board. We can always see our best. They can be able to benefit from our cultural space. We also have the New Age Economy, which is our newest kid of the block, where we are going to provide trainings for individuals. Some for free and those who might want in-depth analysis or in-depth appreciation can also come on board our Masterclass, where we can be able to help them set up. The thing is, we are young individuals. We've been able to achieve it and we know we can be able to get to a lot of young individuals who are interested in agriculture to also come on board. One of the major giants in the rice value chain, which is Agoke, I think they started, I happened to see their humble beginning. They started and now they are very youth. They've been a client of ours and we went through taking things with them. And then as of now, I can say that they are producing one of the best quality of prepared rice you can have in Ghana. We try our best to make our doors open for students. Agoke's behind the brand of Nana Rice, they mostly deal with some of these young students. They sometimes bring them here, have a lot of whatever is going on here. When they come, adults are always cooking. We take them through the processes, when Ramel will take them through and they see the final powder. They appreciate it. As a company, we combined five years ago with barely 10 staff. Currently, we have 72 individuals who we have employed here and 15% of them being female. Now, these 72 are on new ages or in the group's payroll. Then in terms of supports, we have tagged or directly supported 16,000 farmers, who by extension have also reached out to over 60,000 individuals who have also been engaged along these value chains that we've been undertaking. When it comes to tonnage of rice, we have contributed every year. Year-on-year, we produce this year. We intend to produce 10,000-meter ton of rice on the market. Last year, we did just barely 4,000-meter ton of rice. They still had 10,000 of rice on the market. And going forward, we are planning on doing or exceeding it in our next production years. When it comes to rice, it is a very important crop in Ghana at the moment. It didn't used to be, but consistently, as we urbanize, our eating patterns change. We always want something convenient to eat. So rice has become a convenient food for the Ghanaian population. And we are over 50% urbanized. So if you look at the grains when it comes to our food, maize is number one. We actually need to produce about 6 million metric tons of maize every year, if we can meet our needs. In fact, over 6 million metric tons, because beyond what we eat for Bancong, Cocoa, Eto, and Kenke, and all those things, you also need maize to process all those processed foods by the big manufacturers like Unilever and all those companies. And then you need maize as a main component in animal feed, especially poultry feed. The poultry feed usually would have about 60 to 70% maize making the bulk of the food. So maize is very important. Then comes rice. Rice has gradually grown to be number two when it comes to the grains and cereals that we eat a lot in the country. And we import over 50% of the rice we need. And rice is also labor-intensive, capital-intensive, and land-intensive. For example, if you have a hectare of land, your average yield is 5 tons for rice. Your average yield is 5 tons for rice for a hectare of rice. If I should give you an example, if you have the same hectare of rice, you can get over 20 tons of tomatoes or pepper. And tomatoes and pepper are higher value crops than rice. So if you look at rice, it's become very important. The return on investment is not that great. So it's a lot of waste and it requires a lot of resources. Plant, irrigation, water, and inputs. Your average acre of rice would take about four bags of fertilizer. So it's a lot of work. Now, what we can do to get the best out of rice is to apply industrial ecology principles in the rice value chain. In fact, not just the rice value chain. You can apply industrial ecology principles in every other value chain where one, you try to be as efficient as possible in the production, your water use, your material use, input, land use. Two, you apply the principle of consistency where the inputs that go into that system generates products and by-products which become inputs within the same system or another system for growth. Now, on the rice husk, we can also add rice husk and other organic materials to generate energy, biogas. So if you have rice husk plus poultry manure, cow dung, even plantain stems and all those things, any form of organic material, you can mix them up for biogas generation. So there's a lot of opportunity there. I know a company, a startup in Tamale that uses rice husk to make bots like this. You see on this table and like what we've used for the partitioning behind me for furniture. And if you are producing so much, for example, if you have 3 million tons of paddy rice and about a million of that is going to end up as rice husk, that's a million tons of rice husk that we can use to make MDN walls for furniture, for construction, for ceilings, for all sorts of things that will cut down our import bill on importing some of these things. So rice presents a very great opportunity. Going forward, the state needs to invest in or support farmers to get a lot of irrigation because rice drinks a lot of water. And also support with mechanization, land preparation and harvesting. If you have mechanized harvesting, you actually get better returns. Sometimes harvesting manually, you lose a lot of the paddy. But if you have mechanized harvesting, you reduce your post-harvest losses. Another important element are dryers. If we have dryers in the key rice production areas, rice farmers can actually dry their paddy. Once they finish drying their paddy, they can store and even wait for a better market to sell all. The value chain from farm to market holds the backbone of Ghanese rice production. Technological advancements are boosting efficiency and profitability and offer other business opportunities. So how do we approach that? Once you farm rice, the rice stock grows, what you take out of that is the green, which is the paddy rice. Now the stock, what opportunities are there to use the rice stock? There are a thousand and one opportunities for rice stock. Aside them being composted and to return nutrients back into the soil, you can use them for all sorts of things in the fashion industry. For mats, for a lot of different things in the fashion industry. You can use them in upholstery. You can process them and pack them in upholstery. You can use them in different, different, different forms. So we need to start thinking about how we can harvest those things. In Ghana, usually once the harvester comes to harvest, to cut and get the paddy, we'll usually set fire to the stalks on the farm. That's one of the easiest ways to clear them and prepare land for the next season. That also introduces a lot of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. So one of the things we can do is to strategically also get machines that can help us. We don't even need machines. We have a lot of people who need work. Once we are adding value to the rice stock and creating a product that returns capital value, we can engage a lot of people to do that work. That's one. So we have a lot of people who need to do that work. We have a lot of people who need to do that work. So, if you have a lot of rice paddy, you get about 60, let's say every 60% of actually milled rice. Then you get your rice bran and you get your rice husk. That rice husk is a problem for a lot of rice mills. So you go to a lot of the rice mills, the rice husk is packed and they either set fire to it. And a few of them who have dryers will use, will burn the rice husk to dry the rice paddy. So, there's an opportunity to convert rice husk into MDF boards for furniture like this. Even the rice straw, you can use them for furniture like this. You mill them into fine powder, you add a binding agent, you compress, and it becomes boards like this that you can use for construction, for partitioning, like drywalls and all those things. So, there's an opportunity to use that. Also, the broken rice and the discoloured rice, there's an opportunity to use them for animal feed, for rice wine, and for other nutritional products. Ghani's local rice market is growing, yet misconceptions linger. What will it take for local rice to become the preferred choice on every table? So, if we have to meet our rice needs and be self-sufficient on rice, that is if we don't pivot another commodity to take away the dependence on rice, we need to grow about 2, 3, 4 million metric tons of paddy rice, which we will then mill and get maybe 2, 2.5 million metric tons of actual rice. So, if we don't have to be able to do that, we need to be able to do that. So, rice is very important. And I think largely, we also need to accept the fact that 1 kilogram of broken rice is also the same as 1 kilogram of long grain rice. So that if we educated the populace to agree that 1 kilogram of broken rice, when you eat, is the same nutritional value and is the same store market to go to, 1 kilogram of long grain rice is the same nutritional value, then we, in selling our rice, we can actually mix the broken rice with the long grain rice, so that we can reduce the price per kilogram of rice, so that people can afford rice. What the industry does is that, once we mill rice, we take the grade A, which is the full long grain rice. That's where a lot of rice investors get their returns from. So, they price that higher. And that's what people want. Everybody wants to buy long grain rice. So, you pay more for that long grain. The grade B, sometimes is mixed with the grade A, and then the grade C, it goes to school feeding program or for animal feeding. But once we're able to mix this in a good percentage, we can then not concentrate the final retail cost of the rice on the grade A. We can spread it among these three, so people will still get the volumes at a better price, which will help the industry. So, I think it's something we need to do with the industry. Ghana's agricultural potential is vast. With your support, we can make local rice a symbol of national pride. We can spread it so much. Our side is here. Here we go, boom. We're also acting in a really bad year. cargo bag. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
