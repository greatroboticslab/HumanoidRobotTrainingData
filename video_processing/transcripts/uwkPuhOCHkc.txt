 Music We're JP and Holly Haber and we live just south of South Dakota. And we started with JP's family operation. So you start the story. In 2009, Holly and I got married and started M&H Land and Cattle. And we've been on this place since then I guess. When we got married a little bit before that, JP and his brother had operated together. And JP and I took over the operation. Our main parts of the operation are cow-calf pair. We background cattle and we're working getting ready to feed cattle, bats. And we also do row crops. That's kind of JP's area. We raise corn, soybeans, winter wheat, spring wheat. This year we grew food grade oats for Gerber baby food. We do hay production. We have alfalfa. Cover crops. So this year, well previous years JP had had this idea to bio strip till. Because in our area a lot of agronomists push strip till. And so we, and for the kind of ground that we run, it just doesn't really work that well. Because we have what JP calls prairie potholes and it truly is prairie potholes. And so we didn't feel comfortable putting that dollars and that fertilizer out there not knowing that we would or wouldn't be able to use it. So a few years ago JP said, hey, what do you think about using cover crops to try to do what strip till does? I said, hey, I think it sounds good, but it was really dry for a couple of years when it came time to plant them. So we waited it out and this year it worked out perfect. And so that's what we did. And so hopefully that'll, that'll prove out for us in our rotation. Alright, what we have here is some no-till soil clod here and we have some conventional soil clod here. And we're going to run a demonstration on soil aggregate stability. As we drop these in, we're going to notice some bubbling out of the no-till, but not near as rapidly as the conventional till is starting to fall apart. Really rapidly. And so what this is stimulating is, is a heavy rain scenario that this soil here will erode and kind of run down the furrow. Along with your high dollar seed and fertilizer. Where this is holding together and actually absorbing, taking in that, that moisture. Oh wow, now look at it go. I, I'm surprised that, that I thought I'd be able to pull a chunk out of there in two minutes and break it in half and it would still, it would be dry in the middle. Oh wow. It's pretty much, it's wet all the way through. I mean there's definitely moisture pretty well all the way through and this one's completely gone. This soil can hold, this soil can hold moisture and this soil, that's what we need is, we have to, we have to have the ability to conserve moisture and that's an integral part of that. We say especially in our area, which it's true, especially in our area, but I mean you think about across the nation, California they're putting water restrictions on. I mean it's just a matter of time, it's just a matter of time, it's just a matter of time, it's just across the country, so it really is important no matter where you live. Thanks a lot for joining us with that little experiment. Like we said we're, we're located in East Central South Dakota and right south of Zelle South Dakota. And keep looking for these little guys and these little guys. I'm Holly Haver, this is Haven. And I'm JP. And Harley's taking a nap. Stop in if you're near Zelle. Thanks.
