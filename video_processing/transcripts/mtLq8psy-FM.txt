 Music It's not possible to have good yields of source of water without pollination. Hand pollination. We are now preparing to collect the pollen grain of one flower in the male stage. In the male stage we can see that we are getting some anthers. And these anthers, it is impregnated with the pollen grain. This yellowish color that you can see. We can go to this flower and this flower we can observe that it is in the female stage. So in this female stage I need to transfer the pollen grain from this brush to the flower. For example, I touch it in the recipient. It will be full of pollen grain. And I will transfer this pollen grain to the flower. With one hand I try to open the flower. To expose the female part. The female part of the flower. And after that I put my brush with pollen grain in contact with the female part of the stigma. I do it crossing. And that's all. It is pollinated. This flower will continue developing. But developing only inside. These flowers, they were pollinated maybe some five, some ten days ago. And they continue in this, with this formation. With this appearance. For 60 days. For about two months. And after that, fruits will begin developing. And with the development of the fruit. We can say that we have to protect this fruit. Now we are going to pack this fruit. Just after 60 days of the pollination. The fruits begin to develop. We can see the spine that they appear to develop. To separate one from another. And this is the moment of protecting these fruits. Because now it's fruits. And from this time. It is possible. To have infection. With seed borer. The number one insect in the world. To source up. So from this phase. To when fruit. It be the size. The seed borer can attack. So we have to protect at this phase. Because if you protect. When fruit is large one. It will not work. It will not avoid the problem. So I put the fruit. One or two fruits together. I protect it with. This protection. With this bag. This protection should be kept. At least during two more months. Now it is protected. In this case means that the pest. The seed borer. Has no capacity. Of getting into. This environment. This environment. Because they are protected. With this net. With this. This material. So. I will keep this fruit. Here during. Two more months. At least. And after that. I take out. This protection. And the fruit continues developing. Naturally. The insect. Is not capable anymore. To produce. Any kind of damage. The seeds. Is not. Do not permit. The. Of opposition. Of. The female insect. Now let's talk something about. Pruning. Pruning is. Very important. In. Sersop production. Is a. Practice. That you have. Practice. That you have. Practice. That you have. You have. To have. To have. To have. To have. To have. To have. To have. To adopt. If you want. To get. Good results. If. If you want. To get. Better control. Of diseases. And also. To help. You. To pollinate. To protect. The fruits. With packing. And also. If you. During. The moment. Of spraying. Against. Some. Insect. Some. Diseases. And also. During. The time. Of. The. The. Sersop. Tree. In order. To get. Some. Sunlight. Inside. Every. Day. And also. To permit. The. Circulation. Of. Air. So. Aeration. Should be. Here. To. You. Reduce. The. Prunes. This. Also. This. Other. Branches. In the. Center. Was. Also. Pruned. Because. It. Was. Growing. In. This. I. Need. To. Keep. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. Having. Closing. Again. The. Central. Part. Of. The. Canopy. So. We. Can. Do it. Every. Every. Branch. That. Should. That. Is. It. It. It. It. It. Not. To. Appeal. No. New. Shoots. Again. Because. You. Reducing. Its. Force. It. Strongness. So. This. Is. What. We. Have. To. Do. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To.아� aims. Got. To. To. To To. To. To. Is. And. To. To. To. What. Who. To. To. About. Growing. Inclosing. Again. With. One. Tree. I can make all the practices that this plant will need, like pollination, sprays, packing, harvesting, and so on. So I have to maintain this soursop tree with pruning continuously because this is the way that we can increase yield and we can have fruit of good quality. The first step of harvesting of soursop is the first step of harvesting. Harvesting of soursop. We can see that one fruit of soursop when it is near the moment of harvesting. We have to take a look on the spines and the color of the skin to see if it is ready to be harvested. In this case, for example, we take a look on the skin. You can see some change in the color of the skin. And especially when you do that, when you cut, you take this pine and you force it, you see that it broke easily. It becomes soft at this stage. And also the operation of harvesting should be done with a shear. You have to be a good care. So you have to put your shear near the padangl, near the stalk, near the fruit. Near the fruit and cut like this way. You can cut it this way. And the stalk should remain on the branch. Because it's important because in this zone, in this site, it will continue producing new flowers. It's very important to get in one tree like soursop. To get the site like this one where we can install a flower bud like this one. It means that we have produced or harvested one fruit in this site. At this region, you can see the scar of a fruit that we harvested some months ago. It means if it is well harvested, we can get at this site a lot of new flowers, flowers button. It is very important because it means that during many, many years, we can produce flowers and fruit at this site. And we have to prune, to stimulate new sites like this, new buds like this one in this position, in this position, in this position, in this position like this one, in this position like here. It will help us to increase more and more fruits, flowers and fruit the following years. It will help us in increasing yield and fruit quality. Traditionally, people use both organic matter and also chemical fertilizers. You can use both, okay, but if you say, no, I don't want to apply chemical material, no problem. But you have to apply a lot of organic matter. It's very important to apply because there is good response for soursop tree to what we apply organic matter. And also, you have to consider that when you prune, when you prune one tree of soursop, you are, we estimate that you are putting four to eight tons per acre of leaves and branches. Because after two or three years that the root system goes through this material superficially with very nice results. And also, when you have opportunity, you can use warm compost, biofertilizer and so on. In this case, for example, you can see related to nutrient cycling. Observe, for example, in this soursop tree, it was pruned, all the leaves and branches should be put together under the canopy, under the shade of the canopy. But you should not put fruits. Please, never put fruits, small ones, bigger ones, mature fruits, never put fruits in this situation, on leaves and branches. Never fruits. Why? Because fruits usually develop anthracnosis. Coletotricum is the most important disease that we have in soursop. Labels May so much. Get Sang . Sabre and peoplegrowth in this area of Recall 2-1 Pot го, how to make us every of this plantings. Good morning. Let's see.
