 So I think there's a number of major challenges facing agriculture in the global south. We've got around 500 million small farms in the world and an awful lot depends on the smallholder farmers running those farms. They're really crucial to food security, to providing sufficient quality and quantity of food. They're also right in the forefront of the impacts of climate change and their ability to adapt to that as well as contribute to mitigating it are crucial. Smallholder farmers are really a crucial engine as well for economic development, broad-based economic development is going to depend on agricultural development across much of the global south and I guess finally relating to that there's a really important issue of equity in that it's crucial that economic development is broad-based and includes women and youth who have often been marginalized.
