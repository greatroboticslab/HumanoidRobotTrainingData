 First of all I wanted to say that I am not a PhD I am a PhD candidate so hopefully I'll have that done here within the next year or year and a half so one of the things that I like to talk about is how we can mimic mother nature and I'm having a little bit of difficulty doesn't seem like I can move so I'm gonna let you guys move it let's go to the next slide so we want to mimic mother nature with the application of manure so when I talk to regulators I like to remind them that you know in the early 1800s we had over 60 million buffalo in the United States and and the question I like to often ask is did they stop eating or pooping in the wintertime and of course they didn't and and did we have a water quality problem so as far as we know we had pretty good water quality back then I think there's a few lessons we can learn from the buffalo first you need to apply the manure to a live crop second if we apply low rates and we've already heard many of our speakers talk about that and then really third is proper management of that grass those those buffalo rotational gray so if we go to the next slide and if you look at this grass you can see that in in one case we have a lot of roots in another case so we have very few so I'm reminded several years ago there there was a report that came out that said 45% of the phosphorus is coming off of grazed land and that confused me until I saw this slide in a lot of cases where we have very little top growth we'll get about 50% top growth 50% below ground growth and if you have the grass is overgrazed you're not going to have very many roots there we need to think about how we manage not only the cover crops but all of our plants so the more roots we have you have to remember live roots absorb soluble nitrogen soluble phosphorus next slide so if we look at some concepts on eco farming where we're using no-till and cover crops we hear a lot about no-till how the macro pores move that water through the soil very quickly so I like to think of them as super highways but if we can move that water from a macro pore to a micro pore to a bio pore we can actually use the roots there where we have the cover crops and they can actually absorb a lot of this nitrogen and they can slow down the the water so that we have time for that mineralogy the soil acts as a very good filter of these nutrients so between the mineralogy and live plants we can absorb a lot of soluble nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus next next slide so as we look at what we've done when we do intensive tillage we tend to get these hard pans or a plow pan there here we're going down 20 centimeters or about 8 inches and that gives us less soil volume to work with where we have continuous no-till and of course my goal is to have continuous living cover out there we have this network of biopores that will slow that water down and give it time that we can actually absorb some of that nitrogen and phosphorus so it's it's retention time the longer we can retain that water and in the soil the the better we can absorb some of that nitrogen phosphorus next slide so as we look at some of the data soil organic matter is extremely important on average we've lost about 50 to 60 percent of our soil organic matter from our soils if you look at a sandy soil it may have any worse from one to two and a half store one to two and a half inches of water but it really depends on the amount of soil organic matter so the higher the soil organic matter what this slide shows is that soil organic matter and available water holding capacity per inch inches of water per one foot of soil so a sand will go from one to two and a half a silt loam can go from almost two to four and a silty clay loam can go from 1.4 to three again as you increase that soil organic matter you can really store more water and have more chance to treat it next slide it's also related though to how fast the water is moving so the faster the water is moving it's actually exponential so it goes up two to the six top power so if I double the speed of water I can actually carry 64 times more nutrients so going from one to two mile per hour is 64 times more nutrients that that water can hold some of our streams are actually moving now at 16 to close to 30 mile per hour we see a lot of flashiness there and so that's over a thousand times more nutrients the good thing about the cover crops and live plants is they slow that water down and then they'll drop their load next slide if we look at where nutrients are extracted majority of them are extracted in that top couple of inches so that's where we want to put the manure as much as possible and the deeper we get that manure in the soil if we inject it too deep the closer we are to some of our subsurface drains so again over 40% generally at least on corn 40% of it's going to be taken up within that top six inches so we want to think about root structure and where that manure needs to be applied next next slide so what what cover crops to use there's a there's a number of different ones we have grasses versus brassicas versus legumes the nice thing about the grasses they tie up nitrogen and phosphorus they have very fibrous root systems most of them live live year-round one of the best cover crops we have to tie up manure is oats but the problem with oats are they generally die in the winter brassicas also take up a lot of manure they can take up a very high concentration of nitrogen but again some of those brassicas especially the radish radishes will die when it gets to be about 15 degrees Fahrenheit legumes already make their own nitrogen but they will readily absorb free nitrogen if it's out there so in many cases we may decide to put out a mixture but if we are going to put out a mixture we would really heavily lean towards some of the grasses because they tend to do maybe just a little bit better job for us so again as we look at some of the different types of cover crops next slide we're looking at the grasses some of the ones that that we like to use our cereal rye triticale annual rye grass barley wheat again oats is probably one of the best ones but it depends on what time of the year if you're going into the winter the oats can die off the sorghum both the sorghum and most of the millets are summer annuals so they will die with the first frost on brassicas radishes are commonly used however those radishes get a very big root and they can cause almost like preferential flow they're going to move that nutrients when they decay could move those nutrients lose them very quickly so you have turnips some of the ones that will survive the winter are kale and rape and then the legumes there's a number of different legumes again we probably want those to be a fairly small amount of the mixture because they do make their own nitrogen and they do tend to have tap roots that will move that manure down quite deep next slide you can see some of the nitrogen uptake this was a study we did at Ohio State annual rye grass had anywhere from five to five point three percent nitrogen in the tissue we had four to four and a half fifty pounds of of nitrogen being recycled cereal rye had four to four and a half percent nitrogen the tissue or about 350 to 400 pounds of nitrogen and of course the Dacon radish they had the highest uptake but again they also had the fastest release because they can they will decompose once it gets cold next slide shows probably what we'd like to say is an award-winning radish this is Dave Brandt who raises a lot of radish again the problem with the radishes they take up a tremendous amount of nutrients very efficient but since they don't survive the winter in most cases they can release it so on the next slide we're looking at the amount of fall soil nitrate after manure application this was an average of 24 tests over seven field sites you can see where we had no cover we had 21.3 parts per million nitrogen compared to where we had the oil seed radish we had 6.5 in this in the soil so those radishes take up a lot of nutrients however again they can be an issue going into the winter if well when they die what are the best cover crops next slide for manure uptake again oats and radish are probably the best ones if you're applying in the in the summer early fall but if you're gonna if you want those nutrients to tie over into the winter and through the spring months you can see the ones that we have starred that means that they generally survive the winter cereal rye annual rye grass are have some of the the best root structures and take up a lot of nutrients wheat and barley can also take up nutrients but they're not don't have near the root structure that cereal rye or annual rye grass for the brassicas we have kale and rape you can see the turnips and the radish they generally will die out and then all the the legumes we have winter peas crimson clover red clover sweet clover hairy vetch cow peas is one that is an annual summer annual and that will die out next crop as you can see here this is a slide where we had annual rye grass and we can get tremendous growth these grasses take up a a lot of nor here is where we applied 6 000 gallons of swine manure and we got some tremendous growth just within 45 days so again the grasses have more of a fibrous root system and are very efficient at taking up manure nutrients next next slide cover crops for winter application of manure what do we want in a good cover crop we want a live plant to absorb both nitrogen and phosphorus i prefer to see fibrous root systems versus a taproot not that we can't do some mixtures but you want to make sure that you have some that are going to survive that winter and have some of the fibers more fibrous root systems we want something that will hold up the equipment in wet weather in a lot of cases especially on livestock farms there's the forage possibilities of getting something out of that cover crop it needs to be easy to kill and then we don't want to have too many carryover problems for the next crop either with insects weeds or tying up those nutrients too long so if we let those grasses grow too long in the spring sometimes we can get some aleopathic effects or they'll tie up that nitrogen and won't make it available to the next crop if they get too high of a carbon to nitrogen ratio next crop next slide cover crops again for manure winter manure application these are probably the the five best ones kind of in order cereal rye annual rye grass sometimes with annual rye grass can be a little tough to kill and it can become a weed problem the triticale the barley the wheat if you're looking at mixtures don't want to put out too many of the radish probably no more than a pound per acre at the most oats can be part of that mixture and then obviously we can put a few of the legumes in but we don't want them to make up too much last issue is some things that we might want to be a little bit concerned about is on very short pastures because we don't have the the root growth there we can get a lot of either running off the surface or even through preferential flow we can get cracks in those those pastures it's all about root growth and then where we have alfalfa hay because it has such a long taproot and especially on a mature alfalfa hay field they tend to be very leaky and sometimes those can get into the tile line so you have to be a little bit concerned you have to pick your cover crops in order to avoid some of these issues so i think cover crops can really help us by adding that extra organic matter and tying up some of these soluble nutrients
