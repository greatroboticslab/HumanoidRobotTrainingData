Education
 learning outcomes explains the reasons for plumbing explains about the different type of tools used in agriculture narrates the precautions to be taken in seed selection appreciates the agricultural labor for their skill in transplantation draws the diagrams of agricultural tools how many days are required for getting the crops is growth period for all the crops same we are mainly dependent on agriculture for our food most of our food products are obtained from plants the plants which are grown in large number to get useful food products are known as crops the process of growing crops is called agriculture the growth period for all the crops is not saying some crops like zover and red ground takes a minimum of 180 days or more for harvesting such crops are called long-term crops some crops like green gram black gram takes 100 days for harvesting and such crops are called short-term crops pulses this is also one type of short-term crop the crops that grow in rainy season june to october are termed as karif or rainy season crops example paddy the crops that are grown only in winter season that is october to january or april are generally called ruby or summer season crops wheat maize coriander fenugreek barley etc or rabbi crops these are the various steps in agriculture it starts from preparation of the soil and up to the storage of the crop yield let us know about the agricultural practices preparation of soil to transplantation in detail farmers divide the field into plots then each plot is plowed and harrowed before growing crops proper plowing of the soil is necessary plowing loosen the soil and it helps in easy transportation of air and water water is sorted deeply for a long time as the soil is soft roots penetrate in the deep and can respire well as the air enters easily into the soil soil friendly microorganisms and earthworms can grow well when the soil is soft some four microorganisms insect eggs come out and die due to the sunrise wooden plow used for plowing see here they are plowing in the wet fields plowing with a tractor attached with agricultural tool called putler after plowing and preparing the soil in the wet fields the farmers they are leveling the fields leveling the fields with various agricultural tools a putler attached to a tractor this is a iron plow to be attached with the tractor leveling tool plowing agricultural tool wooden plow and the leveling tool big plow set what are the important activities in the cultivation of paddy or rice in the cultivation of paddy it involves a series of activities in those activities selection and showing of seeds are very important before showing farmers select good quality seeds the healthy seeds gives healthy crop testing the seed quality see how the seeds are appearing for a healthy crop we require quality seeds the best seeds will be full and uniform in size they should be with the same color and no cracks or spotting seeds should be free from weed seed or other rice varieties mixed in by accident seeds should be free from disease and germination capacity should be 80 percent and above seed germination test to do a germination test first take a plate or tray then put 100 seeds half a centimeter deep into the soil in rows cover the seeds with soil add a little water so that the soil is moist keep this tray in a separate place after five to six days count the number of sealings with healthy roots and shoots count the number of sealings is the germination percentage selecting seeds using the flotation technique for each kilogram of seed one liter of water is needed pour the seeds into the water good quality seeds will sink and poor quality seeds will float remove the poor quality seeds wash good quality seeds with clean water three to four times washing in clean water is important seed treatment treat each kilogram of seed you will so with the three grams of carbon azim fungicide in one liter of clean water soak seeds in water mixed with fungicide for 12 hours after 12 hours remove the water and wash the sheets with clean water put treated seeds in a wet jute bag and place them in the shade keep them aside keep the jute bag wet by sprinkling of water regularly seeds usually sprouts in two to three days does all the farmers follow same method in germinating the seeds another method in seed germination farmers soak the certified seeds directly certified seeds are usually very high quality and good germination percentage also distributing pre-germinated seeds in the well prepared seed beds after sowing keep the walkway between the beds full of water four to five days after seeds germinate and maintain two to three centimeter water on top of the beds for five to six days do not let the soil develop cracks if needed splash the water from the walking area and drain on the beds does all the farmers follow the same procedure to prepare seedbed collect the series or different activities done by the farmers in the karif and rabbi season analyze and make a brief report on it preparing the soil preparing the seed bed leave sufficient space between seed beds and ensure the seed beds are free from water storage direct seeding method how the direct seeding method is there see here distributing the treated quality seeds in the seed bed directly the seeds germinate in few days and produce quality seedlings seed bed requires sufficient water and nutrients after the suitable growth the seedlings are uprooted transported and transplanted in the soil when the seedlings show four to five leaves they can readily be transplanted uprooting the seedlings from the nursery plat before uprooting flood seed beds so the soil is underwater to avoid damaging shoots and roots when you uproot ceilings when the plants grow to certain height farmers pick out the ceilings from the plants and make bundles uproot ceilings by holding several between thumb and forefinger at the base of the ceiling and pulling gently sideways how they are removing the ceilings from the nursery plat so they are carefully handling the ceilings and they are bundling the ceilings after uprooting the ceilings these ceilings are transported to the transplanted area transplant the ceilings as early as possible after uprooting when carrying ceilings to the field be extra careful and not to crush or dry out the ceilings ceilings it is best to carry ceilings in a basket transportation of ceilings after transportation of ceilings to the transplanted area farmers starts the transplantation process remember healthy ceilings are a must for better yield paddy plants are shown in proper distances this is called transplanting natalue adam why the ceilings are replanted at proper distances if they are very near to each other they will compete for water nutrients and sunlight the paddy variety shri vari requires much gap between the plants sri means here system of rice intensification transplantation method and crop yield are closely related ask your elders how many plantlets are planted at one place is it one or five to six plants as a group do farmers follow this transplantation method for all type of crops do you know what a paddy planter is this is a paddy planter it is used in the paddy transplantation it is useful for farmers those who cultivate paddy in large areas it is easy to maintain proper distance in showing the seedlings it is time saving and money saving process different types of paddy planter machine conditions are available in the market evaluation explain about different type of tools used in the agriculture narrate about the precautions to be taken in the seed selection how do you appreciate the farmers and agricultural labor for their skill draw any three agricultural tools e content
