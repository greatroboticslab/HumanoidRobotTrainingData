I'm going to put this one right here in the middle. Cover it up. And then I'm going to water. So what I'm also going to do, I'll probably get another bag after just a few of these all the way up to the top. So I'm going to go ahead and just... I underestimated the water here. Coming all the way over here. So once they're still growing, I'll just use the water. That's the water in the canal. And then hopefully it doesn't mess the back. I wonder should I put it across the board. Oh, we're going to see. It's going to be dry. I don't know. It's going to be dry. The box is still broken. Yeah. I think that should start it real or not. But I don't know. We're going to go from here. And see how they grow. All right. So I got the potatoes done. So next thing I'm going to do, probably tomorrow I have some seedlings. I'm going to go ahead and start indoors. So, you know, when the spring kick in. So I still got a little time. But I'm going to go ahead and start them indoors so I can transplant them in six weeks. So thank you guys for watching my garden channel. God bless you. Eat what you grow. And have a growful day. And I'm going to go ahead and grab, 알 while I'm going to have a growicle berry.
