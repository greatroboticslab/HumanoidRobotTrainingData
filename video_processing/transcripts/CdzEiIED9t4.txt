 Have you ever seen those big round bales? Okay, we got some hay so we're gonna play! And wonder just how much hay is really squished in there? I mean compared to like a square bale, it's little. But these big round bales, is it all loose? Is it really tight? Is it super heavy? Well, we're going to rip one apart here and see if it's enough to bury a person in. Yeah, bury a person, you know, kind of like at the beach. Oh, you bury a person in sand. Well, we bought three round bales here. And let's go ahead and rip them apart. See how many it's going to take to make a pile that we can get a person buried in. Right, so let's see if we can push it here. First we thought we're going to have to rip it apart where it's at and haul it. But nope, here we go. Rolling like a snowman. Across the field. Pushing it to nowhere. Middle of nowhere. Pushing, pushing, pushing. We're heading out to middle of the swamp here. Still going. Hay bales, really, really heavy. I don't know how much this thing weighs. Way too much to lift, that's for sure. All right, we're pretty much where we're going to rip this thing apart here. So, let's get these bale twine string things off of here. Snapping them. Rip them to the side. They're packed in there pretty good. And the fun begins. Here we go, ripping them apart. Starting to make a pile. It's going to take a long time to get a pile to bury someone in right there. A lot of that roll left though. Oh yeah, it's getting there. The pile's getting bigger. It's getting there. It's really dusty. Very dusty. A lot of work. This is getting exhausting. That was a pretty lame jump there. Took a lot of hay, one round bale. That's a lot of fun in one round bale. Hey. Looks like one bale is all it needs. One bale and we got a huge pile of hay here. There you go, now you know. Mix nonsense.
