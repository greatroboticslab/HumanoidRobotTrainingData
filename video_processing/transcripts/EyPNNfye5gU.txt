 Hey, Tim Crow here with the Alabama Corrobative Extension. Today we're going to be looking at drip irrigation. We're going to break this into a couple small videos, look at some of the components of the system, how to hook that up from a water hose faucet with a battery timer, and just how that can kind of be modified into different circumstances depending on your type of garden, whether it's a vegetable garden, a raised bed garden, or even container pots. So stay tuned and we will start with components.
