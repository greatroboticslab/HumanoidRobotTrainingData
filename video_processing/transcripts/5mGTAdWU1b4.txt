 Hi, this is Jonathan Roths, Field Agronist of Pioneer. I'm back here today in this same cover crop field that we had earlier and you can see it's still green and growing. Now some folks may say that a cover crop this size is way too big to worry about planting through and there are some challenges that come along with it. But just as a lot of producers that I work with have found out there are ways to get through this and there's actually some benefits down the road as well. More on that in some later videos. Cover crops have a lot of benefits including soil preservation, carbon sequestration, increased organic matter in soils, both nutrient creation and retention, and many more. However, as we try to maximize some of these benefits we can also create management challenges for the crop. This first challenge we meet in the spring is at planting time. This video will highlight how some producers are working to manage through some of these challenges. The first challenge we come to is simply planting through this amount of biomass. As discussed last time, some of this starts in the fall by not planting your cover crop very heavy to make sure that biomass is manageable. About one bushel of small grain is enough. Many producers who have adopted planting into large cover are also using some form of rolling to lay the cover down before or at planting. These rollers not only push the cover down but they also crimp the cover. This helps so that the cover crop will not stand back up as well as starting the process of decomposition and nutrient release by keeping the cover crop in contact with the soil. In this scenario, this crop was sprayed with herbicide just prior to rolling. The next part is to make sure that your planter is set up to not wrap the cover crop while still making a good zone for the seed to be planted into including proper closing of the seed trench. Many options are available for planters that can work in these scenarios, but discussing these options with others who are having success is a great place to start. When planting into cover crops, either make sure the crop is dead and somewhat dry or live and growing. These are the two best ways to manage the cover crop so that your planter does not have issues cutting through the cover creating hairpinning in the furrow. When a cover crop is in the process of dying, it can be hard to cut through. Of course, planting into cover is also no different than any other planting that you must make sure that the soil is dry. Many have found that a live, active, growing cover crop will actually help pull moisture out of the soil, whereas a dead cover will keep soils wet. Once the cover crop is rolled and planted through, you now have a nice mat of biomass that will keep soil moisture in as well as help to compete with weeds. This biomass will break down over time, re-releasing nutrition to the growing crop. Now, interestingly enough, right between these two fields, we're seeing some differences in some cover crops. This is mainly due to both species and planting date, but it brings up the interesting observation of what happens whenever we have different sizes of cover crops. And this all comes back to general agronomy and carbon to nitrogen ratios. As we get larger and larger cover, we have more stem elongation and more of those proteins are put into the head production as well as grain. This means we're going to have a lower nitrogen or a higher carbon to nitrogen ratio. This will be slower to die and decompose over the year. Smaller covers on the other side will have higher carbon to nitrogen and will be quicker to disappear throughout the year. Again, we'll see more about this on later videos. This mat of material is a good thing, but it can also make it difficult to get nitrogen to the growing crop early on as it breaks down because it has a lot of carbon to decompose. Because of this, I like to have a significant amount of nitrogen put down with the planter into the soil below the cover crop to carry the crop to side dress time. Although planting through large cover may not be for everyone, I hope that this has at least highlighted how some are making it work. I hope this video has given you some things to consider if you are thinking about changing your cover cropping practices. As always, talk to those who are already doing this to get some tips and tricks, and when trying different things, start in small stages to see what's best for your operation. Thanks for your time, and I hope you found this video informative and helpful. We'll continue to return to this operation and field to highlight some of the benefits we can see with cover crops throughout this season, so keep an eye out for more videos like this.
