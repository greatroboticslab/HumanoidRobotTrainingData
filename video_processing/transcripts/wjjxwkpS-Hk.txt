 We're going to show you the progression of our favorite tomato variety to grow on an aeroponic tower garden. These are known as Sakura tomatoes and it takes approximately three months for them to reach full maturity but you'll be able to harvest tomatoes for months and months after that. These are absolutely generous yielders and we recommend growing this variety on your aeroponic tower.
