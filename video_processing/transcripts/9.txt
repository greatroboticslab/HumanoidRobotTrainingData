 Music Well it's that time of year. We have a tomato plant that we've started inside. It's growing nicely. We've got it here in a container. Obviously it's been by the window and as we can see it's a little bit leggy. Essentially what that is is we have our plants that we start by seed. They're usually by a window or a light source and that light source isn't quite strong enough. So those plants start reaching for light. They end up getting a stem that's pretty long and that's what we call leggy. Now when we start planting our tomatoes, something that's really cool to help increase their ability to stay more stable during the growing season. So we can actually plant them deeper than what they're actually growing here in this container. So for this plant for example, we could dig a hole here in our garden space. So we've got this. We can actually do what's called trenching where we're physically going to lay this plant on a side and then actually point it so it's facing up. Or we can actually dig deeper down into our garden bed and physically plant it deeper to where that stem is then at the top of the soil surface. The recommendation usually is to take off these two little leaves which are called cotyledons and we want to plant to that depth. We'll backfill a little bit here. And then this is going to be our new little tomato plant that's going to end up taking root and provide us with some lovely tomatoes later on in the growing season.
