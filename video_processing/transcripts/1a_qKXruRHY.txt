Education
 I think that's probably the best way because you otherwise would have to sign out and sign back in. So if you could just in the chat box in some place indicate your name, your full name and your CCA, we'll make sure that you get recorded. Well in our presentation today we want to cover three main topics. The first will be evaluating plant stands followed by weed identification control by Kirk Howitt. He's in the Department of Plant Sciences NDSU and the final speaker will be Blake Vanderborst with Ducks Unlimited. We'll talk about disease and nitrogen management. I think after Kirk's presentation we'll certainly take time for him to answer some questions. He'll have to leave. If I finish in good time I might take a few questions on my section. Please feel free to hold questions to the end as well. We'll take whatever time needs. We do plan to finish in general terms after an hour. So I'm Joel Ransom, Extension Agronomist for Serial Crops. Part of my presentation I want to talk about evaluating plant stands. And as you all know having a good stand in the spring is key to a productive winter wheat crop. And I've got a little graph there that shows the relationship of percent winter survival and yield. So ultimately we want to have a reasonable plant stand so that we can work well. The question is how much do we really need? And what are some factors that are going to affect survival? And I think this is one of the reasons we want to talk about this today is because we did make – we did start our winter wheat crop last fall in pretty poor conditions. But the factors that are going to impact the amount of winter survival are going to be the environment. We have little or no control over that. Temperature at the crown is probably the most definitive of environmental factors that we're going to talk about. The second would be the state of hardening, which is the time of year. We'll talk in a little more detail about that. The variety of sowing. And the size and vigor of the plant in the fall. So these would be the four main factors that are going to be influencing the amount of winter survival that we have. And if we look at the general graph that indicates what temperatures our plants can tolerate cold, you can see this top graph is some data from Kansas State. You see that we start – as the plant is emerging, it is not able to tolerate cold. It's kind of like spring wheat in that state. And as we go through a period of cold, it will harden off. And it gets to the point where it will be able to withstand cold temperatures down to about 10 degrees Fahrenheit, minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. And it will persist in that level of winter hardiness until about February. And at that point, the reserves start to diminish and it becomes more susceptible to cold. And we see that as we move into the marsh where we are now, the ability to withstand cold is significantly reduced. And it's not uncommon to have plant stands that have made it through the winter up to this point actually be lost when you have – and go through a cycle of freezing and thaw. And you can see that there's a pretty wide band of temperatures that can be tolerated. It really depends on the type of plant, the reserves in the plant, the variety of its own, and the kinds of fluctuation of temperatures. So it's pretty hard to predict precisely what kind of – you know, what the plant is going to be able to withstand. Let me just review with you some data from last year. This was a winter-to-winter survival model that we put up in Canada. Just one thing, too. They don't actually get to see the mouse come through there. Okay. So if you want – That's okay. If you want something, just put the arrow and see how the arrow shows up. That's great. And that arrow will move around? Look, these can make a new one. All right. So last year – sorry about that little intervention. It was hopefully a useful one. I was having all kinds of fun with my pointer, and you weren't seeing it. But last year we did have a winter wheat survival model. It was very descriptive in kind of showing how the winter wheat plant tolerates cold. And depending on the variety, you can see that like Falcon and Sipator were able to tolerate just about minus 4 Fahrenheit. And as you get further into the spring, you can see that there were cases where we actually had winter kill as a result of plant being less winter hardy and temperature being too cold for it to survive. We looked briefly at where we're at here. This is some data that John Nowatsky has been recording. And this top graph shows the winter golden valley. And if we look at the soil temperatures under a short stubble, we can see that certainly the temperatures are less. They haven't captured as much snow. But in general, I would say that those temperatures, none of them are below what we would say is a critical level for winter kill. We go to Cass County, the bottom graph, we can see that we have had some temperatures, soil temperatures. I think these are about one inch depth where our crown would likely be down 10 degrees. But again, probably because of the snow cover we've had, that our temperatures, at least in these areas, haven't been excessively low. So we have to be too concerned about winter kill yet. I talked about variety being important. And this is, these are some data I collected in 2003 and 4 that I haven't been able to replicate. It was a perfect year for having some oil. And looking at the soybean residue, you can see that our varieties coming from more southern locations. We have a very high level of mortality. Whereas with a little bit of snow cover under the sea, wheat residue, all of our varieties were able to tolerate winter. And so variety choice is really critical. And I know we've introduced a lot of southern kind of winter weed varieties into our system. And so this might be a year where we see some of those failing because of the late planting and other factors. Where in the last couple of years, we've had really good survival because of the snow cover and other things. As I mentioned, the size of the plant going into the fall can have an impact on the winter hardiness. And here's just an example of, you know, very late planted small plants, very few reserves. It's going to have less ability to tolerate prolonged cold than this plant up here. And you can't actually plant too early and have too big a plant. Generally, we don't have that problem in North Dakota very often because by the time you get in and plant that recommended date, you don't get a plant that's much bigger than kind of what that first one looks like. So I think this is one of the issues we're a little concerned about. We had very late emergence because we planted late. The range didn't come until much later than normal. And so we probably have the plant to just kind of set there and barely got a start. So let's talk about what constitutes a reasonable stand. You want to go out and count several areas. Probably I've mentioned two foot length. Probably five foot would be more realistic. And you want to do it in representative areas of the field. We may have some parts of the field where you have big gaps and you won't count those differently than say other more normal fields. You want to evaluate for vigor. And we have a kind of a general recommendation that we can tolerate plant stands down to as low as five plants per foot. I mean, that's probably on our lower end for winter wheat. If you compare that to spring, you can see that we can tolerate about half the stand that we can with winter wheat or with spring wheat. Here's just some data showing you that bottom graph would be coming from Mandan that you really start to see a yield reduction when the plant stands is below seven or eight. But we probably are able to maintain yield sufficient to make it profitable to keep that stand even when we're in that five plants per square foot range. This is some data that I showed you previously showing you the relationship between yield and plant stand. And here, you know, we had a down as low as 20% survival. This would have been kind of a subjective evaluation that we were getting up to 60 bushels, which would indicate that you'd probably want to hang on to that stand. Some other data, this is put together by Steve Daborak, looking at some of the, you know, range of varieties over a number of years. And you can see that, again, probably about that 30 to 40 percent stand in the spring is going to be a critical level where you want to keep it versus where you want to think about tilling it up and finding something else. I'm going to skip the slide in that slide, but basically just showing you the same relationships as you get into that 55 and above. It's not so problematic. But what it, this might be what your field will look like in the spring if you're evaluating your plant stand. And you can see that in this case, the leaves have all burned off. And, you know, some years we keep green leaves throughout the winter. But just because the leaves have been frosted off doesn't mean the plant is dead. Have a really nice technique for determining quickly whether your plants are dead out there. You can dig them up. Nice to wash the dirt off. Clip back the leaf tips. Put them in a bag. Keep it warm. And usually within 24 hours you can see something emerging. If you don't need them by two days then you can be a little bit blurry. But you can see in this case a nice little grain shoot starting to emerge after, probably after 24 hours. So in summary, I think our optimum for winter wheat would be to have a stand in that 20 to 25 plants per square foot. But stands between 12 and 15 square foot are more than adequate. And stands as low as even five per square foot have yielded well if conditions are conducive to tiller development. And you want to consider how uniform the stand is across the fields. Certainly you can have big patches and it's not uncommon to have big patches where you lose stands and other parts that be normal. And you may have to develop a strategy for how to fill in those patches. It's not a good idea to leave patches just to weeds. Others have planted some spring wheat but you can imagine the challenges of also harvesting two classes of wheat at the same time. So you kind of have to have a strategy in place as to how you might handle those patches. I think the bag test is really useful for people who are a little worried about whether their crop made it or not. And it's as simple as going and getting a few plants, taking the dirt off, soil off the plants, cutting back the tissue and observing any regrowth. This fall, as I mentioned previously, we planted late. The plants got emerging late. And so these small seedlings are very difficult to evaluate. They're going to take some while before they'll start to emerge and show any green. And I think the message here would be we'll probably have to be patient and see how things get going once we have the snowmelt and temperatures. We'll go on a disc up a crop that a week later will show some real green and bigger. And I think the question that might have coming our way is that vernalization takes place in this late planted material. And I think that most folks that I've talked to would say it's very unusual that we didn't get enough in the inhibition and start the germination process in the fall. And maybe even this spring, if that's the case, we won't have enough accumulated cold weather to do vernalization. So I don't think that's going to be as big a concern as whether we actually have an adequate stand in the spring. So with that, I think I'm kind of probably have time for one question. If somebody wants to ask a question, then I'll turn it over to for the topic on weed control and identification. I can't see any hands up there. I think Kirk, I'll turn it over. Thanks, Joel. Good morning, everybody. Just working here. Joel and Blake had asked me to come in and talk a little bit about the weed control, especially the winter annual weed complex. And I had an opportunity to stick a few other things in there as well, especially towards the end. Some of you may have been involved with the caution monitoring and the sample collections that we did over the winter. And I've got some information there relative to glyphosate as well as response of the plant samples to fluoroxypyr. I think, you know, thinking about winter wheat and definitely the winter annual grass complex causes consternations for all kinds of people. And church sheets being a species that we don't see in North Dakota very often. Definitely more of Montana weed. But areas where it is an issue, it definitely is. Occurs in enough populations where it definitely reduces yield. And as you can see, the heads there kind of describe those as an open football shape as opposed to Japanese brome, which we're looking at a little bit. Relatively little pubescence on the leaf tissue, short membranous ligule. And if we compare that with Japanese brome, Japanese brome does have a very short ligule. It has a very dense mass of hairs along the sheath of the leaf as well as hairs on the leaf surface itself on the blade. Still fairly small, so it's not easy. It's not like yellow foxtail where you see those very long scraggly hairs at the base of leaf blade. But it creates a shroud around the plant so you can see plants kind of have a halo to them or a gull. And as you can see in this next slide, that dense mass, very, very heavily pubescent. And the amount of pubescence is related to the temperature regime that it's been exposed to, as well as some of the environmental conditions related to moisture. So if you have very densely pubescent, you can have fairly sparse pubescence, but they tend to be quite long relative to the downy brome surface. And then with the seed head there, you can see it's more of a compact football shape. The florets and the individual seeds do not open up nearly as much as the tree sheet. But downy brome is really the one that causes us all of our problems in North Dakota. It is more difficult to control the herbicides and is able to germinate and emerge in the spring along with Japanese brome and easily produced seed. We talked briefly about fertilization of winter wheat crop. That needs to happen with these plants as well. And even the cooler spring temperatures in the evenings is enough to initiate seed production for these plants. So just because it emerges late in the spring doesn't necessarily mean you're going to avoid seed production. This also has dense sheath hairs, but they're quite a bit shorter. And I think the entire field of the plant has a lot more of a velvety touch. Downy brome tends to be a little bit more prone to purple coloration that's brought on by the cold through the winter. And you can see downy brome in wheat the tint of purple coloration, reddish coloration, and then also one of the seeds with the long lawn that will give the downy brome in fluorescence a much more feathery appearance as you see on the right as opposed to the tight clusters of the ball shaped tumis of the Japanese brome seed florescence. Downy brome, like I said before, is definitely more difficult to control than Japanese brome. And when it establishes in the fall, to wait until the spring can create very difficult control situations. This control tends to be more metal in the fall. The plants are smaller. They haven't initiated as many tillers. And there's just not as much tissue to try to get control with the herbicide. Control options before the winter wheat is in the ground, of course include glyphosate, which provides a very exceptional control. And we do have two products, or prepare, that are registered before wheat. Both of those can provide some suppression. I would not necessarily expect complete full season control, but they will help reduce the infirmacy and competition so that we have smaller plants later on in post-emergence treatment. As far as post-emergence, if you have clear-filled wheat, beyond is definitely a good option. And I've also found Olympus, Polyflex, to be very good options for control of these winter annual probes. Maverick can provide a very good level of control, however, in working with our high soil age, we definitely have issues with carryover. And so there's probably not a lot of Maverick used, except for areas where you know that you're going to be coming back to cereals in the fall of the season. And then Sierra, or Everest, and Rimfire Max, do provide good suppression, and if the plants are small enough, we will provide adequate control of the downy broome. And those strong enough, they should provide excellent control of the Japanese broome. Foxtail barley is another plant that's becoming an issue throughout the state. And then the seedling stage, it is very small, very thin leaves, also has pubescence along the leaf sheath, but the leaf blades are narrower. And at the seedling stage is when you really need to control this, because as a perennial, once it truly establishes, it is difficult to control with anything. And when we get to that stage, for the post-emergence treatments, Olympus has provided the best activity. It can kill some of the plants, but the more there, we're just trying to prevent destruction from the following season. And other products tend to be a little bit weaker on it. PowerFlex, I haven't had enough experience to know whether it controls well or not. Prickly lettuce would be one of the broadleaf winter annuals. It looks like dandelion. If you turn the leaf over, you have the long row of spiny growths off the midrib. Prickly lettuce is a composite species. It is controlled very effectively by many of the growth regulators, but especially for pyrolyptide products such as curtail, curtail lamb, or white match. And then, horseweed, I see my D fell down below as they move from one system to the other. But horseweed is becoming a larger issue in North Dakota because of the resistance that has developed to glyphosate. We have confirmed that in Cass County. There are other areas of Lamoire, Pierce, and McIntosh where samples have come in where we suspect there could be some resistance that haven't been tested yet. Without use of glyphosate, we really rely on controlling young rosettes. Plant growth regulators and ALS inhibitors at those early growth stages tend to be fairly effective. Field pennycress, we get into the mustard side of things, recognized by the penny shaped seed pods that close the seed. It takes off very early in the spring and ALS inhibitors are very effective even once this plant starts to fold. Now, there are a couple of other in the mustard family, tans mustard, flicks meat, and very finely divided leaves. And there are also control at the early rosette stages is important for control so that it does not extend to the stage flowers are being produced. You may still be able to get control with ALS inhibitors, especially with combination of a phenoxy type herbicide. But control definitely starts to get more limited. Comparing this with a perennial, this is false chamomile. False chamomile, once it is established as a perennial, again, very difficult to control. Combinations of ALS products plus phenoxy have done quite well, but a lot of the herbicides used in cereals that are based on contact type products will not be very effective on this wheat. There, we see false chamomile, once it starts to flower, you get that typical daisy flower head on it. The other thing that I wanted to talk about for a little bit was the kochia monitoring. We have several fields that people sent in samples last year. This was initiated because we had two specific sites, one up in Pierce County and one in the corner of Stutzman County, that glyphosate resistance was suspected in 2011. Through greenhouse testing, we did that both of these locations had a very elevated level of resistance, where even a gallon, more than a gallon of PowerMax was not controlling all of the plants. And compared with that with 11 ounces that would control every plant in the susceptible check, definitely indicated that we had a problem. The same seed blot was exposed and we were treated with Clarity and Starian Ultra, trying to identify some of the other control options that might be available for cereals. We were not pleased with the response indicating here definite survival and very vigorous growth after full labeled rates of Clarity, even in corn, or the starting rate, the high use rate, 5.7 fluid ounces, was not killing all of the plants. We had several samples come in from around the state, mostly from the eastern half as you can see on the map here. We did have a few kosha samples coming in from the far western I-95 corridor. And these were seeded into pots in the greenhouse. We had a susceptible check in the upper right-hand corner and a resistant check in the lower left-hand corner. We sprayed these pots with glyphosate in typical response and more than 50% of the populations were controlled easily with that standard rate of PowerMax. The green in the corner there, of course, was the resistant check from Pierce County. But we did have several of the flaps that had different amounts of regrowth, depending on if it was a 1x or essentially a 3x rate. In some of those pots, the control was almost nonexistent. We also sprayed all of the plants with Cloroxapir. And typical response to Cloroxapir would not be complete plant death. These plants that are very injured, however, can start to recover after a couple of weeks and start to produce growth. This is a serious concern for our late season weed management because those plants that remain down to the canopy all season long, once you remove the weed canopy, they can start to produce new shoots and produce several thousand seeds per plant, even after harvest. So on the Kosha side of things, what are some of the other options? We do have very effective use of glyphosate or Cloroxapir still in much of the state. However, we do have Cloroxapir looking as well as it should from essentially every area where we received samples. So in those areas, cereals, of course, will rely on Buctril with either Vermoxamil or any kind of Vermoxamil. Copac product seems to be working quite well yet in other crops where you can use Atrazine that has been very effective. PPO inhibitors, the AIM, is very effective in crop if the plants, again, are less than two inches tall. Sharpen can be an effective pre-plant burndown at moderate use rates. However, we cannot expect very much soil residual from Sharpen for managing Kosha into the season. Essentially, it comes down to making sure that you don't have plants there when your crop is established and trying to manage those emerging plants before they get beyond about three inches in height with this suite of products that we have available. I know there are a lot of areas that are listening, probably no-till or minimum-till, but whole hard steel is still probably the most effective and reliable ocean management tool because of the short soil residual of the seed and the susceptibility of the plants to cultivation. I believe that might be the end of my slide set. So if you have any questions, you might be able to answer some of one's issues or other topics that might be pressing in your mind. I see a couple of ones on there that I recognize. Good morning, everybody. It doesn't look like we have many questions coming in. I will be able to stick around for a little while, so maybe if you type in questions for me as Blake is doing some of his discussion, then before I have to leave I can still maybe answer those. Thanks, Joel and Kurt. I want to thank NDSU and particularly Scott for helping coordinate the webinar and for all the support we've had in the promotion of it. Let's see. Oops, I went back up to one, didn't I? You didn't think I did a very good job. You didn't want to redo this. You didn't want to start over. I think it should be a little bit better. I think it still works. Oh, back up. That would be right in here. Oh, okay, here we go. You can click on the name, the arrow over just one by one. All right, thanks. Let's get started here and try to move rather quickly if I can. And what we're going to talk about a little bit this morning is a little bit on nitrogen management and then some on disease management, some of the research that we've been doing with NDSU and SDSU and ourselves. If we just look at that first slide, you're taking a look at there, the soil test plus the applied in. And this is over trials that the EU conducted in North Central and Northeast South Dakota and then through the central range of North Dakota all the way from Crosby to Jamestown to Allendale, kind of on that kind of a line and probably about 80 to 100 pounds on this side of it. And what you'll see there is you look at the maximum levels were probably coming someplace between 180 and 220 pounds of total available in. If you look at John Lukacs' data from Northeast North Dakota, you'll see that from 2009 to 2011, since John has started working on winter wheat, you'll see probably pretty close to that same amount of nitrogen, maybe slightly higher on the top end. The one thing that was kind of interesting and when we added the 2012 data into the DU sites, we added another five locations. And you'll note that that bottom line has shifted a little bit to the left to a little bit less nitrogen. And the reason for that, we believe, is if you remember the winter was open, we were warm most of the winter, and then March was about 15 degrees. And we think there was probably quite a bit of extra conversion going on in the soils from the organic matter. And so we had actually two sites that responded to N, additional N. We had two sites that showed no response to additional N once we got to that first 60 bushel yield goal plane. And then we had one site where actually every level of N that we added decreased yield further, and that was due to the fact that the additional N caused lodging. So the more N we put on, the more lodging we had, and the lower the yields became with that nitrogen. And we knew that to be the case through farmer experience and past yield experiences. But actually now in the 13 years we've been doing these trials, this is the first year we've been able to document it in trial settings. So that does happen. So if we look at the amount of nitrogen, talking with Ron Gelderman at South Dakota State, SDSU is still at 2 1⁄2 pounds. NDSU is still at 2 1⁄2 pounds per bushel of actual nitrogen. And they're working on new recs. Some data that we've been using in our DU studies from ARS that was conducted for a long period of time with winter wheat at Mandan, North Dakota, and at Sydney, Montana was 2.25 pounds per bushel for 12% of protein. We're pretty comfortable with that. We think at some point in time, hopefully with more data, we'll actually be able to reduce that number further. And I think as some of these new breeding programs and techniques come online now, you'll start to see groups focus on greater efficiency of nitrogen as well in these new varieties. One thing I just wanted to point out, I showed this slide last year, is that we just need to remember, in working with our producers or if you are a producer, is that winter wheat has a higher yield potential than the spring seeded wheats by 20 to 30%. So you need to take that into account when you design your nitrogen programs for the spring or if you've already done it last fall. The other thing to remember in that is I think winter wheat probably can get by with that quarter pound less per bushel than the spring grains can. So you do gain some efficiencies there, but probably not enough to make up the fact that you need to add more into your winter wheat to attain those yields. One thing is we talked about the maximum end needed for maximum yield to be in that 180 to 220, 230 range. Obviously economics play an impact on that and what that final end rate will actually be. And you can see on this slide, I'm going to see if I can make this pointer work. But over on the left side you've got four and six dollar wheat, so you've got two sets of lines. Obviously you've got higher priced wheat, you can afford to put more nitrogen on the crop. The other thing that you've got is if you look on the far right, you've got 50 cent end, which is the blue lines, and the 75 cent, which is the green lines with the six dollar wheat. So the cost of end is going to impact where that line is at. The other issue that you have is the end protein discounts and no protein discounts. Obviously if you're looking at the line where there's no discount on the protein on the top or the blue on the top, we reach our maximum end level at an earlier stage. But if you have discounts, you'll notice then that you actually need more nitrogen to reach your top net profit potential for the winter wheat. So you can take a look at this slide more and as we will post these on our websites at NDSU and DU and study these a little bit. But they're kind of interesting and someday I hope we can develop a table that will allow us to plug in the discounts, plug in the cost of the nitrogen and the price of the wheat and be able to predict more closely the amount of end that we should probably be looking at in a given year. If we look at placement, Steve pulled together some data for me from our last two years of N trials that incorporate timing as well. And you'll note that there's really no difference in yield from the seeding time application will replace the end of the soil surface to the surface applications of 28% with stream bars. And so if you look at it, which would be breaking dormancy and then we've got the combination of seeding plus, which is the urea down below the surface at seeding times along with the early stream bar. And then the last one is the seeding with the late stream bar. You can see there's less than a bushel difference in those over the two year period. And this follows a very similar pattern to the numbers that we generated from 04 to 07 in North and South Dakota in our trial album. And if we look at the proteins, this pattern of the last two years in our N trials follows that same time span in North and South Dakota when we did 04 to 08. But that fall seeding application actually does have a tendency to have a little less protein than the spring application. And it generally runs anywhere from 3 tenths all the way up to 6 tenths less than the spring applications. And I think that the graph basically tells you too that the more N you put on, the later you put it on, the higher the protein levels will be. Just one site this year where we did see response through the full rate of nitrogen rates was at Crosby, North Dakota. And we had application versus spring application and then nitrogen rates as well. But if you look at treatments N2, N3, and N4 on the left, those were urea at seeding time placed in a deep band. And then N5, N6, N7 were stream bars. N2 was a 60 bushel yield goal rate. N3 was 85 and N4 was 110. And N5, N6, N7 were corresponding to. And one thing you'll note was that there was probably a slightly higher yield to the fall application with the urea when you average those three at 91.5 versus the stream bar in at 89.5. Statistically, obviously not different. But we were noticing that pretty consistently this year. And we think that was probably due to the fact that we had the urea placed below ground. We did not have excess moisture obviously following seeding and during the course of this growing season. And where we looked at the UAN, sometimes the rainfall didn't come following the UAN application for anywhere from two to four weeks following the UAN application. So there was some delay in availability of the UAN . And if you look at the proteins on the right-hand side, you'll note that with the inching fertilizer rates within the N234. And then within the N567, you'll see increasing levels of proteins that you would expect. The other thing, again, just showing the protein on the right, the average of 11.6% for the urea in the fall versus the 12.2% for the UAN in the spring. in the spring just pointing out the fact that some spring nitrogen has the ability to increase your protein levels for you. Then looking at at our watery stage nitrogen application in other words applying 10 gallons of 28% with 10 gallons of water for a total of 20 gallons per acre with a flat fan nozzle trying to increase your proteins right after flower but before the kernel leaves that watery stage and hasn't reached the milk stage but if you look at the yields of the let me get the pointer here comparing the watery stage and versus the no watery stage and you can see that the yields were identical in some cases depending on how the applications go some people do worry about the water stage application reducing yields due to the leaf burn we did not have any issue with that last two years if you look at the approach levels on the right side you'll note that for the 60 bushel yield goal when you increase those nitrogen levels for the 85 bushel we increase the amount of protein from 12.1 to 13.1 and you can see that that's similar trend under the no watery stage nitrogen applications or excuse me with no actual application at the watery stage you can see that the increased levels of animals increase the protein but I think the important thing here is if you look at the the yellow shaded area in the bottom the watery stage application gave us 12.8% rotation versus none at 11.7 for the average so we picked almost a full point of protein up this year from that application last year those numbers were at about a half percent we look at some information that Ron Gelderman shared with us in December and we'll thank Ron for these Ron had done some trials with ESN on urea and its influence on winter wheat yields the thing that that I want to point out is you'll notice these are two locations Fort Pier and Wall and you can see there were some tremendous yields at Pier 102 with the fall application of urea and 107 with the spring application of urea the thing that you'll notice though is he added the ESN they were both 102 and with that spring application he lost about five bushels and you'll see that he lost eight bushels with the spring application at wall and my guess is is that this was a hundred percent ESN treated urea that ESN urea to a point where it didn't benefit yield and then you'll notice them in the next slide that you'll see that the protein levels actually increased a little bit and that would probably fit that reasoning then is that ESN held that nitrogen so if you're going to use ESN with your winter wheat application just remember winter wheat needs that nitrogen early you're probably definitely not going to want to put a hundred percent of urea spread out there in the spring of the year on your winter wheat we look at a this this next slide looking at agritain this is some work that john lukac has done up in northeast north dakota he actually had six sites in 2010 and 2011 and I dropped the one site on the application just remember winter wheat needs that nitrogen early you're probably definitely not going to want to put 100% of urea spread out there in the spring of the year on your winter wheat we look at this next slide looking at agritain this is some work that john lukacs has done up in northeast north dakota he actually had six sites in 2010 and 2011 and I dropped the one site on the I was a little uncomfortable with with the gray the urea agritain was had dropped its yield pretty substantially and I think it's one of those outlier type situations but at any rate you can take a look at the yields at the various locations for 10 and 11 and you'll note in several cases there's no difference in yield but in two or three cases there are some some differences in yield and if you look at the averages on the far right you can see the urea was basically 80 bushels the urea plus agritain was 83.8 or about 84 and then the ammonium nitrate just not to have any volatility because it's 100% nitrate had 83.3 so it's kind of a check to the agritain as john says it's not meant to work every year because you hope you're going to get rain for that urea on the surface and it's going to take it in and I agree with john so it's in those circumstances where maybe like in 2012 we applied the urea early we had an early spring we didn't get any rainfall for two to four weeks so you don't expect to see a response I know some of the trials that we did in 2012 we did not see a response to the agritain and again I think it went back to the fact that we were getting subversion of organic matter that we it wasn't an issue I think this is probably the most important thing I'm going to show in my portion of the slides today Joe talked about stands and stage of winter wheat and if you look at the the top left-hand picture you'll notice that the development here is is from below the soil surface all the way up to one leaf stage and this was actually in the fall of 2011 at our minot location at winfield and then if you look at the bottom slide on the right this was actually a little fallow strip a plot area that that hadn't been seated the prior year we seated right through those areas you can see we had two and a half week wheat there versus the stage that we had one of the things that we tell growers is our goal is to have approximately 50 to 70 per square foot when we come to that harvest stage now obviously if we're seeding and we're seeding at rates of 25 to 35 plants per square foot we're going to need to make up some time here so we're going to need to want to encourage some tillery and so we're going to want to probably put some nitrogen on early to enhance that the tillery prospect so if you look at the two pictures in the two corners we got good vigor in the field on the left but we got very poor vigor on the field on the right and what you want to do is just as soon as you can traffic that field once the frost is out you probably did get 15 to 25 pounds of ant on in some form urea or 28 percent or whatever form you can get it on and hopefully get some rain get some rain and help stimulate the tiller just looking I'm going to cover now just a little bit on disease management and mainly it's on fungicide timing applications and on response in 2012 we saw the least response we've seen in the past three to four or possibly five years to fungicide applications as you recall it was dry early so tan spot wasn't a big issue and scab was not a big issue we did have some stripe rust in some locations in eastern Dakota but you can see that in our 2012 variety trials which are scattered across north and south Dakota we had a 3.8 bushel response across all varieties that obviously varied from location to location and variety to variety with about a 5 percent return increase in yield I should say we looked at 2009 it was a 10.2 bushel response and about 15 percent increase in yield 2010 was a 14.2 bushel with about a 20 percent response and 2011 was a 12.9 or 13 bushel with about a 24 percent increase and so we looked at that average across all those years with 12 included it's been about a 10 bushel response with about a 15 percent increase in yield John gave some data I'm not going to go through this slide but I just wanted to show it to you and you can go back to again to the websites and dig into this if you want but this is John's data from northeast north Dakota from 9 10 11 and 12. and from that data these next three or four slides are summarized from that data but if you look at the sites there was 22 experiments that contain the Pissarro application at early flower in the studio with the herbicide and then the Pissarro at the early flower and then the check and you can see that in those years in northeast north Dakota he's getting most of this benefit from the Pissarro application. at the Pissarro application at the early flower in the studio with the herbicide and then the Pissarro at the early flower and then the check and you can see that in those years in northeast north Dakota he's getting most of this benefit from the Pissarro application at the early flower. So in three out of 22 experiments as indicated below he had a five bushel of greater yield increase the tributary herbicide time with the fungicide. So if you look at the next one he broke that further apart and he's indicating that in five out of 14 experiments there was a five bushel of greater yield increase due to the flag leaf fungicide. And then in 12 out of 14 experiments it was due to the early flower fungicide. So for John in that area that is pretty strong evidence that application at that early flower stage is really important. Then he went on to further break out a few other comparisons and indicating that in four out of ten experiments Pissarro treatments yielded five bushels or more than the Pissarro treatments. I think many of you probably remember Marsh McMullen the NDSU pathologist that retired last year was indicating that she felt that the Pissarro paid for the difference in cost between that and the flow cures and the generics. And John's data here is indicating the same. If you look at the next statement in seven out of ten years Pissarro increased yield by five bushels or greater over no fungicide treatment. And in the case of Pissarro it was eight out of ten experiments in that particular series. I think if you look further south, say south of Highway 2 and west of Highway 3, there you'll see those early herbicide treatments or the combination of the herbicide and fungicide pay more than they do in John's area. Because tan spot is a bigger issue as you move into a different climate compared to what John has up in north, east corner of North Dakota. Just in closing, to open it up for questions, we're thinking about conducting a webinar in July or August again to talk about a number of different things but to prepare a proceeding in the fall. Some of the stuff we'd like to probably share there is getting quite a bit of new data with starter trial research with P and potassium chloride and sulfur. So we're going to share some of that. I also want to share some information on some of the no-till rotations that are going on around the country. This is just a slide from the CCSP farm that is jointly led between growers in northeast South Dakota and southeast North Dakota. And what you have there is a blue lines is the yield for corn in a corn-corn rotation where the corn is stripped tilled. The second bar, the rose-colored bar is a wheat wheat, a spring wheat, winter wheat, and then corn following that. And in a strict no-till setting till. And then the third one, the yellow bar is a spring wheat, winter wheat, and then corn. But the winter wheat is stripped tilled in the fall and then the corn is planted into that. And then it's a soybean-corn rotation where the soybean ground is stripped tilled and the corn is planted into that. And you'll just notice the four-year average that did not include 2011 because of hail. But you'll note that the stripping and the soybean strip tilled are both very competitive one another over the long term. And you'll note that the corn-on-corn, even using the strip tilled, cannot compete with those two. And then the other thing you should point out is actually in 2012 and 2008, you'll note that the corn has done a little better in one year. And then the no-till wheat without the strip tilled has actually done the best. And that's when we're in a drier environment and warmer environment in those periods. And I think the one thing we should remember is we've been in quite a period of wet years. And I'm just kind of wondering if we're not transitioning back to a drier climate. And if we do, some of the things and some of the practices that we look at, we may need to go back and evaluate where we were at prior to this wet period. And so those are some of the things we'd like to probably take a look at in the next webinar. Some of the rotation impacts on economics and some of the things dealing with rotations on weed resistance. I'm going to quit with that and we're going to open it up to questions. While we're waiting for some questions, again, I'll just remind you that we'll be posting these to the websites. And if the South Dakota State folks like us to ship it to them and have them posted on their website, we can do that as well. Because a number of the pieces of data that we use in our trial things are from South Dakota. The other thing, what we did also indicate that we were going to give out a little prize. And Joel picked out a number of course and then Scott figured out who the login was and that was Sue Raeslund. And I believe Sue is the writer for the Farm and Ranch Guide at Bismarck. So Sue will be getting to that little gift later on. I see there's a comment there about that there's less than 10% of the winter wheat in our area has emerged. What are the hopes for a decent drought? Joel and I will both respond. Yeah, that really is a point of concern. Because we really don't know what the status of that seed is. I mean, it's quite possible that it imbibed and started the germination process and that process will continue as we get into the spring. And that seed will obviously have burned. So that's not a critical issue. It's just kind of how much vigor and how much stand we're going to likely get from a crop that really just started the process of germination in the fall. So that would be one scenario. I guess we could have a scenario where those seeds set there dry and never did germinate. They'll germinate in the spring. And then, you know, I guess in the worst case scenario, they'll act like a winter wheat crop was planted in the spring. They will not have been fertilized. But my sense would be that in most locations, we've probably had enough moisture to get this germination process started. And that we'll have to keep a close eye on the fields as we come into spring and see if they survive. You know, that's one strike against them being late emergers in small plants in the fall. And hopefully that they'll have the kind of weather that will allow those things to express themselves and get out of the ground before it gets too late in the season to where we have to make some kind of determination for determining the crop and plants on this. But I think generally we would say that it's not a hopeless situation. That often we have success when fields that were planted in the fall really didn't emerge completely in the fall. But we were able to get a start and then develop into the spring. Just a comment. I've been working with winter wheat since 1977. And, you know, it seems like one location every year, either with research or with my actual fields and wildlife farm as well, is that we would have a location someplace where winter wheat either was underneath the soil surface or slightly above the soil surface. But so much of the weather it makes it depends on obviously over winter. But this period we're in right now, if we can get some moisture to rewet that surface, if the crown is still alive anyway, there's still a very good chance that this crop will make it. I think we've only lost one research plot since 1999 due to poor emergence. And we've had quite a few of them that were either below the soil surface or half leaf to leaf stage of growth. Don't be completely discouraged by it. I guess the other thing I'd encourage you to consider is the fact that if you're dry and you take this crop out, what crop are you going to plant? And what crop is that crop going to have any better chance of making it? So I'd encourage you, particularly in those areas where you don't have any subsoil moisture, to give this crop a little bit of time before you get too anxious. I just want to comment. If you're seeing mold on the plants, it's probably dead. So that is generally a pretty good sign that that plant has succuned. What was the next question? Here, what temperature is required? What temperature is required? 32 degrees. Yeah, it's starting to grow. Yeah, Joel says 32 degrees. And I agree with that. As far as vernalization, I'm not worried about vernalization at all. If you've had that seed in the ground, my guess says there's been enough moisture for that seed to swell. And that's all it takes. Then once it gets cold again, then the vernalization process is taken quite care of. I think Chris responded to when you were talking before there. Okay. Yeah, and then that would be the next question, I think. The seed vernalization is bringing home. And as far as how long is the temperature required to be cold again? Joel, I can't remember what the time period is. You know, it's probably about a 30-day period. Yeah. Joel is saying it's about a 30-day period that you need for that cold. One of the things that you can do is if you go to our website or the DU Canada website or Saskatchewan, there's a – Dr. Fowler has winter cereals manual there. And there's a really good section on cold and vernalization. And I would guess that NDSU and SDSU probably have that in their materials as well someplace. And just bear in mind it doesn't have freezing or vernalized. It's higher temperature. Yeah. And Joel pointed out, and that's true, that it doesn't have to be below freezing for the vernalization to occur. It's just temperature at a certain level. And then the question for C. Yeah, you can do a list serve and then Becky actually – Answer that. Aaron answered. Okay. So then Evan just popped it in. Okay. Next question from Evan. Is that when we planted into broken CRP and am most concerned with the volunteer grass, mostly Timothy, what herbicides would you recommend, Joel? I think unless it's one of those winter annuals, generally the normal grass weed control will take out most of the grass. You just want to get good timing on the case where you have to start. Joel's response is, you know, if it's your annual – your winter annuals or your annual grasses, you know, we've got some tools to select from. But if a perennial, which I think Timothy is, and I'm not familiar with control on Timothy, but my guess is you probably don't have much choice in terms of that control. But I'll tell you what, if you want to go to our website and drop me an email, Evan, I'll do some research on that and try to get back to you. Okay. We think we may have missed a question here. I'll get to the ice question here in a couple seconds. I can't remember now. Is that the person you went to? Yeah. You've won about that. Okay. No, that was the first one. Ice. Okay. Ice. Okay. Ice can have a very detrimental effect on winter, particularly as we get closer to breaking dormancy as that plant is needing more oxygen. But if you get a layer of solid ice over top of that plant and it stays there for probably four to seven days, it can actually cause desiccation. And the worst situation with bees, its surface is probably a little dry and you get some melting going on and then you get a solid layer of water around that crown and all the way to the surface of the soil. And that kit becomes probably the most estimating. Yeah. So it's not what you'd call typical winter kill. This would be ice encasement. It's very deadly. There's nothing you can do about it. I mean, it doesn't take long to kill the plant. But it's common except in your low spots typically that you would have your whole field covered with ice. But it's, yeah, it's any time from now until things get too big to be iced up, ice encasement can be a real lethal kind of scenario. One of the things we've experienced is that if the ground is warm underneath the ice layer, that ice can actually granulize, particularly if you've got a snow layer above the ice. And sometimes it will granulize fast enough that there'll still be enough oxygen movement. Or if you've got stubble sticking through that ice, that can also act as a conduit for oxygen as well. And that can help. Well, I think we're going to wrap up. Once we have a quick question. Thank you folks for attending. Looks like we had pretty close to 70 folks on and I think there were some groups in the session. So if you find us an effective way to communicate some timely issues, let us know. And we'd also appreciate feedback on the type of information you'd like to see in these webinars. So thanks again for your participation. Thank you very much.
