 Glass houses are really important for us here in Daylesford. It's a short summer and long winter we have here. So these little dwellings that we've built all around the place. And also various frost protection, such as above here on the north side where we can grow kiwis and citrus. And more citrus down here. Yeah, just it's... Citrus will grow well in Daylesford. Like these lovely Meyer lemons. But there is a little bit of frost protection above. And so this dwarf lemon has just struggled for the first two or three years. And then it's about five or six years old now and it's really starting to pump. Same with this Blood Orange. It's really going gangbusters now. But the first few years we had frost protection across the top there. And it's on a north facing wall. An earth, rammed earth wall. And that creates a nice heat bank. These citrus are doing okay here as well. We've got more grapefruit, lime and mandarins over here and another orange. Again, there's frost protection above them. So it's... they're not fully enclosed these ones, but they are getting enough frost protection. I've just finished this little cloche. The... the galvanized frame I got from the tip. A local glass guy cut some glass panels for us. And the wood came from a friend's mill. Um... Liam and Mick and Pete's mill. They're doing awesome things out there. Sustainable timber millers and... Um... All sorts of different artisans are out there. And they're also growing food. Pigs and chickens and orchards. And... Just awesome. So... Yeah, these were off cuts that I was able to repurpose. Um... Yeah, so... And then there's glass houses over here as well. Again, there's citrus in there. We really want to build our citrus. This one... This is another blood orange that just went in last year. It's doing really well. It's like a little Tardis or an outdoor dunny. This one doesn't have a roof on it, so it gets rain. But it's enough of a protection with all the glass in there. And it really heats up beautifully. Um... And, uh... Yeah, it creates a nice little microclimate. And this one here... We're... We're stretching a goat skin on at the moment. But this one is growing a jam... Japanese Mandarin. And, uh... Woody's got a little pineapple project going on over there. And there's a... Um... We've had some... Uh... Chilis and Capsicons. And then this is a little, uh... Tamarillo that got knocked by the frost. So... It's in here as a nursery. Yeah, so basically... Um... Glass houses. Greenhouses. We build them out of whatever we can. Uh... Old window frames. Um... Things that, uh... We... Yeah, we... Basically... Uh... Salvage. And then reconstruct. And... Uh... Put together again. So... This is, uh... Gardening in a Cold Climate. Extending the Growing Season. So... Um... In the Cold Climate. Uh... In the Cold Climate.
