Howto & Style
 Alfred Castillo here, the Sprinkler Warehouse Pro. I wanted to do a quick little video here on how to use Quick Lock fittings. Quick Lock fittings come in couplers, tees, elbows, plugs and adapters. Right here is a Quick Lock coupling for .94OD. That's 3 Â¼ inch tubing. Let's attach it. Unscrew the nut here to expose the barb. The first thing you'll probably notice is that the nut turns opposite of what you'd expect. Rock the tube back and forth to wiggle it on. Now tighten up the nut. These are removable and reusable. When you get ready to remove it, just reverse the process. Now these are for drip only. Operating pressure is 45 psi max. So that's how you use Quick Lock.
