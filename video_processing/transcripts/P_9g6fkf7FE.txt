 How do we feed 7 billion people? What about 9 billion? How about 14? Is there any way that we could do this sustainably? What would truly sustainable agriculture look like? Imagine that this urban greenhouse is your local supermarket. When you look inside, rather than seeing rows of a single crop, you find a food-producing ecosystem, with fish swimming through channels and mushrooms growing underneath fruit trees. This is Polydome, our vision for how agriculture could be made more productive, socially equitable, and truly sustainable. At Accept Integrated Sustainability, it is our company mission to create the foundations for a sustainable future. Agriculture is one of our key priority areas. Today's agro-industrial food production is focused on single product systems. These monocultures generate far-reaching problems. Their structural need for complex logistical chains siphons money away from food producers and alienates consumers from the source of their food. Monocultures also concentrate and separate material flows that would normally cycle between multiple ecosystem elements. A team of us at Accept came together to develop a smart, polyculture-based solution that would address all of these problems. With support from Dutch partner organizations Innovation Network and SIGN, we set off on a year-long research trajectory. We visited farms, interviewed experts, and developed databases on over 400 agricultural products. With this knowledge, we created a process for designing highly productive greenhouse ecosystems. We co-located crops and animals based on their resource preferences. We layered hydroponic production with soil-based crops. We envisioned internal logistics systems to simplify harvest and processing. And we beneficially coupled material flows between products. Polydome can produce high-value niche products for local sale, rather than growing a single product for low-margin export. This can improve the livelihoods of workers, farmers, and local consumers. Polydome increases food security and access while improving the business case for urban agriculture. We publish the results of our work in a free, open-source research document for anyone to use. We want Polydome to become a reality, and are now developing partnerships to build the first pilot.
