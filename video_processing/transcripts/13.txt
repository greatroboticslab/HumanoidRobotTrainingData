 Hey guys, it's Jenny here. We're out in southern Lone Oak County. I got my buddy Colin Torian with me. Colin, what are you going to teach me today? So today we're out here harvesting rice and I'm going to show you how to operate a combine. Sick. So, by the way, how much do these combines usually cost around the ballpark? We're looking at about a half a million of machine right now. Sick. A lot of trust. A lot of trust. Trust me more than my own family trusts me. I'm fairly positive. But, okay, cool. All right, well, let's go do it. Sounds good. Perfect. It's actually surprisingly nice because there's like air conditioning. Oh, it's so nice. Instead of being like... I mean, it's ridiculously nice. Yeah. So, we've got nearly everything that we need to have done to this machine, even while we're harvesting. Uh-huh. We can do right here from the last seat. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Is it always beeping at you like that? No. All right. So, what we'll do over here is we'll throw this thing in gear. Okay. So, we'll turn on the rotor, which is actually what's going to thrash the rice. Uh-huh. As you can see, the fountain auger is starting to come in. We're starting to put a little bit of rice that's probably in the belly of this machine. Yeah. And then we'll crank up the feeder and the header. Okay. And then you just use your hydrostat. When you go over a levee, you're sitting here and you're adjusting the header the whole time. So, like, you've got a joystick. It's kind of like a big video game with a lot of, like, really real consequences. So, how can you tell when you're, like, I mean, I guess when you're, like, dipping down and coming back up, like, when you need to adjust it or should the header stay fairly? So, what we're looking for is down here behind the header. We're trying to make sure that we're not leaving any rice heads. Uh-huh. And as long as you're clean there, you know that you've got your header where it needs to be. Uh-huh. And as long as you're feeding really smooth and the volume looks good on both sides and the flow is pretty even, you know that you're in good shape and your ground speed is really good. So, what was that just there when we were, like, kind of going up and... That was the first of many levees that we're going to go over. Oh, sick. See, this thing's feeding through right now. Uh-huh. So, here's your technology screen right now. Kind of lets you know what rice you're in. Your yield monitor. It's up around 192, 184 bushel. Your moisture machine, which is really, or your moisture monitor, which is really important. Uh-huh. Because what we do with rice, we have to make sure that it's a certain moisture so that we're not, you know, putting the mill in a bad spot by bringing them too wet a rice or anything like that. So, the technology that, you know, goes into monitoring this grain while we're actually cutting it is really big for us and the people that will receive this rice once we take it to them. Got you. So, I map a lot of this stuff out. So, like, when I come out here and I plant it, you know, drilling rice is a little bit different. But the recording software that you have in your machine, like, you can go back and look at these digital maps and point to an area where you think you might have had a problem. Uh-huh. And be like, hey, you know, we need to go out there and pull some soil samples. We need to try to fix this. Like, there may be, you know, something that we're overlooking here according to the information that this machine is willing to give us. What he's doing is he's waiting on this machine to actually signal to him, you know, how full it is. I have flashers on the outside of this thing. So, when it's three-fourths full, my lights are going to start going off. When I'm full, my lights will constantly be going off. Okay. And he just looks right. And he pulls up beside me and I unload onto him. And he takes it out of the field, loads the truck, and gets going. Okay. You want to drive this sucker? Okie dokie. He's going to say, we're to your spot. You get to make your combine debut. I'm going to let you set it up. Always watch for the grain car guy. I was about to say, am I going to have to unload the end while I'm gone? If you want to. I kind of don't. I'm kind of nervous about that. I'm not going to make sure that. I don't want to watch just money fly across the field as I... It's like mowing a yard. Except if you're eating all the grass. Yeah. Alright, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to back up. And this is your fault with him, man. Is that a break? Yes. You won't have to worry about your brain. I just let it out with that break. So if you ever have an issue, just pull this thing right back to the center. Okay. Because this is stop position. This is a good place to be. Okay. Alright, sure. Your four-wheel drive and everything is already good. Alright, cool. So... What is that noise? That was letting me know that we got out of the seat. You want me to hold that? Yep. You're going to hold that. Okay. I don't know. How are we... Good luck to me. Alright, cool. So, right now, I'm sitting here and I... Hit that lever right there. This one? Yeah. Pull that thing down towards you. Okay. Alright, cool. And I'm going to do this first. Yes. Push it forward. No, no, no. Pick it up and push it forward. There you go. Alright, now start idling up the machine. Halfway? Slowly. Alright, give it a little more juice. Alright, go ahead and push it all the way forward. Oh, there you go. Now your feeder, which will be the... Yeah, the lever next to that. That goes forward? Pick it up and press it forward. Yep. Now all you got to do is cut rice. But do I need to push this thing down? Yes. Like, which one? Right here. This guy. Yeah, yeah. Let's go down. No, no, no. The controls are opposite. So up is down and down is up. It's not doing anything. Oh, it is. There you go. Do I need to go down further? Yes. Yeah, you can see where your level needs to be because of where the other rice is cut. Alright, you're down too far. Pick up a little bit. Okay, go down a little more. Right there. Perfect. Now you're good. Alright, this is an opposite though, right? Okay. That joystick is kind of sensitive. So, like, a little bit goes a long way. Okay. I'm probably going 0.5 miles an hour. No, you hit the one mile an hour mark. Oh, did I? Oh, yeah. You're trailblazing. Am I, like... Okay, yeah. Can you see the edge? Yeah, I can see the edge. Alright. But do I need to get clipped? No, no. You're doing good. You've got a full header right now. Okay. That's what matters when you're cutting rice is making sure you keep your header full. Because, like, it doesn't matter about going in a straight line or anything like that. Oh, really? And making it look pretty. So, it's just making sure that, like, everything across from me is... Yeah, keep your header full. Gotcha. Keep your header full. I think, like, I can turn this around and get a shot of the header if you want me to. It's fun, but it's crazy. It's kind of nerve-wracking? It's kind of nerve-wracking because, like, what's interesting right now, I'm afraid to go faster than this pretty much at this point. Right, yeah. No, I mean, so... And that's what the crazy thing is about, like, operating farm equipment. A mile an hour is a big deal. Yeah. You go from cutting from one mile an hour to two mile an hour, you know, it feels like you're setting a new ground speed record. And then you get up to three mile an hour, and even over that, you're just kind of like, wow, everything's happening so fast, what's going on? And you look over there, and you're like, I'm going three miles an hour. Yeah. So, you can see your digital speedometer over there. You know what's crazy is I'm very scared to look to the right of me. Okay, all right. So, no. So, you are going to unload. I'm going to make you unload. But, all right, stop right here. Wait, wait. Just pull back on the joystick. Uh-huh. Yep. And put it in that. Yes. Yes. Okay. Now, go ahead and pick your header up. So, we'll do this number here. And then hit this button right there. This guy? Yeah, just tap it. Yes, just hit it. All right, now watch right here. Does this guy know that I'm the one that's doing this right now? Yeah, see the auger coming out. He's going to be like, wait, that shit's doing this. I just want to go ahead and say I'm so sorry. Well, he probably, yeah, he probably thinks there's a problem. But it's all good. There's no problem. We're just full of rice, man. I'm so sorry, dude. It's me. So, do I do it? Okay. Now, now you're going to hit the yellow button. Okay. Yep. And then I need to go forward while I'm doing this. Or no? I mean. No. Do I? If you want to level up, you know. I'm afraid to level up. Yeah, okay. Because as I was going to say, right now you're a really solid level one. No, no, no. Like if you were to keep cutting rice, you know, you do this on the go. Yeah. Okay. Go backwards a little bit because you're going to spread that out. All right, stop. Am I going forward right now? You just want to level that off. All right, so start creeping backwards again. Can I stop here? Yep. So, you just want to pile it up and kind of keep it high center. That way it's not all over the cart. Now I go back? No. Wait until it piles up a little bit. Because you've got to think. You've got a lot of room on those edges, too. Yeah. All right, come back a little bit. Oh, looks like you're almost out. All right, so go ahead and hit your yellow button again. This guy? Yes. All right. You're full. And now I've got to bring it back in? This guy? Yeah. Now you hit that button and it turns and comes back in. Thank you. Appreciate your patience. Thanks, Gary. You're the man. But I don't need to get this guy down. Yes. So I do the opposite. Yep. Do the opposite. So press up to bring it down. It's like flight controls. Yeah, no one trusts me to fly a plane, so. So a little more. Right there. There you go. So what are you looking at to know where you were at the top of the straw? That's what you just said. I just do it as I'm moving. Yeah. Just smooth operator syndrome, I guess. Yeah. There's nothing there. You see how the rise kind of sticks up right there? Yeah, I have no idea what happened there. Okay. Now you're actually straddling a levee. Okay. So this is like some, like you're almost a level two here. I mean, you're getting after it now. You're cutting, you're harvesting rice. You're on top of a levee, man. And you're not just on top of a levee. You're straddling this thing. You're going down here handling business. This does not sound like a good idea, but I trust you. Oh, man, you're doing it. You're doing great. Yeah. And then you'll be done with that levee. Okay. You've successfully cut your first rice levee. Woo-hoo. I should probably not take my hand off the joystick? Yeah. Stick? I don't know. Well, I just drove a combine. Didn't wreck anything, right? Mastered the art of driving a combine. Did I lose us any money whatsoever? No, we're good. Then I call that a success. Awesome, Wilcon. Thank you so much for having me out. If you want to hear more about rice harvest, check out our website, ARFB.com. Sweet. See y'all.
