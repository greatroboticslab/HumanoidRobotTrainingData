 The migration phenomenon is quite a huge here in Kenya. There are many people moving from the rural areas to the urban areas and a lot of these people are young. And why are they moving? They are looking for better employment and education opportunities. But we forget that as more people move from the rural areas, we are putting more pressure in the urban areas. So that's why we see that there's a lot of informal settlements that are coming up. But also we have a rather large informal economy, meaning that there are not going to access the decent jobs. So they access more precarious jobs. And that's why we're saying that through this project, we are trying to address the adverse drivers of migration through local value chain development. That means how can we provide better and more improved employment opportunities and entrepreneurship opportunities in the rural areas through agribusiness. Kambu is a hotbed for migration because first of all, the proximity to Narubi, that is a capital city where people perceive that there are many job opportunities. But then we also have to encourage them to stay within the rural areas because Kenya needs farmers at the end of the day. The farmers that we have are quite aging and we need a future bunch that can be able to carry on the a quiet engine and we need a future bunch that can be able to carry on the agriculture to feed this nation. The youth believe that MB farming is not for them. This is what they have seen their parents doing from time immemorial and they want to do something different. Agriculture has been linked to poverty and business for the people who are not going to school. But then you'd see that our youth are quite educated and they want what they call the decent jobs because to them farming is not a job. So they are going to the capital to look for employment. So what we are doing in this project is we are trying to help the youth play their role in the angry business so that we can create opportunities for them. First of all is to train them to empower them to see that in Anglican also there is that business. They can still make a lot of money through the angry business. They don't have to go to towns to look for jobs that are not there in the first place. What we have seen is that agriculture was considered not cool or fashionable. That is what the mindset has always been. But we are seeing a new crop of youth who are taking up agriculture. Those who have known what the secret is. Many of them who are graduates who have gone to schools, gotten their degrees and have seen the benefits that have come out of it. And not only agriculture but we are talking about agribusiness. Bringing in the business perspective into agriculture. These are the mothers. These are my seeds. First of all I am going to breed them. It is four months old now. Okay. We are doing well. Okay. Okay. And then if I have a hundred plus others then I start marketing them. One of the beneficiaries we support is Ruth. A unique young lady who studied for a job in the hotel industry. But following three years in the industry she decided to resign from her job and get into agribusiness. She is currently undertaking a poultry project which she got support from the FAO and the county government. And this is a lady who is quite ambitious. She sees herself as the next millionaire. Having a whole range of chicken. And being able to supply the major hotels and supermarkets in Kenya. So for me that is a story that has stood out. A young person who could easily have worked in a white collar job but has opted. Or her choice of work or business is in the agriculture sector. There's no need of going to other countries. We have seen some youth going to even to Dubai, catch out, look for jobs. Then they come back frustrated. At the end they are like oh I wish I stayed in my country. This is our home. God loves Kenya. We can do it. The market is with us. Wake up and go for it. Whatever is in your mind you perceive it. And later on you receive it. Rural to urban migration is very common. Especially with the youth. That is because of lack of employment. But right now I have come to learn that agriculture has the potential to create many jobs. Because currently in Africa we still have an opportunity to come up with agribusinesses which can sustain our economy and improve our livelihood. As a county we have been trying to make agribusinesses cool so that we can attract more youth. And one of the things that we are doing is to introduce technology. And when we bring technologies within the sector like the mechanisation part, like the value addition, then they are now interested and they can be able to come in. And again now we are also trying to change the mindset that they don't have to be farmers. They could be transporters, they can get into the value addition, they can be the marketers, they can be the input suppliers. Now we see a change of perception and we see now the youth, the young people are, they are really proud to be farmers. Especially now that they realise in Kiambu County there are so many opportunities for us being close to Nairobi. There is a lot of market and there are other opportunities that are coming in. Now the youth are more outgoing. They are now going back to the farm to make the money. The goal, the purpose, you know, that's why you find me having these kids, feeding them like my babies. You know, you must love whatever you are doing. Once you change the mindset and you know, you love whatever you are doing, you achieve a lot. You know, you are going to be the best. Having visited our youth over the past few days, I would say we have a changed lot. A few years back, even when we were starting this project in itself, many of them were quite sceptical. But having gone through the trainings, having been supported to have linkages with the market and even to access finance, we are seeing them open up their eyes and their minds to the opportunities that are out there. But one thing that we have really seen stand out for us is that many of these youth are people who've gone to school, who could easily have gone to look for a white collar job. And many who have wanted to migrate to the urban areas and also internationally, to look for some of these employment and education opportunities. But many of them have chosen to stay back home in the rural economy and see how they can build their agribusinesses. And the key message that I pass out to youth when we are out there is that it does not only have to be production. There are very many opportunities that are in the agriculture sector and in agribusiness. Because the future is theirs, we are the future leaders, we are the zero hunger generation. And of course, we have our population gradually increasing over the next few years, with the food demands also growing. Therefore, it is important that youth are brought on board and engaged in the sector to be able to produce for future generations. There are very many issues that have been implemented today, through some years now and brought premature time. To join us at irishology's
