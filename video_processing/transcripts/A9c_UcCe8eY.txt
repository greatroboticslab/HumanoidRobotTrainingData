 Welcome to our organic farming video on guava cultivation. This fruit is widely grown and valued for its nutritional value. In Sweet Flavor, this video will give you an in-depth understanding of how these guavas are grown with great care and precision, ensuring that each fruit is of the highest quality. We begin our journey in the guava. And guava orchards in Changhua County, Taiwan, mark the beginning of guava cultivation. The cultivation of pearl guavas begins with selecting healthy guava sprouts. These sprouts are carefully planted to ensure they are completely attached to the soil, which is critical for their initial growth and development. When the guava plants are about a month old, you can move them into the farm. In the field, each sprout is planted with precision, maintaining a recommended distance of 1 to 1.5 mem between each tree. This spacing allows each tree to grow and receive nutrients without competing with neighbouring trees. Once seed planted, the guava trees are provided with a drip irrigation system, which is crucial for their growth. Drip irrigation is a highly efficient method that delivers water directly to the roots of trees, conserving water and providing necessary hydration. Water for the irrigation system is sourced from nearby pumps, and before it is used, it undergoes filtration to remove any impurities. This ensures that the water is clean as... and free of contaminants that could potentially harm the plants. If needed, nutrients are also added to the water to support the healthy growth of the trees, ensuring that they receive everything they need to thrive, as the guava trees grow regularly. And trimming trees, especially when they reach four months of age, is crucial for promoting healthy growth and focusing nutrients on fruit development. Removing excess branches improves air circulation, reduces disease risk, and promotes healthy growth. Regularly trimming grass around trees prevents competition for nutrients and maintains the plantation, clean and free of pests. One of the most important stages in guava cultivation is the preparation for fringing when the trees are ready to bear fruit. Before wrapping the guavas, farmers cut the tops of the branches to direct the tree's nutrients toward the fruit. This practice is crucial for producing large and sweet guavas, a hallmark of high-quality pearl guavas. It's worth noting that only one fruit is allowed to grow per branch, a selective process commonly used in Japan to produce higher-quality fruit. The guavas are then wrapped in nylon bags that serve several purposes. The bags create a controlled environment for guavas, protecting them from birds, insects, rain and sun exposure. This results in a more consistent and high-quality product. The waiting king period for the fruit to ripen is about 1.5 months, depending on the season. During the summer, when rainfall is abundant, guavas are particularly susceptible to perishing if not properly cared for. So the wrapping of the fruit becomes even more important during this period. Additionally, while waiting for the guavas to ripen, the branches are pruned periodically to maintain the tree's health and promote better fruit and production. Pruning is an important part of the maintenance routine because it helps manage the tree's growth and ensures that nutrients are focused on the developing fruits. As the fruits approach their harvesting stage, the sweetness of the guavas is checked to determine if they are ready to be picked. Farmers use specific techniques to ensure that only the sweetest and most mature fruits are harvested. This careful selection process is critical because it ensures that the guavas reach taste and texture. Once the guavas reach the desired level of sweetness, it is time for the much-anticipated harvest. The harvesting process is carried out with great care to avoid damaging the fruits. Farmers harvest guavas using scissors and place them in trays to avoid bruising. After harvesting, remove the stems and thoroughly wash the fruits in clean water. This step is important to ensure the fruit is clean and free of any residue that has accumulated during the production process. Guavas are then neatly arranged in trays before being wrapped in a layer of shock-absorbing foam. Guavas are carefully packaged and transported to distribution centres before being sold to consumers. This marks the end of the fruit's journey from farm to market. The traditional techniques used by street vendors highlight the unique way guavas are prepared and presented in Taiwan. Whether you're a food enthusiast or simply curious about street food from around the world, this guava-cutting skill demonstration is sure to capture and inspire you. Don't miss this fascinating glimpse into Taiwan's vibrant street food scene. Thank you for watching the video about organic guava cultivation technology.
