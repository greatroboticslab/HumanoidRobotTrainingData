 What do you think is the most essential ingredient for plant survival? Think about it. Yes, it's water. Water is essential. Without water plants wouldn't be able to bloom, protect fruits or grow seeds. They even need to absorb nutrients and minerals through their roots. Do you know that 90% of plants body is made of water? Yes, and water helps seeds sprout, dissolve nutrients to move them around and it even protects the crop from extreme temperatures. And how do we ensure plants get all this water? Through irrigation. Now you may ask what is irrigation? Simply put, irrigation is a process of watering crops. Just watering crops? Then why do we need such a fancy name like irrigation for just watering crops? Well, it's not just watering crops. It's about watering them at the right time and in the right amount to help them grow and stay productive. Naturally, the next question is what determines this right time and right amount? Yes, what determines? The right time and the right amount depends on few important factors like the type of crop. Different plants need different amounts of water. For example, paddy needs way more water than wheat. Soil type or the type of soil matters a lot. Sandy soil for instance, dries out quickly and needs more frequent watering, while clayey soils hold water for longer. Then season. Hot summer days means plants lose more water due to evaporation and transpiration. So they need extra care. On the other hand, during monsoon, nature does most of the watering for us. So the need of irrigation is much less during monsoon. So watering crops at the right time in the right amount based on factors like type of crop, soil and season is what we call irrigation. And without proper irrigation, plant can wilt. Let's be honest, none of us want our fields and plants to look like this. The next big question is where does irrigation water come from? Or in other words, what are the sources of water for irrigation? Irrigation water can come from a variety of sources. It can be extracted from groundwater, which is drawn from wells, tube wells or water spring. Or it can come from surface water like rivers, lakes and canals. There are also some pretty innovative sources such as non-conventional sources, which includes rainwater harvested or treated drainage water, which is reused for watering crops. Now, how exactly is water extracted from these different sources and diverted to the farmland? Well, farmers usually rely on two main methods, the traditional method and the modern technique. Back in the day, irrigation involves some pretty basic yet clever techniques. These methods were simple, often relying on human or animal effort. Let's take a quick look at some of them. The first and probably the most common one is a pulley system. You might have seen this in action before. It is where water is lifted using a pulley. And now exactly what is a pulley? A pulley is a mechanical device, as you can see here, which is designed to reduce the effort needed to pull something heavy, like a bucket of water from a well as you see here. It's a very smart technique, right? Yes, it is. Next up, we have a rotating chain pump system. This system uses a rotating chain to bring water to the surface. As you can imagine, or as you see in this diagram, the chain rotates and as it does, it scoops up water, perhaps from a well or even a river and bring it to the top where it's needed. From there, it is diverted to the farmland. And how is this rotated? Usually this is again rotated by using a human effort or maybe an animal effort is being used in rotating these chains. Then there is liver system. Think of it as like a long liver used to scoop water. It works just like a seesaw, balancing the weight of the water on one side and the effort, either again by human or animal on the other. It is very simple and effective technique. And finally, we have furrow irrigation, which you might have seen many times, where water flows through these trenches dug in the field. These trenches guide the water directly to the crops, making sure they stay hydrated. While these traditional methods were cheap and easy to set up, they weren't the most efficient at saving water or covering large areas. But hey, they got the job done for centuries. You got to admire the simple clever methods. They laid the foundation for modern irrigation system we use today. Fast forward to today, an irrigation has gone high tech. Modern system focuses on saving water while still getting the job done. Let's explore two of the methods here. The first is a sprinkler irrigation or a sprinkler system. In this method, pipes with nozzles spray water like rain over a large area. It works well with uneven surfaces, ensuring that every corner gets just the right amount of water. Now, where does the water come from? For the sprinkler system, water is pumped from river, well or other sources using a motorized pump. Next up is drip irrigation. And in this method, water is directly delivered to the root drop by drop. There is no wastage here. It's super precise. This method is a lifesaver in water-scurse areas, as it ensures that every drop counts. Just like with the sprinkler irrigation, the water is pumped from a river or a well using a motorized pump. So, in modern irrigation techniques, human or animal effort has been replaced by machines like motorized pump. These advancements not only save time and energy, but makes irrigation far more efficient and sustainable. So, let's quickly summarize. So, what is irrigation? It's just watering crops at the right time and in the right amount. Simple right? Factors like type of crop, soil and season decide how much water is needed. And what are the sources of water for irrigation? Irrigation water comes from groundwater like wells, spring, tube wells, etc. Surface water like rivers, lakes and canals. And then you have some non-conventional sources like rain water or even treated drainage water. Now, to distribute this water, farmers use traditional and modern methods. Traditional methods rely on human or animal effort. And the first one is the most common type that is a pulley system, which lifts water using a pulley to reduce effort. The second method is a chain pump method where rotating chain scoop water to the surface. And the third one is the liver system, works like a sea sort of scoop water. Fourth traditional method is furrow irrigation where trenches guide water to the crops. Traditional methods are cheap and simple, but they are not so efficient. Now, the modern methods are machine driven and saves lot of water. First one being sprinkler irrigation where pipes spray water like rain, perfect for uneven land. Then you have drip irrigation which delivers water drop by drop to the plant roots, ideal for water-scurse areas. Both the modern methods use motorized pump, replacing human or animal effort. With these techniques, farming is faster, smarter and way more sustainable.
