 Hey, I'm Jill Wachs, 4-H agent of Barber County here with Gardner Young, one of our 4-Hers. We're on Gardner's Family Farm. Tell me Gardner, how many acres do y'all have here? 10,000 acres. 10,000 and what all do you grow here? Corn, cotton, soybeans, peanuts, and wheat. That is amazing. Well, we're going to be talking mostly about cotton today, so come on with us to go on our cotton adventure. We drove about 10 minutes on bumpy dirt roads through acres and acres of corn that was planted earlier this spring. Gardner explained that Indians used to live in this area and after plowing, he can find pieces of broken pottery in the fields. Here, the farmers are changing out the seed to try a different variety. Farmers sometimes experiment with different seeds to see which type grows better. The hoppers are the yellow plastic bins that hold the seed. While they are empty, the farmers check the seed brushes, which clean off debris from cotton seed right before they are dropped into the soil. utilize point of the stems here in different fields.

This is Gardner's favorite piece of equipment, the cotton picker. It won't be used until the fall when the cotton is ready to be picked. These yellow triangles cover up barbed spindles that rotate quickly to pick the cotton. The black tubes blow it upward into the basket. When the basket gets full, the cotton is dumped into the back module builder, which presses it into a round shape. The cotton has been bailed and wrapped. The farmer decides when and where to drop the module. A round cotton module can weigh 6,000 pounds. That's three tons or as much as an elephant. The modules will be taken to a local gin to be separated into seed, lint, and trash. It will then be taken to a warehouse and sold. The wood is a large farm. We asked Gardner what is his favorite part of living on such a large farm, and he said that he likes having plenty of space to goof off with his buddies.
