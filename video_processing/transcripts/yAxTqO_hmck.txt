. so so Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. way of course it will be it will be situated and implemented via a ground fault GFI D so I don't get electro macuted you know an RCD residual current device whatever they called but at the moment we're going to use it manually when it's made just got a weld up the components and make sure everything fits I wonder if I could just use a bit of threaded bar stainless steel threaded bar well we'll see we'll come to this project another time but this is one that's on the list so I'm just going over all the steel that was delivered the other day and that obviously involves the new welding table the angle iron for the treads upstairs and some stainless steel for a badass mash tun mixing paddle and the heavens have opened oh my goodness well it's a good job we've got this massive tent that nobody's enjoying friggin lockdown so as soon as it's freezing cold and wet outside the rain has stopped now though I've got the little bit of threaded bar that we spoke about this morning we're about to cut it on that little pencil line with the grinding disk and I'm gonna set about trying to make a mixing paddle for the mash tun hopefully this will work I think we're gonna need some more bar than what's showing I don't know we'll see we'll see we don't know until we brew but what I do know is that I can't find any m 14 threaded rod to weld on to the end so we're gonna have to kind of do a little bit of bodging and get the original stick here cut it off around there weld it onto the new piece so we can screw it in and out of the mixer and then with any luck we'll be able to just spray some lacquer or some liquid galv on there just so this doesn't come into contact with any cleaning fluids but it shouldn't be a problem because we'll have just a little top section there like that that's gonna be going straight into this bit so there shouldn't be too much galvanized carbon steel on the whole shebang meaning less risk of rust and thing so I'm gonna set up the grinder and just spray some lacquer or some liquid galv on there just so this doesn't come into contact with any cleaning fluids but it shouldn't be a problem because we'll have just a little top section there like that that's gonna be going straight into this bit so there shouldn't be too much galvanized carbon steel on the whole shebang meaning less risk of rust and thing so I'm gonna set up the grinder and chop this bar off and then we'll cut down this thin rod and see if we can bend it into the correct shape so I've got this and then we'll cut down this thin rod and see if we can bend it into the correct shape so I've got this one of the the right shapes so I've managed to clamp the stainless into the vice let's bring the original over so we've obviously increased the size because without saying doesn't it go big or go home and we managed to put a bit of a bend on it relatively equal but not perfect in fact it might end up being too big and then we've nipped these two corners down here and we've got this one of the and made them one I am worried that we're not gonna have enough steel but we shall see and then now I have to try and reorientate the base section the steel and put some of these uh helical flutes into it I don't think this is going to work out as symmetrical and as nice as I'd actually want it to but fingers crossed we get a bit closer I'm telling you I'm telling you boys and girls that looks a lot better than it did 10 minutes ago so I think that will do for a mixing paddle I've got the shaft on vertical the tines whilst they aren't bent perfectly are pretty damn close to what we had here previously a lot of fettling has gone into that heck of a lot but you know what that's about as close as you can get with something like that and there was a point when I was putting it together that I thought this is going to end up in the fuck it bucket but thankfully we pulled through so now all I have to do I've chopped this section off the uh the connector for the mixer we've just got to stick this up on the top there weld that on get some of this galv off as well so it doesn't bother me I'm going to put a bevel on there so we'll get a nice tight weld onto it um and then go around and fill it until it comes flush with the rest of the parent metal just to give it plenty of strength so we'll be back when that's done so you should be able to see now both of these tips have been sharpened like pencil so when we weld these two pieces together we can get right down into the root of the steel right into the heart if you think of it as a tree and that means we'll be making sure that it's as strong a joint as possible I have to figure out now a way of squaring it up I think what I'm going to do is stick it in the corner of a piece of angle iron and of course that will mean that it's going to be sat level all the way across I'll show you what I mean I think I've got a little bit over here that should be short enough here we are look so provided there's no swarf in the corners there does seem to be a little bit it should sit level so I'll just clear this swarf out and I'll show you what I mean so here's the set up angle iron clamped both sides which means that this bar now will run parallel to the angle iron provided of course we're making the assumption that the angle iron is straight and then over here we've got the same thing but with the tiny little bolt section just hidden away in there look and what we're looking for now this is tricky because the diameter of these two are different so I'm having to kind of bodge this up a little bit and I am winging it to provide the right kind of distance here off the base of the steel in order for this this is too hard job in order for this to line up with the centre of that piece of steel there maybe if I zoom in just a touch more you'll be able to see what we're aiming for so there's the gap and we do want a little gap in between so we're going to bridge that with a bit of steel and then we're going to fill the rest of this up with filler rod until it's flush with the parent metal and hopefully we get a straight fitting now I'm not going to know straight off the bat I'm just going to wing it as close as I can get it put a little bit of filler in there then go over to the machine itself screw it in give it a few tweaks pull the triggeroo and see how we get on I think that's as good as it's going to get so I'm going to go and fill this and hopefully it comes out exactly how we want it to complete there we have it I'm trying to prop up the the camera so we can get some shots here I don't have a tripod that's the finished article I haven't hit it with a grinder or anything yet or even cleaned it up so I hope you can see it's probably not the best angle to be fair but I'm limited in what I can do in terms of propping the phone up somewhere so here we go screw this bad boy onto the mixer oh dear me I'm going to smack myself in the face with it then not if it's all that right that is attached that will go into the mash tun and that is mixing well if that don't do the trick I don't know what will there we go let me take the camera I've actually got it oh Jesus I've got it in the in the vice of all things but what do you reckon folks mixing paddle a la Haribro 69 you can probably buy one of these in stainless steel for 40 quid from bloody eBay I know I didn't look surely it's not going to be a metre long like this one is in fact it's longer than a metre but that didn't cost me a lot in steel probably about Â£12 in steel for the stock and then a little bit of welding and let's face it with an argon tank like that well we can afford to do a little bit of spot welding here and there but I think that's fantastic that concludes today's project well several projects actually we've finished we've finished the stairs off we've got this done and that was a project I didn't think I was going to get to today now before I go I did want to say a couple of things to mainly to Mr Andrew Lynch who's been watching waiting for me to review his wonderful beers which he was kind enough to send to me so we've got the well that's the cider there this is the Holcomb Stomp oatmeal porter and what's this here the Elvis juice dude I'm going to get stuck into these over Christmas a couple of people know but not many I've been doing a bit of a crash diet I'm 100 well I was 105 kilograms knocking on the door of 17 stone and quite frankly I thought it was about time I shifted a little bit of that so I've been doing this diet and it's worked I've dropped quite a few kilograms in about three weeks but it is Christmas time isn't it and I actually want to put some videos up of me reviewing my beers letting you know what I think of the 12 beers of Christmas and then also I want to get stuck into those beers from Mr Lynch as well he did send me another one but I shared it with Sam I don't think we got any of that on video but we both thoroughly enjoyed it mate so look out for some beer reviews of mine and of Andy's and have a look at yeah the website because we're going to do a deal we're going to do a deal we're going to do a deal boys and girls for Christmas New Year New Year deal so on that so on that note I'll leave you with a view of the Borca mash tun mixer and we'll sign out for now we will be back with plenty of videos over the coming period but I am finishing work alright I lied you know as well as I do I'm going to get bored one day off and I'll be in here doing a project corner we'll see cheers folks I'll see you oh shit I've dropped it I'll see you on the next one
