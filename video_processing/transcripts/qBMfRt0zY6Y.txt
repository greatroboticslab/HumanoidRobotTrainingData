 We've talked about that before, but for people who've never heard those other podcasts, they've determined that the Amazon rainforest is at least partially man-made. They've determined that because of the preponderance of trees that serve human needs. Things like Brazil nut trees, which are providing food for human beings, are in massive dominance in relation to trees that aren't useful to human beings. And it's clear that this is the result of a long-term human project to make this jungle serve human needs. And these food plants show that human beings have been nurturing, have been massaging this natural wonder and turning it into something that really serves human needs. And there's the other thing that you've discussed in depth, the terra preta, this man-made, incredibly rich nutrient-dense soil that they can grow incredible agriculture off of that we really to this day don't know how they create it.
