Nonprofits & Activism
 So good afternoon. Today, Victor will present as a Brownback seminar, or we will change the name soon into Tupperware seminars or something like that. So welcome and thanks for being here. Victor has a Bachelor of Law and a Master's degree in Marketing and Communications with Postgraduate Studies in Local Economic Development. I think it was part of how do we diversify certain profiles in CEMED and in the program. And in that sense, we're looking for experience in public-private partnerships, agricultural marketing, agribusiness and sustainable development. Victor has lived in Asia, Europe and America, where he worked for the FAO, dealing with farming market linkages, as well as agricultural market services. In Mexico, Victor was with the Inter-American Development Bank prior to joining CEMED. Here in CEMED, he has worked on public-private partnerships within the SIP program. He's component leader for Massagro Productor and has been working in different projects in the sustainable intensification strategy on farmer market linkages. And we'll present for us today farmer market linkages in the context of sustainable intensification systems. Before we start, thanks, Victor, for doing the effort, taking the time, like everybody else who's presenting the brown bags, to put your work out there to be looked at. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Hi. Is this working? Yes. So thank you, Bram, for your presentation. Thanks, everyone, for taking the time to be here. I wanted to give you a little bit of an overview of what we have been doing in terms of farmer market linkages and how does this fit into existing efforts and program of sustainable intensification strategy. So the presentation is going to start framing a little bit the scope of the activities we are doing and then we will see some examples in actual projects. So we like to define ourselves as providing input in this sense by providing strategic interventions through the value networks of maize, wheat and associated crops. It's perhaps interesting to highlight here associated crops because it's part of CEMIT's mission to work with crops different from maize and wheat, but especially it's important in terms of markets, aiming at strengthening commercial relationships based on sustainability, innovation and competitiveness. So what we have been doing was reviewing in which sense we could provide some added value to what already was going on on the market and how we could kind of round the activities that CEMIT was already doing and what we were already doing in projects dealing with sustainable intensification being Massagro, the federal project, one of the main efforts. Here you can see one of the infographies, one of the graphics that we are doing in which we kind of map the value chain. It's interesting to mention also that we refer here value networks. We want to refer that there are several readings on value chain and value networks. What is the difference? So we don't think they are those are incompatible terms. We think those need to be combined. So in for instance in the finance the use of value networks have been used for years where they when they refer to the single actors in a given activity considering the different role they may have. So kind of the same thing has been adopted by the University of Chapingo. We have been working with Roberto Rendon of CSTAM by understanding how can we do this. I see this as a reading as value chain could be kind of a 2D projection of what is going on and a value networks can be kind of a 3D projection or kind of isolating a specific player and understand which are the different roles that this player plays being a client, being a supplier, being a complementor, being a competitor. So we have been mapping the mason width value chains with this perspective also. This is an example of commercial network mapping exercises that we did with Roberto Rendon in Oaxaca, in Chiapas, in four states in 2016. We plan to keep working on next year's in this effort. What we do is to understand how do players relate to each other in a specific geographical context. We kind of take a picture of what is going on from a commercial point of view. We take the picture again after an intervention and understand whether new links have been produced. So that there are some factors that we cannot understand by reading a simple value chain, but by having this kind of associations and relationships mapped we get a better understanding and we actually want our collaborators providing support to farmers to also adopt this commercial networking mapping methodology. So why did we start doing this kind of work? It was mostly because of the demand of the farmers. So Massagor as you know started operating in 2011. Soon after that, kind of a couple of years afterwards, we realized that we needed to develop or to put together a component that would help farmers to push correctly their product. So we were kind of helping them to increase their productivity, to increase their production, but some of them were not linked to markets or were linked occasionally to markets or not understanding market dynamics appropriately. And we understood that by helping them to understand that, we could help them a lot. So we systematized the lessons learned. Like globally, there was some work of CEMIT already in different projects and regions in farmer market linkages or in agricultural marketing or value chain reading and we incorporated that into the operation of mass agro. And of course, we went through extensive literature review to see what was what what had been developed and how could we contribute to that. This is an example of an infography of an early product that we developed saying what is the kind of route that a farmer should take by feeling that is not competing with his peer farmers or the peer farmers. They can organize themselves. They can do joint efforts together. These are some examples of materials that we have been reading. So as Bram was mentioning, I was working at the marketing team at FAO and we recovered part of that work. Andrew Scheffer, Ed Seidler, David Caham, who were kind of who have been writing of this topic for years. These are some examples of projects of the Inter-American Development Bank and of course the socioeconomics program of CEMIT has developed also some quite interesting documents that we have been utilizing. These are some other examples. This is one of the last actually one of the last products with Andre Duvaux and Jason Donovan working on an identification of experiences in the CGR but also outside of the CGR and understanding how the so-called VCD value chain for development could be better increase. So starting from all this literature we intend to bring it back to what is going on. So we developed several guidelines, practical guidelines for farmers, for operators to incorporate value chain development concepts in the projects. So for us to start or to work on a specific region we need different elements to combine. So we need innovative farmers, we need an enabling environment and we need willing buyers. So the farmers and innovative when they adopt sustainable intensification, sustainable agriculture, when they kind of do this transition from traditional methods to innovation which is what we are helping them to do with production. So we need to do with projects such as Massagro. Then we provide capacity development in agricultural marketing strategies and we understand that promoting farmer organization is also key for these innovative farmers to succeed. Then we need an enabling environment. So for that to happen we need public policies that support the whole process and we work with public policies at a multi-level. So not only at federal or national level but also at the regional level. Another important factor is kind of identifying and highlighting the existing synergies amongst the different projects that might be concurring in the same region. And that is something that has been challenging but we have been working through the different projects that are for instance taking place in Mexico. And then the fact of institutional networks strengthening and linkages. That means that we link with already in place efforts in terms of trading, marketing, farming organizations and we provide support to those existing structures. Then we need willing buyers. Then we need willing buyers. So we stimulate new business models. We will see what we understand for new business models in a minute. So we look for buyers that are interested in the triple dimension of sustainability. Meaning environmentally, social and economic sustainability of course. So what do we understand by new business models? Are those who include the stimulation of new services or goods associated with sustainable intensification interventions? For instance the development of appropriate mechanization services or the development of manufacturers of post-harvest tools. As well as generating extra added value to existing processes and players. So this is a drawing that you have seen thousand times maybe. So it's the model of the infrastructure of the innovation hub. So this is a model along with we have been working for some years now. So the research platform is where researchers do hypothesis and we bring the market related hypothesis also to this exercise. So by using and validating varieties demanded by the industry into the research plots. And also promoting market oriented crop rotation. Which also meets or combines or adds to agronomic crop rotation. Then we go to the modules or to farmers that adopt those technologies. And we focus on income efficiency and contract farming as a couple of areas of work with these farmers. Those farmers kind of serve as a model for others to adopt the technologies. And then we have the impact areas where we promote farmer organizations and a better value chain integration. So what are the expected results in farmer market linkages interventions? These are some of them maybe. Strengthen overall competitiveness in mason wheat production systems from farm to the final product. So understanding where C-meat can add meaningful value to producers but also to other players in the value chain. Farmers abilities recognize, develop and enhance. And also training is part of the core business of C-meat to say. So we kind of tune up to specific training of markets. Business models based on the triple dimension of sustainability promoted. Tools and methodologies to strengthen inclusive market approach developed and spread. And dialogue foster among all value network actors. It's important to mention that several players from the private sector but also from the public sector. Have seen value in C-meat being a neutral facilitator of processes. And this is something that we have been doing with the inter-institutional working groups and some other spaces for common discussion. So when we decide on when we are invited to provide input to a specific project or a specific need, we start with the diagnosis. So we understand what's going on, why we are required, what is the problem that we try to tackle, right? So we do of course literature review specific for that region to understand what have been experiences that we can learn from. Then we do a collection of primary information through sourcing methods such as value chain mapping and market research. And do further understanding of market needs by understanding who would be the buyer or who would be the pull force in that intervention that we want to promote. Then we design a customized intervention based on the existing model and what the project might require. And we do start with the implementation of the project and a constant evaluation or feedback loop. So this is an iterative process where we incorporate information and communication technologies or meal indicators, monitoring, evaluation, accountability, and learning indications and learning and sustainability indicators. So this is an iterative process that we bring into the formula. Then we scale out. Then we scale out. And actually it's not the idea that CEMIT does the whole process, especially not the last step of scaling out. The idea is that we prove methodology or that we prove an intervention to be worthy. Then the industry and the different players in the industry would have to play their role in validating that further and making it growth. So this is an important area as I was mentioning at the beginning is providing appropriate training. So we developed several courses on market related courses or training. Not all of them have been implemented yet. Some of them aren't on their second year. Some others are still to be developed. As you can see this is a wide program. So the areas would be contract farming, management of rural business, farmer organizations, and inclusive business models. And we have several trainings with different addresses each of them, each of those that we are pushing in our agenda. And there is also the importance to provide sufficient and useful materials for training or for the dissemination of information or the view that we have. So one of the things that we think is missing in a lot of cases in Mexico is contract agriculture. And we have developed an explainer video explaining why it's a good idea maybe to organize and to understand what are the benefits of contract agriculture being whoever it is who provides that contracting. Lastly, for this session, for this start of the presentation, I wanted to explain that we are developing farmer market linkage specific indicators to strengthen the indicator matrix of the projects that we are working on. So in the area of productivity, we are studying as results indicators yield, profit, available grain to trade, and adoption of contract farming as some significant indicators. And we are discussing also with donors what are impact indicators that are useful for them, such as yield evolution, profit evolution, or market effective participation index, which is actually a recent indicator that we are developing these days. So now how do we go from all of this theory or from this ideas to practice or to implementation? These are the ongoing projects in which there is a component of farmer market linkages. All of them are in Mexico at the moment. Of course, part of our lab for proving practices was the Masagro, the federal project. Then we got Masagro Guanajuato where we could do some more in-depth specific research. For instance, in the case of alternative crops for Guanajuato. And then we got several projects with main industry players such as Kellogg's Nestlé or Grupo Bimbo, which have started quite recently within the last 12 months. And we have also a project in its second year now in the peninsula Yucatán with Fundación Haciendas del Mundo Maya. We will see a few examples of work going on these projects. So what kind of activities? How do we phrase our interventions in those projects? Here there are some of them. The idea is to provide value in doing value mapping exercises that are relevant at the hub level, at the region level. And we also feel that are in a good position to link the work that is being carried out in terms of agronomy, in terms of technology development, and in terms of markets. So these are some of the areas. I don't want to read them in detail, but you can see them here. These are instead some typical typologies where we have been working for the last couple of years. So animal feed sector, next animalization industry, agro-industries, or the retail-led interventions or niche markets. In each of these areas, there are different goals depending on who is the tractor or who is promoting the intervention. And we are working with different products. So for instance, the animal feed sector white maize is not required, but triticale or barley are incorporated as interesting associated crops. In the next animalization industry, of course, is focused on white maize. Niche markets deals with land-raised maize. So we have a kind of a variety of areas to intervene. And as part of our exercise to review what was going on in terms of methodology, we identified that link methodology, which was jointly developed by the SEAT in Colombia and IFPRI, was a methodology that could be useful for grains, and that had not been useful to grains. So we brought some people from SEAT to help us incorporate that. And this methodology, what does is kind of assessing inclusive and sustainable business models. And it's a methodology that starts or that has four main tools. One is the value chain map, which means, okay, I understand where I am working, who are the actors, what roles are they playing. Then I design or I understand what is the business model with the business model canvas tool, which is a classic tool, in which we understand how the different actors being the producer, being the aggregator, or being the end user, how do they see themselves, what kind of business do they think they have or they play in the chain. Then we do the new business model principle, which is a tool to evaluate how inclusive our trading relationship is and what can be modified in there. And then we go to the fourth tool, which is the prototype cycle, or actually implementing those modifications into the business model of the organization that we think can help out. And that is also guided by the same participants. Then it's a feedback loop. Then it's a feedback loop. We keep working on this prototypal cycle until we understand that business relationship between two players is actually optimized. What is interesting is to highlight that we have been quickly transitioning from the reading of the, let's say, theory materials to the implementation of those in field. So in four of the seven projects that I mentioned before, in 2016 and 2017, we have been training, let's say, project partners to implement LINK in the regions. So we have some examples here. In Masagro, we got like six cases of partners that have been using LINK. In Masagro Guanajuato as well, in the Kellogg's project as well, and in the Milpa-Yucatan project as well. So as you can see, some of this work is done with native or land-braced maids. Some other is done with more typical or hybrid products, certified products, et cetera. So we have different scenarios and different market typologies that we have been mapping. And this is the numbers one, two, three, four refer to those numbers and the stage to which we have reached to date in those collaborations. Here we have some pictures from the field from our partners, from these organizations in Mexico that are conducting this value chain mapping and following exercises. This is exercise one, value chain mapping, this is exercise two where you do the business model canvas. And it's interesting to see that they have been quite happy and finding useful this methodology. This is actually inputs that have been sent to us during the last months from these associated organizations. So here we can see the value chain map of the north of Tlaxcala. And we can see here kind of the how accurate data we can have with these exercises. So these are specific commercial data gathering from Tlaxcala where we have the different buyers that have been identified. What is the buying price that they pay for the product? What is the kind of payment method that they utilize? What is the demand, the estimated total demand that the buyer can have? And some quality requirements. So as you can understand, this is very useful information for farmers to know and for farm advisors to contribute to. So we can see that the value. In Zacatecas state, we did a case of comparing Ving and Sunflower. Where we actually validated that by using Sunflower in the innovation plot and Ving in the control plot, which is the typical product in that region, we could see that maybe the benefit cost ratio of using Sunflower could be actually better. So we were accompanying some producers to move from bean to Sunflower and to understand also what was the estimated demand for Sunflower. So this is a sample of some pictures of workshops that we conducted in 2016. And we reached about 2,640 producers and other players in this adoption or access to farmer market linkages component. Some other cases that I wanted to share with you is the project in Yucatan. In this project, we have a component to promote land-raised maize in niche markets. So some of the activities that we have been leading to that objective is participatory workshop with farmers to review the project's commercialization strategy. So as Link suggests, we don't arrive to a community and say, this is what you need to do. Rather, we go there, we work with farmers, we understand through participatory workshops what they want to do, if they want to actually trade with their products, if they feel comfortable with the way they are managing their selling and so on. Then we work on a catalogue to promote land-raised maize, which has been kind of a complex exercise because we need to carefully assess what is the available volume that can be traded, especially in communities that have not been trading before. So this is part of the exercises that we are doing. We review and provide to the donor and to other interested parties key considerations in terms of pricing and logistics. And the last activity that we are doing is actually a tasting workshop where Natalia Palacios is helping to plan, which is scheduled for next January, where we will have chef and consumers characterizing organolectic characteristics of these three selected maize varieties that have maybe a volume higher than others in the peninsula Yucatan and that can be traded and appreciated by chefs and the consumers. So this slide shows part of the variables that we have been reading in the field, that we have been observing in the field and that we include into our recommendations to the players. So for instance in the case of land-raised maize producing in the peninsula Yucatan, it of course belongs to the Milpa system. So Milpa system is highly conditioned by weather and by seasonality of Milpa itself. Then in terms of prices, we have observed in local markets that price varies from 5 to 12 pesos the kilo. There are also opportunities to add extra value to products, for instance, premium quality or certification. To date, there is no extra value to the product itself. So we think there is an opportunity there to increase somehow the price that the farmers would receive. And also it's very important that we are always highlighting this part. In order to avoid local market distortions, we need further understanding or detailed understanding of local market dynamics to establish maximum buying prices. So high prices might differ existing equilibrium in terms of self-consumption or internal trade within the community. Those are some of the variables under affection that we have been seeing how the price shapes in a specific local market. So this takes us to the whole range of products or projects that we are developing. So lately we have been writing and implementing projects on responsible sourcing as you have seen. So this is kind of a purpose that can be applied to most of them, kind of the objective that we want to pursue. So to build and to consolidate a commercially sound responsible sourcing model aligned with the vision, procedures and requirement of the agro industry, promoting the development of business relationships based on trust, stability and reciprocal profit generation, and allowing companies to meet the local maize and wheat demand. As we have been seeing and as we have been discussing for the last years, CEMIT has now this vision, this wider vision on interventions in the value chain. And we have seen that several companies have an interest in shifting from imports to establishing long term relationships with local producers of maize or wheat. So that's kind of the work that we are doing with, as I was saying before, Keilox, Nestle or Bimbo. So we kind of combine the pool and the push mechanism to create an enabling environment for responsible sourcing projects to thrive. Those are at the left. We have some activities that we do in terms of pool or push. As you can see value chain mapping and analysis, support to private sector in building a reliable local procurement, capacity development, the support on sustainable intensification with technologies and agronomy that we do in every project, market-oriented production. And of course, another value that we are shaping is traceability and sustainability indicators all the way from farm to the company. So here we have some drawings on what kind of interventions do we do and how do we explain it. So for instance, this is the case of Nestle. And Nestle wants to increase the rate of local procurement of maize in the state of Guanajuato, which is actually quite low now and depends on a couple of intermediaries. And this is kind of the way we saw it. So we see, okay, there is this company that has a high volume demand. There are farmers everywhere in the state. Most of them are disconnected. Some receive technical assistance but it's just occasionally. And there are not enough, there is not maybe enough infrastructure in the region in terms of storage or logistics. So there are some problems that we have identified. So how can we solve these problems? Well, in terms of reaching, we can help identifying farmers and help them to or convince them to create organizations. So this SPR is Sociedad de Producción Rural. So it's farming organizations getting together. So technical assistance is provided by the project or by aligned projects. In this case, the government of Guanajuato is paying Masaguro Guanajuato, is funding Masaguro Guanajuato. And that helps, of course, to other players that want to buy maize in the region. Maize or wheat, actually. In the case of Nestle, it's maize and wheat. Then we have a component of work with the communities. And that was for the specific request of the donors. So we are promoting biofortified maize or QPM in some self-consumption areas or smaller farmers in the state of Guanajuato. We developed sustainability indicators together with the company. And we are making sure with our monitoring evaluation system that those indicators are being captured. Then we also work with a number of partners but also financial partners to make sure that there is…to make sure that the infrastructure needed for this project to work is built, is in place. And, well, this is kind of the drawing of the intervention. And we also understand that there are several kind of producers in this scenario. And that in parallel, we are going to work with these three kind of group of producers. And we are actually helping them to transition from one category to other category. So here, for instance, category C would be the producers who are not linked to markets. And that are living like far from the company reach out. So we work with them to make them visible the importance of working together, of forming organizations, increasing the quality, the homogeneity of their product. So hopefully these producers would transition into group B, which are farmers who are already organized. But they are not adding extra value. They are selling their products to maybe a copy of others to those who are storage and then sell to the company. So maybe if these organizations could do their own storage, could add some value or could help… It could get a better price for the service they provide. And we have the aggregadores comerciales who are those who typically have been working with the company. So Nestlé or other companies, of course, rely on big aggregators. But the percentage of grain that they obtain from these aggregators is going to reduce as a percentage as other farmers become suppliers as well of the company. So this is an example of work instead with Kellogg's where we have been identifying what were the main bottlenecks between the company and the main aggregator that they deal with. So whoever is familiar with, so whoever is familiar with, so whoever is familiar with link methodology and we will understand that this is one of the tools that we utilize, which is a scorecard analysis, where we see the perception of how good, how healthy is the relationship and the mutual understanding between the company and the main aggregator. And when we see that there is a difference in reading or understanding of the position, then we kind of try to solve this difference. Then we do a value chain. We have done a value chain risk matrix understanding what were the main factors that could affect the sustainability of the company business. And we provided this kind of exercises, which is not Chinese but almost, but the company has the code. So I didn't want to put here exactly what were the recommendations because this is of course confidential information. But we identified different kind of risks. We identified possible mitigation strategies and suggested route of action. So this is also an example of value chain map that we conducted for this last project. And well, this takes me to the last slide, which is what is coming. We have been quite, I would say, quite dynamic during the last few months in incorporating new topics. We would like to see what is the, what are the opportunities to include public procurement, responsible public procurement into the grain sector. So there are some projects in Brazil and also in the European Union of governments buying grain for, I don't know, it can be for the jail, for the patient system, for the schools. And so this public expenditure in food is being reoriented to more, to incorporate some sustainable indicators or awareness, kind of awareness. Another area of work is using the information communication tools for better trustability and transparency. And it is interesting to notice that IBM or Walmart have been working with blockchain technology to incorporate those elements of high-end technology into the food sector. And we think that CIMIT could also play a role there. We are working on understanding what could be actually our fit. And there are organizations such as the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative or ICL Alliance, which actually support companies in developing sustainability standards. And we are in contact with these organizations to understand what is coming next in terms of sustainability indicators so that we can be ready to provide that kind of information to the companies or to whoever we are working with in projects. And another element that we would like to incorporate within next year maybe is participatory guarantee systems or participatory certification also known as participatory certification as close to zero cost option for farmers to certify their products, which we think is something that there are several cases of success, particularly in Asia. In Asia, now Mexico is kind of starting to explore this self-certification scheme, we think is something where we can contribute to. And that was about it. I hope you… If you have questions now, we have some minutes and I'm happy to respond. Thank you, Victor, for the presentation. I think you showed a lot of tools, which is always nice, I think, showing really how to do it. Of course, my question is about scaling because the word even popped up. Maybe you can go to… I think it's the fifth slide or so where you had this flowchart and then at the end it was like… And now we need to scale out. Yeah, that one. So, my question is… Now, you say we focus very much on the design and implementation and then the next step would be scale out, right? So, I assume that in the first two blocks you reach maybe hundreds or thousands of beneficiary basically. And the next you want to go to millions, right? So, I think you would agree that this is maybe more complex than what we're actually doing now. So, the question is how do you see the role in supporting that scaling out process and B, who should take the leadership on that block then if we are not going to do it? Well, I think scaling out has to go through different steps or through different phases. And to the last station we are probably not going to be the lead of that reaching millions. But we can do some… We can do some interventions in a way to make sure that a process is validated and it works out. So, for instance, it wouldn't be enough if we assume it start implementing the link methodology and think, look, this is something which is working out but we don't help others to do that and we don't count on others' opinion to do that. So, a first step into this scaling out exercise is to work with different partners who are private small companies providing services to farmers in Mexico that have been trained and are using themselves this methodology and seeing if there is any value in that. So, when they understand that that's useful they will do their own business by providing that service. And that's a first step to scale out. Then the same thing similarly it works with the companies. So, the companies when they see that a pilot is working out successfully for them. For instance, in the case of Bimbo it's very clear that what they want to do is a pilot because they want to focus on, I don't know, it's not even 10% of their total procurement. But the idea is to scale it out to other regions, to other countries, to other crops. Or maybe in the case of Bimbo not to other crops but maybe in the case of Kellogg's that they have more different ingredients, they would do that in other ingredients. So, we just kind of put the seed in there and see if we can support to the scale out process. It's a complex topic but I think we are working on that. Could you tell us more about the indicators of sustainable farming and whether those all get into climate change, amelioration or any of those aspects? There are indicators in most of our projects. We have indicators of knowledge of environmental area and of production or productivity. So, in terms of farmer market linkages we are more focusing on those having to deal with productivity. As I refer briefly, there are several organizations working on sustainability indicators for the agricultural sector. So, we discuss with a specific donor in each case what kind of indicators are you interested in. Some of them, most of the indicators that the company are interested in belong to the environmental part or to the income part. So, I want my farmers to be more successful in terms of return of investment or I want my farmers to have a better management of the water. So, some of them are managed by our colleagues of the agronomics and some others are work out by ourselves. So, these are the ones that we are kind of monitoring more closely, controlling. So, we understand that it's not only about producing more but about being more competitive in the way you produce. And by indicating and by monitoring that over the years we understand that as a farmer has been successful in incorporating more profit into its business. Then there is this last indicator I was referring before market effective participation index. It refers to what extent a farmer is aware of the existence of different markets and how he or she plan strategically his production towards meeting market demands. So, that's an indicator that after a number of years we understand how that farmer has transitioned and that is valuable for us to understand whether it makes sense our intervention or not. Still is an area under constant development and review but I hope this addresses a bit your question. Can I add a question to that though? Yeah. Excuse me, Victor, please use the microphone. I just had a question. Okay. All right. So, our job is international agricultural research. So, we should also be interested in ensuring comparability across countries, regions and so on. So, these indicators, you know, it would help if we can ensure some kind of comparability with, say, what we're doing in South Asia. So, number one would be water use efficiency, two, nutrient use efficiency, and three, emissions. And are they covered or not? So, what we're doing? Well, what we're doing? Well, what we're doing? I don't know. Do you want to? Yeah. Just, I mean, I think it's a bit misleading putting this one. This is a selection of indicators as an example. There is the table of indicators which includes profitability and greenhouse gases. And it's a whole full table that has been developed. This is an extract which is also fed into the discussions with monitoring and evaluation and learning unit or whatever it is. And that is also working across with the CGIAR. The working group. So, it's not that this is just a selection. So, it may be a bit misleading by putting these out. I think, I mean, this is an example of a specific project. Where it is important to highlight is indeed not all projects are measuring all the indicators. So, maybe the next step of discussion is what are the minimal indicators that we agree across regions that you should measure. Being part of those discussions, it becomes very interesting because usually we step out of the meeting saying every time should be the minimum indicators you should measure. Because depending the socioeconomist is there, this is this, etc. On the other hand, there is obviously also the dimension of the donors. So, I mean, USAID is looking at indicators. Zagarpa is looking at indicators. We have the Coneval who is doing everything for Mexico. So, I'm not sure. I mean, I don't have the answer where that ends up in the end. But somewhere, we need to evolve it. Yeah. Just to add on, on, on, on, on the indicators. There's a lot of methodological challenges also to have indicators that are robust across geographies. One aspect of indicators, especially for that type of work, are social indicators. Equity. Whether you build equity in systems with responsible sourcing, for example. It's a, it's a very interesting question. So, in CIMIT, but not only in CIMIT, we have quite a, quite a few being interested in getting methods and metrics for those indicators. And I think it's, it requires a bit more investment. So, that's part of it. Yeah. I mean, I totally agree. I have been discussing with, with Bram this for, for, for, for some time already. And, and, and the idea is that we find you first what are valid methodologies and useful indicators for both the beneficiaries that we are working with and for what the industry may demand. And then how do we streamline those indicators within the project portfolio of the program and beyond of all the different regions. I think it's interesting to look at Andrea who's, who's on maternity leave has been working on that and, and maybe she's interesting to ask her to give a presentation. But also for me, just to add, it has been quite interesting that on methodologies, et cetera, is completely different if you look at it from the, from the business perspective. Because they want those data streams to go in business continuity, which needs to be auditable by PWCs and those companies that they need to be able to translate that into financial indicators for them. Because then their insurance goes down. I mean, that's a whole, even a whole different dimension where that we may not be thinking of. But if we don't do that, we cannot connect it. And then the pool goes away of what is driving this. Because in the end, the company is creating a pool for that. So it's, I mean, it's even more, it's making it just a little bit more, more complicated. And another factor that is important is the time, is the time that it requires to capture the indicators, analyze, and kind of present them. So the industry is pressing us to have quicker response ratio than we had previously with institutional donors, which would be okay with us releasing data of two years old and saying, okay, this is the indicator of production of the state of Oaxaca 2014. And you are delivering that in 16. And so now the companies are telling us, okay, I want some system where I can see, if not in real time, at least with a delay of maximum a month, who are our beneficiaries? How are they performing in the field? How are they performing in the field? How are they performing in the field? And so it's something that we are actually trying to tackle with the BEM, the BEM, the BEM, and some other tools that Andrea and others are working on. I'm not adding anything to go. I think we could have a two hour seminar only on indicators. Yeah, we probably will. And again, I mean, you mentioned the cost benefits of indicators, you know, I mean, you can have indicators that interest many people, but they are very difficult and very costly to obtain. The upscaling of indicators as well, you know, can measure things at the field level for a few farmers, but how do you scale that, you know, when you start working in a much wider environment? And I think all those issues are of interest, I think, for Cibit because more and more also donors are asking for those indicators as a metric of success. Well, greenhouse gas emissions is the typical case where I think we should kind of work closely with C-caps and others to understand what is going to be our methodology. A question because I think that was an interesting comment and that we have been discussing. And just for you to talk a bit about that, how do we, I mean, how do we avoid or how do we at least put the signals there that by the interventions instead that we are making sure that we enter at a level playing field? Because one of the elements is you could say, I take the farmers and I put them in contact with the company, but that is not a level playing field because the company is probably much, the company is probably more experienced in the company, much more experienced with negotiating with farmers, which for them are suppliers and that's what they do. They negotiate their supply chain. So can you comment some of the tools and elements that are being thought of to avoid falling in that trap and actually creating a disparity rather than opportunities in a pool for the sustainable interventions? So one thing that we need to clarify every time is that we are not traders. So that we cannot make sure that by linking farmers to companies, business is going to happen by itself. So what we see is that we want to, on one hand, empower farmers to understand what is the value of the product they have, what are the different markets they can go to, and what are the benefits of working together or by developing formal contract farming or by developing kind of loyalty to the potential companies that are interested in their products. So that's a whole set of work. And from the other side, we work with the companies to kind of transmit the need to understand the characteristics of the farmers of the specific region where they want to source from. They, of course, they, of course, they, of course, know the people, but they don't, they might not know how they would react to changes in the environment such as changing price scenario or changing weather scenario. So this kind of awareness is important for the companies to have. And also, we have the companies to understand what are the benefits of promoting local procurement instead of imports in terms of marketing of image for the companies and that they are seeing value in that. So they are kind of open now to consider buying local. I have an issue that we know that Mexico is divided into monocropping zones. We have and so on. So we want to, as a part of sustainable intensification, we want diversification as one of the components. On the other side, the contract farming is more towards specific quality, trade, commodity, and monocropping suits contract farming and vice versa. How do you see diversification and market linkage in this kind of intervention? Contract farming should be used only if useful. So that means that not all the companies and not all farmer groups are seeing value in contract farming because contract farming is limited by stipulated programs. So in that case Mexico and Zagarpa has a service of contract agriculture which proved to be useful and popular in some regions and not in others. So to start with this thing, for us contract farming is not an obligation. So in terms of what products do we suggest in crop rotation, we always start from understanding agronomics. So whenever we see that there are several options in terms of agronomy appropriate rotation, we see out of those who is the one, what is the one that makes more sense from a market perspective. But not the other way around. We don't see, we don't say, okay, in Bajio there is a new factory of oil, of papas, fritas, and then we need to get oil from this kind of leguminosas. So we just understand in the system which is needed, which is kind of helping to nurture soils, and then out of that we provide some recommendation. Hi, I have a question. Especially you are talking a lot about markets, specifically about big markets in the slave people. What about small scale farmers? If we see them, yes, of course, also as producers and as consumers of their own cereals as maize. And then if we try to connect them with, you say, chefs or these other high-level restaurants, how do we ensure that we, that they can still have their own volume for self-consumption? And they, if we give them a nice price and all these contracts, of course, it's going to be a really nice incentive to sell everything or most of it. And then what are they going to eat if they prefer to eat their own maize? And perhaps we are going to make a different type of impact in their diets. Yeah, well, I think that was pointed out. I mean, we do that by carefully assessing case by case. First, we cannot say that large farmers supply only large companies. So the idea is that large companies also supply from small and medium farmers that get organized. That's what we are doing in Bajio, that we are doing in Sinaloa, not so much, but in Estado de Mexico, yes, we are doing that. For those niche market pool, for that niche market pool, that they want maybe some very specific products, land-raised maize. We have been doing this exercise community by community in Peninsula de Yucatan to understand what is the percentage of product that they consume, what is the percentage of product that they trade in their communities. So we don't affect that. We help them to increase their production. And with that surplus of production, we start talking about selling that. So the volumes are incredibly low for the first year. Then we want to help them to make, to see, okay, maybe they have three hectares of land in average. They are planting less than an hectare because it's what they need. But maybe next year they will think, okay, I'm going to duplicate my production because I know I will have someone who is going to buy from me. So volume setting and price setting is key and it's something that we work on in every specific community. This is very time demanding. So what we would want to do is that we have the private sector, I mean, small companies, farm advisors, despatches, agricolas, that provide that service to farmers. And that we would also enjoy and get them together. Organizations and Stay ferenties and things can store along with those small companies, just like stock in economics, that is ajest quarterly. And just a little happy for theporary of the đầuing of the Minuten is wrapping up with this project. It's also a bit more time so that we can put this酒 is谷 Its twenties. No more people that are over? No more questions or comments, comments? Thank you very much.
