Nonprofits & Activism
 First of all, thank you everyone for taking your time and becoming part of the webinar. This webinar is part of Partners in Prosperity's Multilingual Webinar Series, where we are trying to mobilize and spread awareness about water management, importance of water conservation, and how to develop techniques where water can be managed well in agriculture. My name is Shrestha Sharma and I'm working as a coordinator in Policy Impact with Partners in Prosperity. Now I will just introduce you to a project called VAPRO, which we have been doing from last five years now. So under this water productivity project or VAPRO, we're essentially trying to create agri-value chains where the rice is produced using water efficient farming techniques and the procurement rice is exported to our market partners like Coop, Mars and LTE Foods. Anyone who would like to know more about it can speak to me personally. Going ahead into the discussion, I will just introduce two speakers. First we have Ms. Lauke Kokmans. Thank you so much Lauke for being part of the webinar. She is heading the Global Sustainable Sourcing part at Mars Food currently. She has been working in areas of project management as well as I would ask you to kindly mute your videos. We're having noise in the background. Yeah, she has been working in project management as well as developing sustainable sourcing strategies. Thank you Lauke for joining us. Then Dr. Kamal Wadda has still not joined us. We cannot address him as of now. Moving to the next speaker, we have Dr. Sudhir Yadav. Thank you so much, Sudhir, for being part of today's session. He's a senior scientist at IRRI, International Rice Research Institute. Currently, he is leading the theme of environmentally sustainable methods in rice-based systems. So, we have Mr. S. K. Sharma. He is the Director of Central Water Commission, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development. Under River Development and Ganga Rejuvenations, Government of India. And as he said, his news presentation shall be his own and not necessarily representing the government or his department's opinions. Moving ahead with the discussion, I will just give the lead to Mr. Sharma now. And we will discuss the first question, which is what is the importance of water in agriculture and how we can manage it? Dr. Sharma, over to you. Dr. Sharma, over to you. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Answer to the question, what is the importance of water in agriculture? I would like to start from a little, a little, with a little perspective. At the time of independence, our population was only 33 crores, 330 million. Now we are 1.3 billion. And the agriculture issue was such that at that time, we were not finding it possible to feed our own people. Now we have done a lot of improvement, a lot of management issues. They are still left. Because you see, what was correct at that time, the Green Revolution, now things have changed. Now we have become almost times a population, but we were then at that time. And there are some serious quality issues, quantity issues of water. Now to the question, what is the importance of water in agriculture? Now, India is such a country that whatever we have, whatever resources, whatever inputs we have on our, at our disposal, we must leverage them. We must leverage them for our benefit. And what do we have here is water. There are some countries which are, which are quite water deficient. For example, in Israel, the per unit water availability is less than 100. And we are having a lot of water availability. So, in the country, we are having a lot of water availability. So, the only issue is that we have to be able to feed our own people. So, the only issue is that we have to be able to feed our own people. Mr. Sharma, we couldn't hear you. I think there's some technical issue. I can't solve this problem. Mr. Sharma, then... Mr. Sharma, then... Mr. Sharma, then... Hello? Hello? Mr. Sharma, yes, yes, sir. We can hear you, Nani. Okay. So, whatever... What is the... Coming back to the question, what is the importance of water in agriculture? In agriculture, water is very much important because it is one of the few resources which we have at our disposal, which we can leverage to feed our people, to keep our country stable and prosperous and all the rest. So, we cannot straight away discount water and we cannot also leave aside the issues of environment, about quality and all. So, what we will really need is to have a multi-fisted approach. We cannot... In my opinion, my personal opinion, we cannot straight away neglect our supply-side results or supply-side our answers. And either we can neglect our demand-side options. We have to manage... We have to do a tight-group balancing act. So, I think this is... This is how I would like to conclude is that we will have to manage it by making a very fine, a very delicate balance between our demand-side solution and supply-side solution. We cannot straight away... We remain dependent upon one of them. So, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Sharma. Thank you so much for sharing your views. You are absolutely correct that how there should be a balance, well maintained, between how much we are demanding and how much we are producing against what resources are involved. Because often what the debate is that are we really selling our crops or for that matter rice or are we really selling water? So, if we manage our water well, then of course that can be looked after. Thank you so much. I would request you to mute your video. Coming to the next questions, which is again one of the very important questions, is understanding the basics of what we are trying to do. And what is sustainable agriculture really? And right now today we have with us water and environment group from Uttarakhand who has done extensive work in developing water management techniques. And we also have farmers in Haryana who are trying to replicate this model. But before heading into them and listening to their questions and views, I would request Lauke to present our views on this second question. What is sustainable agriculture and why do we need it? Thank you so much for the opportunity to share more about what is sustainable agriculture and why do we need it? And maybe from the perspective of a global big company. I would like to share my screen. Then you need to give me permission Sharma. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Thank you. If you can see my screen, please let me know. We can't see your screen right now. You cannot? Yeah, what did you share? If you can see it, please let me know. We can't see your screen. Yes. You can? Yeah. Perfect. Okay, excellent. So I work for Mars Food. We are part of the big Mars Inc company. And we are owners of the biggest global rice brands. And today I would like to share a little bit background like why sustainable rice becomes more and more important in countries like Europe, the US. But why it's also important for companies like Mars. So first of all, as Mars is a family and company. And we find it very important that we can make an impact. So it's important we can drive change. We can also have an impact for people, for planets. Can everyone go on mute please? Yeah. I think you are good now. Okay, sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. And driving impact is key. Also we identified within Mars our top products. And we can see that rice, which is using 40% of the world's irrigation available. As business we should act upon water reduction. So that's something we do. Yeah. Yeah. Also why sustainable rice is important. It's also important that we can source basmati. It's growing. It's growing in Europe. It's growing in the States. People want to eat this fragrant rice. So it's important we can source from India. So it's important we can source quality and health and safety rice. That's always number one. But we also think in the future. So also we want to source our basmati rice. So we need a long-term supply. Well, if water aquifers are dropping, we need to act upon this. We need to think in the future. For that reason, we are now partnering in the WAPRO program. And we really want to have a water stewardship approach to ensure we also have basmati rice in 10 years time. Even though we are very small, of course. But for that reason, we're partnering with our suppliers. But we're also very active in platforms as well. Like the sustainable rice platform. Yes. Another aspect like why is sustainability important? It's important for our own associates, our own employees in Mars. And of course, we also need to change it into growth in the business. So for instance, what now you see is very important. Consumers, they want to know where's their food coming from. It's called the trust chain. They want to know where it's grown, where it's coming from. And we do this, for instance, by putting stories on the back of the pack. And we show how much water is saved by farmers that grow great basmati rice. So having this in mind, this is more like why it's so important that we work on sustainability. Thinking about the future. Yeah. Then as a business, we have set goals. So we said we can't do it on our own. So we member and take leadership in the rice platform. And I think that's also something we're now working on in India. We have plans to set up a national chapter about sustainable rice platform. We also said we want to source rice from the sustainable rice platform standard. That's one way how you can measure that farms are growing sustainable rice, which is key. But we also say this is not enough. So we also say farmers, they need income. Otherwise, it cannot join on profits from any program. So we need to improve yields, have better access to finance. I think also, let's say how farmers can sell their products like straw. So we need to work on income. And today's topic is about water use. So in high water stress areas, we need to reduce the water use. And of course, this is all linked to each other. We cannot only reduce the water use. We cannot reduce the water use. Okay, I think there's some technical issue. We can't show you properly. We cannot do it on our own. So by our partners, we should be in. Okay, okay. Should I? Did you hear my previous slides about the goals? We can't do it properly. Yeah. Should I do it again? Yeah, if you can, that would be really nice. Thank you. Okay. So as a company, we have set goals. And first of all, we acknowledge we cannot do it on our own. So for that reason, we have joined the sustainable rice platform. Both the platform, as well as adopting the rice standards. We also really supporting that in India, we set up a national chapter. So that actors can be united in advocating for sustainable rice. In our goals, we don't only see it as SRP is the only one solution. We also work on income and water use. So that means we need to work on better work capital for rice growers, increasing yields, lowering input costs. As well, we see it, we need to work on water stewardship. And all the goals, of course, are interlinked together and something we should embed in a similar framework. Could you hear me now? Yeah, we are with you. Okay. Okay, good. Yeah. We can't do it on our own. So we're very active with a lot of different partners we're having who know this context very well. And we work closely with our suppliers. We are very advocating that we work through Miller associations to really drive sector change. Then maybe the final slides. What we always see that we need to think about the future long-term view. So we need to think how can we change the system. So our dream, our vision is Haryana should be an attractive area that we can source high quality basmati with sufficient water in the future. But that only starts with if rice farmers, they are entrepreneurs, they think as entrepreneurs, so grow rice and wheat in a system. And as well also farmers, they become stewards themselves of the environment. They need this well-functioning agri-service system. So good governance should be there. There should be a good private sector supporting them. So what we do now, we work with our partners on having a good rice value chain. We need to work on adoption of climate smart practices. And we need to improve the enabling environment, so the policy part. So I would stop here and then give it to the next speaker. Thank you, Alauke. In fact, you've raised very important points that says that farmers have to start working as water stewards really. However, my question really is, as a farmer, as someone who is directly working on field, as someone who has to make a choice, they need to totally understand the business model. So when you say the farmers have to become entrepreneurs, they also have to find the utility of choosing water deficient techniques over the conventional farming techniques. So if you have anything to add on that part. Yeah, I so agree. The business case should be very clear. So we always see the income going hand in hand with water. So for instance, we work now on a pre-finance model together with Rabobank. So that farmers can do for instance laser leveling as a technique, which also will increase yields. As well, it will reduce water as well. So that's just one example. As well, we look at for instance how we can use the byproducts of rice. For instance, they sell the straw. So we always need to think through longer term how to have this model as well. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely correct. Now I would like to open our floor for questions. So the farmers were sitting directly in Haryana. In fact, it is important that you raise the point of Haryana because 86% of the exported rice is alone coming from Haryana of the whole of the country. So I would request my colleague sitting in Haryana, Pabitriji, to kindly open this video. And maybe we can hear from what farmers have to say. And see. lasail gasOD If you can put it some afterlife. If you can put it some served. I am not listening to you. What is the importance of? Okay give me a minute, I am trying to translate and understand. What? Hello? Yes, Abhita Ji tell me. I think there is some confusion. Babitha Ji maybe you want to use the chat section so that we can read the question from there. At this side? The question from the farmer is how can rain water be consumed? How can rain water be consumed? How can the farmer panjure rain water? Okay, thank you Abhita Ji for your question. So Lauke and Mr Sharma who spoke a while back. I would request anyone of you who would like to take this question. I think Sharma J is not with us anymore. So Lauke would like to address this question with how rain water can be used? Actually I think Sudhir might be the best one to answer because he is more the water specialist of Erie. I can give my thoughts for collecting rain water. I better leave it to the more water specialist. Yeah. Dr Sudhir if you would. Dr Sudhir we can't hear you. I think there is some... Nothing. You are worth it too many. I hope to hear you boss因为 Phil,ましたng Who Of What You Can You Hear Me Now Ratsang, Fraktion��을. You can hear me now? We did see you. How are you? I'm so sorry, I just don't see you. yes yeah it's all technology so thank you very much and I'm very glad to see you know all farmers and just just to inform them I'm also from Haryana so that's very kind of good moment to see people from my state the question which has been asked and and for farmer I'm sitting in Manila working for a international organization for rice so the question which has been asked I think question is not how to you know use rainwater I'm looking at the chat box question is how to help in raising the groundwater table which is kind of related question that so there is a two part first we need to understand why groundwater is going down so that's that's first part and the second part is how we can help so there has been a lot of research done by by universities by ICR center on how you can capture rainwater and how that can be kind of linked to the aquifers so they basically there has been work done by different centers where at the corner of your their field they kind of installed a bore well if you want to call it and then that that that act as a water harvesting and the rainwater goes directly to the aquifer so the first part is that by that whatever runoff is happening that goes to your aquifer but the more importantly thing is that the the degree with which we can recharge the groundwater that is still less than the rate which we are extracting the water so I think we need to also control the extraction part that how we will reduce our extraction so that the depression rate can be reduced so briefly I'll stop here thank you so much for sharing your views with us and what you say is it's it's very important that how some technique which has to be introduced on ground needs to be done and just move into the next question which we have from Uttarakhand is what techniques can be adopted in Rabi crop management where we are dependent on ground water sources so if any of our speakers would like to answer this question I mean dr. Sudhir since we you are this expert for sending rice I would know again yes the question is not for rice that's for Rabi season and it's very very interesting that how we look from the system perspective not only from from rice or Rabi season there has been a lot of work done in in Eastern India especially in Eastern Uttarapar days especially they are I'm sure some of the farmers are familiar about dry seeded rice and then not for rice but then they go for early seeding of wheat to capture the residual soil moisture with this small decision about what we call window operation you can reduce one irrigation so there is a lot of work going on how in in Eastern Uttarapar days basically we talk about you know two to three irrigation maximum two irrigation so if you can with system thinking if you can capture the residual moisture from rice starting early with with rice with with dry seeded rice and then capturing the residual moisture going with that's not in Eastern Uttarapar days but in a lot of work in Punjab Haryana is going on using straw as a mulch so with happy seeder a lot of work is going on in Haryana but that's not much in Uttar Pradesh in Uttar Pradesh I think there is a lot of scope to go for early planting of wheat and using the residual moisture of rice rather than wasting it yeah thank you so much Dr. Sudhir for telling us how that how the bi-products can also be cured and using the natural moisture of rice rather than wasting it yeah thank you so much Dr. Sudhir for telling us how that how the bi-products can also be used we have a couple of questions coming over and we would like our speakers to answer them unfortunately we didn't have Dr. Vata with us nevertheless we could go forward and moving towards the third question we would have these answers questions answered in the next session we would close the question around session for now and then move ahead to the third question of today's presentation which is how can technology be used in improvising agricultural practices so Dr. Sudhir if you can enlighten us with your views sure and I think this will also help to address some of the questions which are coming which are indeed very interesting so when we talk about how technology can be used to improvise agricultural practices I think we need to think about what we mean by technologies people in you know see technology from different perspectives technology can be per se kind of practice you know the tools or the the recommendation technology can be used to kind of kind of enabling tools to ease the decision making and technology can be also in terms of catalyzing the adoption of improved practices so it depends on how we define the technology and I'll briefly talk about all three so when we say about technology so people generally say technology as something new a new product questions are coming like drip irrigations and and and and and the documents about laser leveling so it depends on what is our purpose is if our purpose is kind of applying the less irrigation water then we can go with the technology like laser leveling so laser leveling will basically what will it will help that the amount of water which you applied right now you can go with the technology like laser leveling laser leveling so laser leveling so laser leveling will basically what will it will help that the amount of water which you applied whether you apply like five centimeter standing water 10 centimeter whatever you apply to reach to that amount level the water quantity required will be less and I think at least in India there has been sufficient adoption of laser leveling a load in Punjab but now it's speaking in Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar a load and there is a clear visible benefit of laser leveling in terms of reducing the water and and increasing the yield but then also if there are other technology like if you don't know if you want to reduce or you want to increase the interval between two irrigations so how frequently you are applying irrigation and then the technology like alternate wetting and drying which is is again quite quite famous now in in South Asia that you should know continuous flooding you can dry your field to certain level and there is a simple tool to do that but then we also talk about technology where you can reduce the amount of water but you can't reduce the frequency so it's a frequent application of water that is drip drip so in drip so in drip we have a technology where the amount of water can be significantly reduced but you need to apply it like more or less daily because it meets the air flow translation demand so the point here is it depends on what is the what are the challenges in the region similarly when it comes to water it's not only water per se it's also energy in Punjab and Haryana it's most of the pumps are on electricity as we go down in eastern side there is a lot of diesel operated pump and then it comes to like how we can reduce the energy footprint also and there are different solutions especially in the in the coastal regions there has been a lot of adoption of axial flow pump compared to centrifugal pump where your energy footprint can be significantly reduced or there has been a lot of projects now started by government of India on solar power so it's kind of green energy so it's kind of green energy using the green energy this is kind of one one lens using irrigation or energy the other lens in terms of improving the adaptation you know capacity of the farmer and in that one some of the farmer ask about water harvesting so basically if you if you can harvest the water that improve your you know capacity to adapt you know like if you are going through droughts so you can apply supplementary irrigation and there is a lot of work on crop distribution method like dry seeded rice but if you can allow me to share the screen can you hear me okay thank you can you see my my screen i i think you are mute so i'm assuming that you are able to see yes yes i'm able to see i'm sorry we can't uh see your screen yeah oh okay can you see now not really we can't see your screen we can't see your screen you need to click twice on on like share and then you need to do one more permission step let me try i think you need to click twice and then you can see yeah let's see yeah let's see yeah now we can okay you can you can see um so basically um what it went to different screen so not sure which screen you are looking at um all right let's let's let's let's yeah okay let's let's let's let's let's simple so what i mean here that we generally as a as a researcher we generally open a lot of technology to farmers and sometimes made them confused we sometimes we are very much technology driven and in real sense i think what farmer need help on is making a decision that what what are the best way to make the decision what technology can be picked and technology can be picked and technology is not only about like following laser leveling or not the decision is whether laser leveling is required or not or after how many years laser leveling is required whether for your system uh system uh uh drip is a good option so maybe you are getting enough rain you you target the system game so there is a lot of work which is required in terms of helping farmer in decision making and lawki was talking about enabling environment and this is similar to that one that where you invest on uh building the capacity of the system that is also with policy lens but then now there are a lot of ict iot based tool which are very powerful in terms of picking the right technology which are suitable for a particular reason farmers in haryana their questions are different than farmers in uttar and farmers in bihar so we cannot fit one size to all and it's very very important that we we use now the tools in terms of leaving it with farmers rather than telling that this is best for you leaving with them to pick what is best for them because they are the kind of best people to understand their agro environment understand their challenge and i think what we can do is helping them in terms of uh exploring the cafeteria of technologies and and telling them the pros and cons of different technologies and and and then these tools can also help to catalyze the chains um which are required um i can see that it's there's one more slide which is basically saying that we have technologies but and we know the stakeholder need but technology generally doesn't reach to the stakeholders and that's the gap which we need to fill that how how uh what kind of now tools we can develop so that we can reach uh as much as near to farmers i'll stop here for now all right thank you uh so much dr sudhir you're absolutely correct in how we have been uh we do need to enable the farmers to make it in from choice and it and this enabling factor could have multiple avenues one could be to give them the appropriate information of what the kind of facilities available the kind of videos uh or just share the screen or even at the part of the government of what in terms of what kind of initiatives and the schemes are available for example subsidies we have been involved in this part of enabling farmers by training them in various kinds of uh for a few water efficient farming techniques and one of which was water stewardship which was being done under our water productivity project so uh jotsna from our utarakhand office is connected to us and we have three and four jalsakis who were the community persons working directly with the farmers on how uh they developed and also made sure that the farmers know what they're doing and also explaining them that how they can implement these from last many years so maybe we could hear her views and also hear directly from some of our jalsakis if you would allow me the farmers to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us yes yes yes yes we would like to uh hear and then just before heading into that uh we're really glad that we have our partners from uh pakistan joining us for the webinar who are implementing the water productivity project in pakistan which we have been doing in india so we would like to hear their views as well sometime and uh yeah jotsna yes yeah just like you would can tell us about the experience of working within the community enabling the farmers and how jalsakis work directly on ground yes uh jalsakis have been working in the water productivity uh project and they have been monitoring the water use in uh these technologies actually all these technologies have been demonstrated in the field areas sri awd and intercropping so jalsakis's role was to monitor the label of water and irrigation uh during the past three years and as the results we had analyzed it has been uh noticed that 25 percent of water saving has been uh 23 to 25 percent water saving has been experienced through these practices so uh jalsakis uh other than this um uh water monitoring part they have created water and environment groups in uh region of uh nanita district where our project is being is going on so the water and environment uh main purpose is to uh monitor and maintain the water infrastructures and aware uh community members towards uh water use sustainable water use yeah in fact uh for everyone we have been successfully able to mobilize and train 4500 farmers in a project and how this word of mouth works among the farmers community is that when some one village or say a particular block is being trained or being told about what is happening it's it's slowly uh spreads among the other farmers and again what love was talking about that if we present them with the lucrative business model which is that if they're producing water efficient or maybe srp standards rise that can be easily exported and given at a good price if i am correct okay yes yeah absolutely uh well since we're done with the uh what the speakers have to say we're still one question left i would request a vapor uh partners from pakistan if they would want to and there's online questions as well like what are the low cost technology that can be adopted by farmers without even increasing costs yeah yeah if you would like to go ahead and do answers because to here and then we can head into questions so ali has joined us from pakistan ali can you hear us he is among the gapra partners i think there's some technical errors in the country anyway let's go ahead and and take answers uh one questions one by one so um can drip irrigation system be used in uh body cultivation and that's something a reoccurring question and i think dr sudhir you would like to give your opinion um so yes uh definitely there has been a lot of work done uh of using drip uh you know in rice uh i'm familiar the work was done in haryana also in canal work was done in modipuram also work was done however there's another question that uh can we kind of save water without uh additional investment you know so that's kind of uh the scenario that uh when it comes to the paddy cultivation um there's the initial investment with the drip and the technology is still kind of settling i'm speaking on on my perspective that uh from it's it's it's definitely the research done but for adoption of farmer it's it's still a bit expensive so that now the the many many private uh companies are working on low cost drip irrigation system uh but the the adoption for drip is still low in very low in in rice because they they don't see kind of the output uh against the investment so the marginal cost is very high while uh in in a lot of rain fed area in in uttar pradesh we have far from there they have started to use this low cost drip irrigation in the dry season for growing vegetables and there is a like it's it's very high profitable uh system so it all depends on at the technology it's excellent but when farmer pick a technology it's not only from technology perspective they look it from different lengths so and that this depends on the whole system that what kind of system you have uh and then whether drip is a potential choice for you or not yeah yeah of course in fact there have been we have been the project which will be working in haryana there have been discussions whether we could implement repirigation in paddy cultivation and see if it can work there but we're also considering the factor that it has been done before but in different kinds of atmosphere and also the soil and i'm skeptical about if the kind of soil will make any difference because hilly areas will be different in in comparison to maybe areas like haryana so no there so it depends on there are two different things one is when you schedule irrigation and how you schedule irrigation whether you use drip or you use flood that is how when is interval and when will take care of soil type so when in in drip irrigation you consider the evapotranspiration so evaporation is from the soil transpiration is from the plants so you consider that one and you schedule the irrigation um but my my simple kind of question or suggestion to farmers and i'm thinking more like a farmers being grown up in haryana like if farmers are at least some progressive farmer are starting to think for uh for uh for drip so which means they are only thinking to dry their paddy field if if they can dry uh their paddy field with surface irrigation they can save a lot um i'm not saying that uh you know know drip is drip is good it can further increase the saving but in terms of what low hanging opportunity which we have with us is saving this water which we are pumping from the groundwater and that is really really kind of alarming the situation in punjab and haryana so first i think the big message is that uh if they believe drip is good that mean rice can be grown uh as like other serious life wheat so they can change it in their surface irrigation system also and then it's a step change then they can adopt probably at later stage yeah yeah thank you dr sudhir of course uh what you said definitely can be done uh so this question which is a bit convoluted with uh just giving the gist is really that what are the the possibility level initiatives that can guide water stewardship at a multi-level so it can be implemented so really what the question is trying to understand is what kind of policy change is required when water stewardship can be implemented very well in all like in regional setting in a state level setting or say a national and even international setting if nauke would like to comment and maybe later dr suthir would give his own opinion on it yeah i'm not let's say the expert of course in the in the policy part um because this is i think maybe charme you even might be yourself able to answer of course like having improved policies having incentives for rice growers is essential so i spoke earlier about the enabling environment what we see for instance in other regions where the government might have incentives for collecting rainwater for providing subsidies for using drip irrigation that's one role then of course also policies in place where maybe there might be a restriction of farmers using water in pakistan there are debates whether actually water should be paid by farmers so it just depends on the context of course yeah yeah but since you are someone who can speak for the market i would like to know your views and what capacity the markets can influence the policy what other kind of changes which can be done from your end for example the points raised before was how they can increase price when we are uh working with srp or something yeah so if we talk about premiums um as mars we need high quality basmati so we always pay for a quality premium if farmers so that already helps farmers to increase their income then we of course we work with our suppliers who have agronomists who provide coaching to farmers so every two weeks they will receive guidance how to better grow the rice which also increased yields by 15 percent of course we also work on improving let's say um better markets so market route to markets transport lowering transport costs um and then of course if they grow srp rice um we we won't expect we pay a premium like what they do in organics but we would rather see by all the interventions that farmers can benefit by growing rice in a more sustainable way yeah and if i can add uh to to lauki in terms of uh incentivize uh farmers for uh kind of climate smart uh practices one of the one of the debate which is going on um is on um providing incentives to farmers for carbon credit uh which has been already started in in western world but in asi it is not introduced and there has been and this is at macro level at country level and country hold different kind of uh funds one is which we they can access is green climate funds um which can be can percolate down uh for to provide you know additional incentive for reducing the water footprint and and carbon footprint so as you know that rice is one of the major source of methane emission so it can be uh sometimes direct sometimes indirect so if they they use the water efficiently they not only save water but they also reduce the global global warming potential so people of haryana know that what is happening in delhi in in in winter you know so uh there is a lot of work need to be done in terms of how we we do how we improve the egg practices but more importantly what what is the pull mechanism and that i think we we need to think out of the box to incentivize farmers uh uh through premium rice sporting price or through this new incentive mechanism of uh carbon footprints yeah yeah thank you so much uh dr sudi for adding your reviews and of course methane emissions are some very important side effects of coal price and if we are contributing uh towards not generating that kind of an emission into the atmosphere considering delhi's uh and india's pollution level there will be a good advantage and in terms of the ecological contribution from the farmers end but there's this concern which always comes to me and speaking from from you know putting my feet in a farmer's shoe is that why is that everything burdened over me why do i have to need to make all the uh difficult choices because essentially what matters to me is growing and just getting the better price so if you would like to comment on that or maybe lauke if you will speak i would not say it's always about the price it's more the what what we say the more crop per acre so productivity that that's actually a key one also what we see a lot in the system that a lot of rice growers are dependent on the middlemen to have loans to need to pre-finance their input costs and that actually is a huge burden on the on the final net income from rice so we now might be working more on pre-finance with which can reduce 20 percent of their financial of their input costs which are spent by paying 14 to 24 percent of taxes so rather just having the premium discussions i would rather go in in this route thinking about pre-financing dependency on middlemen and whether we can also play a role in this and i'm keen to hear because i know it's very challenging as a lot of rice growers also need the middlemen as they provide a bank not only for agriculture but also for education and other other let's say loans as well yeah yeah thank you lauke adding to that i think uh one of the participants with us as dr saatev singh was director at icid international um organization for irrigation and drainage maybe he would he would be an expert person to add comments on how changes can be done at a policy level dr saatev if you would like to add to our discussion if you would unmute yourself we can't hear you yes dr saatev we can't hear you okay are you hearing me now yeah uh maybe i don't want to spoil the party but uh this morning i was reading the newspaper and interestingly there is a study by the international food policy research institute which says that the crop burning in haryana punjab alone costs us dollar 30 billions per year to the indian economy and i don't know i think that's a very that's that's a number which is very close to the total agricultural exports of india uh basically the punjab haryana region is not the agro ecological zone for rice farming and it was introduced because of the bhaktanangal dam which provided uh sufficient water so people fish to the cash crops like the basmati rice and which is an export commodity uh so maybe uh i have been studying this problem for last two three years and it seems that punjab and haryana receives only 40 percent of the monsoon range that the west bengal and the north eastern part of india which are more suitable for rice farming receive and i don't see any research which uh gives a direction that how we can grow fragrant rice like basmati in the northeast parts of india which receives adequate monsoon rainfall and in the punjab haryana region i'm not against technology i mean i'm an engineer myself and drape and all these things can always make the the water use efficiency much higher but should we not be practicing something something which is ecologically or ecologically sustainable in the long run that's that's my question to the experts here of course there is a need for improving improving the economy of farmers in improving their income but are there other ways which we should uh we should think about or or there are other options policy options which can incentivize the the shift in farming practices uh making it more ecologically sustainable in the long run yes uh thank you dr sahideh for sharing your views uh i know we have a short time but we have two questions which are still left unanswered if you could keep it on the table now the first one is how can wise water stewardship affect the quality and quantity of the agricultural produce so essentially what is the benefit of what stewardship so if you would like to hear on it if dr sudir could say um um so basically when we are saying about uh whenever we talk about water saving uh people sometimes take it as like we are cutting off significantly it's there is a difference between water requirement of crop versus water applied to the crop and there basically it's all about the intelligence about like how much uh water need to be applied i i want to quickly uh also make the point about what uh sadee was saying that i also believe in terms of the whole window of operation thinking about how you can make a decision based on your agroecological condition and based on your water availability so you are quite the the some of the like i know the work which mars food is doing their best management practices that uh the climate smart practices which will not affect your quantity that may improve your quality but they will that will definitely not affect your quality so it's win-win situation which basically we are talking here rather than reducing quantity and quality yeah absolutely it makes also a lot of sense because if we are conserving water and managing water not only are we making an ecologically uh better choice but we are also in terms of the market making uh you know a better opportunity as raised by lauke that how premium is also being paid by companies and for that matter i know that uh mars has been paying premiums lt foods and other market leaders also being premium for better uh maintained rice um just uh this last question which is being left and answered is uh what is what are the low cost technologies that can be adopted by farmers without increasing cost if um again i think it depends on um i always go back to that what are the what are the conditions rather than saying that this technology can be can fit very well to you uh we have seen a very very high impact and again today was talking about uh this history study and another history study in eastern uh uttar pradesh where the the early planting of wheat followed by early planting of uh sorry early planting of rice followed by early planting of wheat was able to make significant change in in water productivity because they were using rain efficiently so it's not always that you need to try a new rocket it's it's sometimes it's uh the decisions which you make around the production system there are series of technologies which which can it can be adopted but again i would come back to that it all depends on what are the conditions uh and accordingly we can we can suggest the appropriate technologies thank you so much dr sudi for sharing your time and your use with us i think we just ending the uh webinar is already 3 32 and due to some internet problem we also don't have a laukay with us as of now so first of all i would like to thank everyone for uh sharing their views and the participants from radyana udraq in pakistan and different parts of the country
