 Hey it's Matt from McGee Farms and got into the wintertime now had a pretty good first year with the garden here but I think we're gonna revamp a few things we made a few mistakes that I think I'm gonna try to try to fix but also in the wintertime we're gonna try some cold weather vegetables broccoli carrots lettuce some of that and with doing that I've got some PVC pipes that I'm gonna cut down and I have these brackets right here that I'm gonna use and I'm gonna make some hoops for these and with making the hoops we're gonna put some clear plastic over it too and just keep it a little bit warmer because this is a pretty you know colder colder climate here in northeastern Missouri and we'll see how the winter garden goes so first off I'm gonna mount these on the sides and then I'm gonna cut these this half inch schedule 40 pipe down and make some make some hoops so I got the first one in and mounted and this is 31 inches wide and I cut it at six foot and I think I probably probably would have been okay at five foot I think with the if I do the other bed I'm gonna go at five foot just because the PVC is ten foot and that way I can use two sections for each pipe rather than having to waste four foot of it but I've got got that in it really wasn't too bad bending and getting it in especially being chilly out here as afraid the cold might make it a little hard to get in so I'm gonna get the rest of them gonna do another I think I'm gonna try three on here see how that works I might have to come back and do four per eight foot bed and of course the lovely thing putting these brackets in I just cleaned out the horse stall and brought the leftovers down here so now I'm getting to work in that but you know it is what it is it's a good free fertilizer so I can't complain so I'm gonna start putting the rest of these brackets in and get the rest of the hoops done so I've got a couple of the hoops up right now it's an eight foot section I'm gonna try with three see if that's strong enough I may have to come back and put a fourth one in as well I went ahead and I planted some winter vegetables in here I've got some carrots I've got some lettuce I've got some broccoli green onions I think that's all I got in right now the winter vegetables that's about the only ones we've we really eat I mean we don't eat kale we don't eat cabbage so so figure we'll try it I bought some plastic at Home Depot I don't know how it's gonna hold up or not it's a 3.5 mil just clear plastic sheeting for like a painters drop cloth so I'm getting ready to put it on I'm just gonna staple it down to the top boards see if that's gonna hold it or if the wind just gonna rip that off and I'm gonna have to put some little text and little boards on top of it so we'll see I'm getting ready to do that now and I'll show you the finished product here in just a couple of minutes meanwhile enjoy some goats all right so I've got it down in there and what I kind of did I'm gonna work on a little more is on the sides where I have the these trellises that I made out of the cattle panels I'm kind of working them in there to kind of hope help hold them down in there and I took a staple gun I went around on this side and just stapled it down really good over here I I kind of bunched it up and tied it all together probably gonna have to tie it down just a little bit better but I got thinking I'm like and I did staple it down in there but when I got over here I got thinking I'm gonna have to get in there some way to harvest them and then plant more so what I did is I found a 1x2 that I had that had been sitting in the barn forever and I wrapped the plastic sheeting up with the 1x2 and and rolled it up till it got to about where the edge is and then I used the staple gun to kind of staple it down as well and by doing that that should hopefully hold it it's gonna sit on there and hopefully that'll keep it from going up and then whenever I want in there I can I can get in there a little bit I'm gonna have to adjust it a little bit but we're gonna try this out see how it goes I've got the other one over there that I'm gonna do the same thing with and I've got on the end down here we're gonna expand it out I've got some 10 foot 2x4s we're gonna go down a little more put some more arches trellises whatever you want to call them put a few more of these in because it worked really good we just didn't have enough space and so I'm getting ready to start in on that so it's Matt from McGee Farms hope you enjoy the gardening videos as much as I do and the other stuff around the farm that we do if you like the videos give us thumbs up subscribe to the channel share it with your friends it helps the channel grow and it's always appreciated until next time have a great day
