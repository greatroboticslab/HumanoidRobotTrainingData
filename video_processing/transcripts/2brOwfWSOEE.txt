 Music Hi, my name is Colin Brookleman. My profession is farming in Matsui, British Columbia. I have blueberry farm as well as chicken farm. The chicken farm is about five hours a day of work and the blueberries is one to two hours in seasonal. In the wintertime it's very little work besides pruning. Chickens I would say has been my passion and I had to do the berries as part of paying the mortgage off. This farm is the breeder farm where we have the hatchable eggs. We have hens and roosters in this barn that create fertilized eggs that in turn create meat chickens. Music This is the location where we grow the broiler chickens that supply meat. Music For farming is rising costs. It's your mortgages are high, your utilities are high and your feed costs are high. So it puts a lot of pressure on having good performance. And another big challenge is farming is seven days a week, especially with livestock. Music This summer we had extreme heat that caused losses. I lost 75% of my production in blueberries. And thankfully the chickens were okay. We have technology that combats the heat. And especially this fall, the floods that affected all agriculture in Sumasbury. The farming community has come together in wake of the floods. And I've been volunteering when I'm able as many little to no insurance coverage. Community is everything.
