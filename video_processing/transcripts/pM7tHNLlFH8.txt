 Over the course of the winter in Wyoming, cold temperatures, freezing rain, snow, mud, and wind chill are all possible. Livestock producers use many tactics to ensure survival. Three of the most significant include weather forecasting, feeding strategy, and protection from the wind. Weather forecasting plays an important role in winter livestock production. The National Weather Service produces a cold weather advisory for newborn livestock, which can be found on their website. This and other weather reports allow producers to increase feed, move livestock, or take other precautions against the weather. Livestock's nutritional requirements increase with colder weather. If there is a wind chill, this increase can be dramatic. Most researchers agree that 20 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit is the lowest temperature dry animals can withstand with no increase in energy needs. Energy can be provided to animals with extra hay or supplements. Burr, it sure is cold out here today. Almost every pasture you see will have some mechanism for breaking the wind. The horses behind me are able to get behind this tree row to help them withstand the wind chill.
