In vain, what a élé miso What a zen unto it It was playing when we danced on that hot August night when you kissed me And it was playing in my room and you told me on the phone that you missed me It was just young love and it had to end But now I wanna feel it again So I'm waiting for the summer song To make me wanna sing along Yeah, you gotta turn the radio on But I'm waiting for a summer, waiting for a summer song We sang it on the last day of school and it felt like flying We were singing at the pool and we laughed till we were crying We screamed everywhere at the top of our lungs Didn't care who hurt and it sure was fine But I'm waiting for a summer song To make me wanna sing along You gotta turn the radio on Cause I'm waiting for a summer, waiting for a summer So I'm waiting for a summer song To make me wanna sing along You gotta turn the radio on Cause I'm waiting for a summer, waiting for a summer song I'm waiting for a summer song I'm waiting for a summer song I'm waiting for a summer song And dance Ohh Here we go Maybe not I must put a kayak I can walk you along Sometimes I'm waiting for a lesson Or aまり Room Long Oh, my God. I'll see you next time.
