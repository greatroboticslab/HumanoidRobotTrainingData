 all right so here's my my solar setup that I have going I have these two 10 watt solar cells got them both for $44 for $44 for the two solar cells pretty good deal but I still have yet to be able to test them to make absolutely sure that they're running at 10 watts each there any possibility I can zoom in on this yes no okay fine it says it says that we've only put out a hundred and sixty seven milliamp hours and I've been running this thing for hours that's lame but uh okay I need to guess me to take it out and put it in actual direct Sun on a day that's not you know I don't know patchy here and there and yeah point it directly at Sun I'll put a 10 ohm resistor on them see if they'll actually give me 10 watts 10 ohms 10 ohms oh okay anyways at 12 volts these are supposed to be 12 volt things so 12 volts 12 volts at 10 watts would be 800 milliamps and we're only doing 5 volts and 200 milliamps with two 10 watt panels so whatever like I said I've got to do actual testing outside but uh either way you know getting into the solar revolution that's pretty cool I got my my thing here you know showing me how much power is going in this thing is keeping count of how much power actually using this little thing down here is the charger circuit for my battery this is my USB battery so I'm charging up my USB battery right now and have been for hours and we're only got 167 milliamp hours in there which is crap 167 times 5 that's that's almost one watt over three hours all right bye peeps thanks
