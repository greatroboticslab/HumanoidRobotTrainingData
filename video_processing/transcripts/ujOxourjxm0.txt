 In the springtime, everything has to do with weather and conditions. Once it dries up and we're out of the heavy frost, so let's say the middle of April we'll start planting potatoes, and it takes four to six weeks to plant the crops. After that, if it's dry, we're into irrigation to keep the crops healthy. And in the summertime, we keep the program going and then we start harvest usually the first of August, as soon as the potatoes are mature enough. After two weeks, then we start harvesting and we go right to the middle of October and then we're hopefully done. We're down to regular hours in the wintertime. We do maintenance and we check all the equipment over for the following year and it never seems like we have a day that we have nothing to do. There's always something. We have lots of equipment to check out. And before we're done, it's spring again. A lot offeits for people who have not been planting a lot of crops. It comes doing great Ã‡abl igual.
