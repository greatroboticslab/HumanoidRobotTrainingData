He wants to know that he could see that the Sabwan is very good. Is there any special technology required to grow Sabwan that he has got doubt? There is some other technology than growing Sabwan so that he can get more information. Or is this technology the same as Swarna? The Sabwan variety behaves the same way as Swarna. So you can grow the varieties in the same condition. If there is no flooding, they will behave exactly the same. If there is a flooding, then the Swarna Sabwan will survive better. But otherwise they perform exactly the same. The other tribes, obviously there was a problem with Sabwan. Survival is not a problem. The problem is the grain setting. How many days sit under water? After flowering, it may not get. Actually, there is a problem with 12 days. But we are seeing the susceptible check to die. Then we are disumberging. No, actually, panical exhaustion is not good. But it is not a problem with Sabwan.
