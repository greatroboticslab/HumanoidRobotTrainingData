 all Hey what's up everybody I'm Chef Mikey welcome back to Chefs Harvest Farm I am a former executive chef turned urban farmer and today I'm gonna show you how I built the ultimate no-till garden I'll go over the strategies of how I built this I started just growing food for myself and my wife basically we wanted to eat organic vegetables and I started shopping at the farmers market and then I learned that there's this whole other level of food that you can't buy in a grocery store so I wanted to grow my own high quality food when I started growing food I just started with a little raised bed box garden that I filled with soil that I bought from Home Depot and then that grew into a lot of them I had like 25 of these little boxes that I built kind of back here at one point those are all gone now it's not an efficient way to grow food I found them it just doesn't work well the reason I got into this style of agriculture and growing food and the way I learned about it and why I grow no-till is because I knew nothing about growing food my mom was selling tea at a farmers market in Scarborough Maine which is the town where I'm from and I grew up there and she said well there's this new farmer in town and you should follow him on Instagram and his name is Daniel Mays and he runs Frith Farm so I followed him on Instagram and he was promoting these no-till methods of growing food so basically they don't use a tractor or anything or I don't use a tractor I don't own a tiller or tractor but I might own a tractor soon just to use to make compost and move it basically I don't want it for working in the field so anyways this guy was promoting these no-till methods of growing food where he was using big giant tarps to tarp the ground and that's how I killed the pasture here or the backyard the grass I just tarped it the first time I put a tarp down it was in October and then it it gets cold so the heat is what really kills it but even doing it that time of year I just left the tarp they're all winter I'm in Knoxville Tennessee zone 7 we have relatively mild winters typically but it can get really cold so when I pulled the tarp back in the middle of the winter the grass was mostly dead with some like weeds growing out so I dug those little weeds growing out up with a fork it was mostly onion grass and I don't know the other kind what it's called I'll show you it's this stuff this is like the worst weed that I have I think it's called bermuda grass maybe or something I could be completely wrong I don't know but it's like that rhizomus stuff that sucks so the silage tarps don't kill that I mean I had it tarped for like a year so the whole garden whenever I find that I go in with a fork and I dug it out so then I'd build the beds I'd get like a pickup truck load full of compost and I measure out 30 inch beds and 14 inch walkways and tie it up with a string from one end to the other while I measure it out and build the beds like that and then I covered them still with a silage tarp to just kill any more weeds that are going to grow up so then that spring I peeled back the silage tarp and I moved it over to the next part of the yard and I started killing that part and all this while I have a full-time job so I'm doing this on the weekends basically and then the next part of the garden just stays tarped for about a year well then I built those beds in the same method but then I just cover crop the whole thing immediately to winter rye grass in like October of that year so then the following spring the rye grass is about six feet tall I crimped it using a pallet I just like threw a pallet on top of it that matted it down I dragged the silage tarp back over it for about two weeks because now it's like April May starting to get hot in Tennessee so it cooks that up pretty quickly and just leaves a flat grass mat and then this next plot that I have the footage of that's this year after I built this market garden and I had a ton going on I'm super busy I'm like well I still have all this yard so I just pulled the tarp over there and I just let the tarp sit there for a year then the grass is just completely dead then it was mid-October I was already planning to do this obviously I planned this whole thing it's two years planning you can't just wake up one morning and say hey I'm gonna use this method on this YouTube video that I saw today like yeah you need to plan ahead so I planned two years in advance had the tarp sitting there for a year I pull that tarp back and it's just red clay basically and it starts pouring rain out and I got a five gallon bucket filled with rye grass seed and I just go out there in a rainstorm and I just start shaking rye grass seed I put 40 pounds of rye grass seed right on top of the soil I just broadcasted it well sure enough the rye grass sprouted and the rye grass grew up this tall and I crimped it and I built beds right on top of it and the wood chips so it's just like a flat sheet of mulch but the roots are still in the ground feeding the microorganisms they have a symbiotic relationship with the plants that I planted now into that garden then I layered the compost in 30 inch beds about six to eight inches deep right on top of that and then I built walkways out of wood chips right on top of that okay so it's been pouring rain out for the last two days I don't really know if that's good or bad to do this but my thought of doing it while it's soaking wet is because I'm gonna crimp this down and then pull the silage tarps over it to kill it and then it's gonna be like a mulch grown in place the roots are still gonna be attached and when I peel that tarp back it's just gonna be like straw everywhere basically like a big mat of straw and then I'm gonna plant right into that so I'm gonna go like around the edges and crimp the edges in first and then I'm gonna go and crimp it all and all facing one direction so I can just pull the tarp over it so I'm gonna go down to one end and back and then down and back and I'll speed that up while I do it this is my tool basically right just hangs by string I'm just gonna go up and crimp it down and just keep going like that to crimp it all the way to the ground and that's the first step like I'm getting off watch thețiap and I can put in the numerator and I'll try to break down one end and that's the first step and then keep buccasına and then then in place theetti gas side is at the final end and then it also, I'm gonna go we gonna go up and hit the tabs so we can combine and stop themes getting
