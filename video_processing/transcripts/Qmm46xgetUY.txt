 Music Liam, did you make a friend? Yes. You tried to let him go and what happened? He jumped right on me. You held out your hand and he jumped right in it, didn't he? Yes! And then he jumped up your leg? Yes! Liam sat him down and said, You're free to go in the wild. And he jumped right into his hand. He says, I'll hang out with you for a little bit longer. My jumping friend. He says, I saw you jumping and you're a pro. Good jumpers. You're going to trip. You're going to trip over the walnuts. I already picked up all the walnuts in this area. And there's just as many fallen again. All right, put them in. Put them in the wagon. Pick them up. You're not going to help me, are you? You're watching those cows eat? Mmm. They're so cute. Who wouldn't want to watch cows eat? They're so cool. Look who's coming. Look behind you. Look who's coming. It's baby Bowser. Bowser! Are you coming to see us? No. He turned around. You want to see the cows. You love your cows. They're sweet. Bowser, you are coming. You are coming. You are coming. You are coming. Look behind you. Look who's coming. Look behind you. Look who's coming. It's baby Bowser. Bowser! Are you coming to see us? No. He turned around. You want to see the cows. He he he he he. You love your cows. They're sweet. He he he he. Bowser, you are so fat. Haha, mama, you are looking good too. I think we're feeding them maybe a little too much. I'd rather have them a little bit hefty going into winter though. Oh that's not on his. Ayo! Oh! It's feeling so good! Thank you, Mama! Mmm! Pig snacks! Got a bunch of starting to rot pumpkins that we gotta go ahead and hurry up and feed them all before they get too gross. How's it? What are you doing? Is that just the right spot to itch? Pigs are fun! Got some pumpkins and some walnuts. We're gonna see if they like. You think you like them peaches? What are you doing? You wanna give some to the pigs? You wanna give some to the pigs? So I've had a lot of people tell me that pigs love black walnuts. I've been a little afraid to give them to them because I know that too much black walnut can be toxic. Mama! Say, will she eat them? I noticed that the boys had some black walnuts above them that were falling into their pen and they weren't eating them. So... Yeah, not sure about this. Fans, Fans, it appears. Oh, maybe they are. Nope. Nope. I already know the boys aren't eating them. Strange. I know she does like. There's some pumpkins. Bowser's like, I like pumpkins. There she goes. Chomp, chomp, chomp. These little mini pumpkins are not the tastiest but they're still... It's still food. Meow meow! Meow! Meow! He pet me! Is that a pen sword? I see you on the solar... Charger over here. Interesting side note. The chickens are interested in the walnuts. And I think that's because of the whole maggots. Or whole worms is a nicer way to call it. There's little bugs that parasitize the outer hell of the walnuts. The chickens are probably interested in that. Attracted by that. Chickens are great to clean up after other animals. Aren't they? No, Basil is eating walnuts. I don't know if his jaw is strong enough to bite through the shell. I don't know if his jaw is strong enough to bite through the shell. Oh. I don't know if his jaw is strong enough to bite through the shell. I don't know if his jaw is strong enough Come on cows! Come on cows! Come on cows! Lashes, friendship, come on! I need you out of here now. Gotta get it set up for the piggies. Come on! Come on cows! Here I'll watch the gate. Gotta watch the gate because Bill's gonna try to sneak out. We want to keep him in there if possible. Even though we know we can catch him again. Come on cows! Come on cows! Come on friendship! Come on cows! Come on lashes! There they go. Come on cows! Good girls! Good girls! Good girls! They're like ooh yeah! That grass had a chance to grow up for us. That was a good nice little short rest for this pasture. Now that the season is slowing down on the growth rate. Alright! So now we're gonna take down this fence around the coonies. We're gonna move it up into here. Give them a section right here to rotationally graze. Ryan's taking it down. We pretty much trust that Bowser and Peaches will stay with us. So we're not worried about them going anywhere while we move the fence. Should be pretty easy to get them where we want them to go. Should be pretty easy to get them where we want them to go. Peaches is like not even aware that there's no more fence. She's just chilling. She's like this is my area. I'm gonna lay down. She's such a chill little pig. Big pig. Alright! We've got the electric net fence set up. We're gonna use the solar charger all by itself on one fence so that it's strong enough. They've got the tarped area for shelter from the rain. We'll build another pallet shelter for them up here for the winter. Once it starts to get cold they'll have that. We've got the fence down right here. Our water is gonna go right here and wallow will be in this corner. But we're gonna bring Peaches and Bowser in this way. Pretty cool! We spent all that time putting up the fence over here. Peaches hasn't moved. She has no idea that there is not a fence around her. You have no clue do you? Hi mama! What are you just saying? What are you just saying? What are you just saying? What are you just saying? Thisår you want you from the family and Bundes吗? Who are a farm? Come on she's coming here. Where are you here? Here waiter comes your house! How interactions are you? Poor seventeen Sage. When there is no reason whyometer is not, you're just talking about water and water. Sk 무�üm Beverley is also talking about water. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on, Pages! You're supposed to follow him! She scared the dog. This egg bread is one of the staples of life. Use bread to catch fish. Use bread to make sandwiches. Now, I'm using bread to lure pigs. Lure pigs. Sacrificing our kids' lunch. What's wrong? Why are you afraid to go past? Come on, girl! So close! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! Critical turning point! C'mon! C'mon! Critical turning point! Come on! Push that gate close, Daddy! Push that gate close! Push that gate close! Ha ha! Now Burma's points! Alright, we got her in the paddock. If I can get her into the electric net fence without her getting spooked by walking over a fence, that'd be great. Slightly bigger pieces. Oh, I know. Over here! All of the breadcrumbs. Here we go, here we go, here we go. We'll hold up right here and then I'm going to come over the top of her. If I can get her... We still have half a loaf of bread left for us to eat! That was a full loaf when we started! Oh my goodness! Pigs! Pigs! Bill and Peaches and Bowser united. Reunited and it feels so good! Feels so good! You're so good! Now I just gotta hook up the electricity. And now the doghouse goes back to its original use. Move Titus over here so that the cows can use the original use of that shelter which was for cows. So the cows have a shelter. The dog has a shelter. And we will be building a pallet wall and ceiling for these guys shortly. They're fighting over a pumpkin. Bill is running around with a little mini pumpkin in his mouth. Bill is running around with a little mini pumpkin. You like those pumpkins? They're yummy, huh? So we have Lashes back in the buck pen. She's just in there in the buck shelter eating some of his hay. And she's in here again because she got out again. She found a new spot. And she broke through a new area. So... Man! I just wish we could just fence the entire backside of the property with regular fence instead of barbed wire. It's just not in the budget or the time limits that we have right now. So... She is in time out pen. Meanwhile, the Coonies are loving their area. They're doing a good job. And staying in. They have a couple of ducks in there visiting them right now. Mama friendship. Mama friendship. Is out there. She doesn't go far when her baby's in here. She doesn't go in the woods. She stays nice and close. But the Cooney Cooney rotational fence is up and functioning. So that was a good thing for us to be able to accomplish this weekend. Right, Bill? I hope that we will get the right to go. That's the right. That's the right. We'll see you later. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Closes catapultures delete a video description Thank you.
