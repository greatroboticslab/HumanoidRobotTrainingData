 All right time for another little video showing you some of my issues with the 750 grain drill. Normally when I put the the main seeding rate on I can have no problems but when it comes to cover crops where there's a small amount of seeds per acre going down in terms of weight I have to really adjust these seed cups which are this width here on the row which will go in and out depending on how I move this lever and when it gets too narrow the seeds start to pile up and they don't flow easily so gear what deer does they sell a kit half speed gears which is consists of two gears and crucially for for my purposes the part number changes by serial number and I bought this set which one of the two gears is fine for my serial number but apparently I needed this gear $300 which you can see there's a hole there I don't know if it's gonna show up but a roll pin goes through that where it slips on the shaft this gear is in place of that spur gear and then we're gonna go over here I'll show you the issue that gear the larger gear goes on top on the left and then the smaller gear that I just showed you goes on in place of this one down here and the issue becomes trying to get that gear on and off there's a roll pin that goes through it and you've got to be able to knock it sideways to get at that shaft because the shaft comes through right here on the end and the roll pin goes through that shaft so the roll pins perpendicular to the shaft the issue is how do I get a punch in there to deal with that and then the other issue was if you can see but I modified this cover see a little tab I welded there normally this sits right down in here but in order to get that gear out this one you've pulled straight out it won't come out because the space between this shaft and the side was so small you can't get the gear out without cutting this so this is all by way of saying this was the difficulty I faced when trying to switch right before I planted and drilled the cover crop had no problems with the wheat with the normal size gearing but when I wanted to try to use the smaller gears not only did I have the wrong part but to put that part on and off just be I want to say a nightmare but trying to get in there and then you have to get new roll pins every time and you're pounding on it and there's got to be a better way so that's what I'm trying to come up with some kind of little press to press that roll pin out in order to go to the smaller gear the different gear when I have to really dial the rate down and essentially what this these half speed gears do instead of having let's say a half inch slit or a quarter inch slit in this seed cup you could you could double that size that width of that seed cup because the gears are only turning at half the speed it lets you flow flow a little bit better and you get more sensitive because I was down here on this scale at like seven or eight when it goes up to 60 and it's not very sensitive there's a lot of slop in it and and it's just very very it was a challenge so I'm hoping this video kind of makes sense but it's something I want to work on in addition there's various wear parts on this drill that are going to need replacing the gauge wheels the openers the seed openers there's various parts with the seed boots that need to be replaced as well and and that'll all happen at this point next spring before we use it to drill the peas so thanks for watching try not to get too jerky here but it's a really good drill it's worked well for me but it just it just needs some attention to work even better thanks for watching and we will see on the next one bye
