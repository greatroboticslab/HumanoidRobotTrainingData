 Music Whether you contact your local extension office for a problem in your yard or garden, or you're working with a new landscaper on a landscape project, one of the first recommendations is going to be to have a soil test done. Once you've taken the samples, they'll send back a description of what they find in those soil tests. Those soil tests will give you your basic pH, the electrical conductivity, whether you have lime in your soil, soil texture, and give you some basic information about nutrients and organic matter. One of the things that your soil test will tell you is that you have high salts or electrical conductivity in your soil, and in Wyoming, most of our pH tends to be high in the alkaline range. The organic matter is something that you do have a lot of control in, and if your organic matter is low, we would recommend that you use compost, manure, anything that was plant material to amend your soil, and then it will give you information on the nutrient levels in your soil. Nitrate is really important for plant growth. Phosphorus is important for root growth. Potassium is going to be really important for the overall health of the plants in your garden. If you need help in determining what those soil sample results mean, you can have a copy sent to your local extension office for details on your soil sample.
