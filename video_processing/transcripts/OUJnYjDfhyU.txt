Where do they fit into the system, the overall system? Often here, people just come to me and they say, oh, grain bags, they're cheap, right? Are they any good? Well, to me, yes, they do have a place in the system. And yes, they have a low capital cost. They tend to have a bit higher maintenance and a bit higher labour requirement, as you'd expect, the obvious. And to me, they're really well suited to the shorter term storage. So if you're thinking about the higher volume, lower value sort of commodities, ideal for those things like harvest logistics. And ideally, really limit them to dry grain. You don't want to go storing over moisture grain in bags because we don't have a way to aerate them efficiently. With bags, it's really about, from the experience I see around the place and the experience people tell me about, it's really about the effort you put in. If you don't put much effort in, don't expect a great result. If you put the effort in, then you can make them work very well and you can expect to store them for a bit longer. Obviously, if you imagine a graph of time and risk, the longer the bag is down, the higher the risk becomes of something going wrong, that bag degrading, the higher the risk becomes of something going wrong. So ideally, short term, harvest logistics is a really good spot for them. Those big years where you've got a high volume of grain that you've got to hold, but not anticipating to hold it for too long. So, you've got to be able to get a high volume of grain that you've got to hold, but not seeing the amount of grain that you've got to hold. Site selection preparation really is key. You see occasionally the bag, one bag in the corner of each paddock. And unfortunately, they're the typical scenarios where I see people have issues. One, because it's not the best site and it's not managed as well as it could be. So, sites are actually really important. So ideally, we have a central site or even a few central sites around the farm that allow us to have all weather access to that site. And somewhere that we're going to be driving past regularly. So, at least weekly, we need to be checking the bags and patching in holes, dealing with any permanent issues, things like that. So, a central site, there are several central sites around the farm where all your bags are stored. In the same way that you set up your silos, you put them all at a central spot so that they're much easier to monitor and manage. And therefore, you're more likely to do it. Obvious ones, high ground, ideally with a slight slope. So, and you can see in the picture here, we've got a bag which is on a bit of a rise, which is great. The only thing I'd do if I was doing the bag would be to start at the top of the slope and run the bag down the hill. Again, just to help with water drain, make sure it runs down the hill away from the bag. And depending on what sort of seal mechanism you use at the end of the bag, probably better to have it the other way than any of the recommendations that I've used. Obviously, if you put it across a slope, the water's going to run down the hill and tend to pull it against the edge of the bag, which is not going to be. So, down in the middle of the slope is ideal. Compacted surface, I've got written there. You've got a nice graded surface in this picture. What I have seen plenty of times is when the rain comes and falls on the bag, runs around the side, pulls beside the bag a little bit quickly if you don't have a slope. And that'll soften the ground underneath the bag. And then the weight of the bag will actually make it sink into the soil. And so, what you end up with the bag, it might be a little way under the ground, actually sinks into the ground. And so, if there is a hole under there, if mice dig in underneath and catch you a hole, you bring that with the grain bag sitting in a little pool of water. So, impacted surface so that the bag sits nice and firm and on top of the ground, the water really runs away. And it also stops water pouring at the side here and in the heap of grass, growing on the soil. Obviously, free of sticks and sharp rocks, goes without saying. People have told me to keep them away from trees where birds nest. Obviously, birds are a bit of an issue with bags. So, having a site that's away from where birds nest is another obvious one, but something that I hadn't thought about until someone told me. They've got to keep that value of it. Another one, I've got a good credit to the people that do bags. They've passed on a lot of their tips and tricks of what's worked and what hasn't. But away from sand hills and long grass where rabbits and foxes tend to live. Obviously, rabbits are not a huge issue for bags. But what chases the rabbits is foxes and foxes running over the top of the bag are a bit of an issue. They can make holes. So, keeping them away from those sand hills and long grass where they're in shelter. Setting up and filling the bag. First step, I suppose, is to select the quality bag. And that can be one of the most helpful tips someone gave me was actually just do the thumb test. In the photo here, I've got a demonstration what I mean by thumb test. Giving it a sample of a bag or a corner bag and just kind of stick your thumb to it. So, to see how hard or how easy it is to actually punch in a bag. They have improved since they first come to Australia. The quality of bags are seeing now is much better than it started out the week. Something to just be aware of. I don't say much anymore. People selling silage bags, grain bags, and they're just not the same. They're not the same quality. So, keep an eye out for that. A bag with a stretch marker on it also makes life easier. They often come with a ruler. So, you just measure up here to get that ideal stretch that the manufacturer recommends. Things like that can make it easier when you're trying to fill a bag. I don't have any research on this, but people have said they sprinkle a little bit of your ear on the ground before laying a bag to deter the mice. Again, I don't have any research around how that works or why that works. But anecdotal leaf there will tell me that it can go itself. I'll put that one in there as well. Sealing the starting end of a bag is quite important. You might have seen or might have used the real easy method of bunching the bag up, putting a tablet around it and stuffing it underneath itself. It really is not the best option for a few reasons. One of the main ones is when you come to enter the bag, the square of the starting end, the less shoveling you have to do. And I don't know if I really enjoy shoveling. So whatever we can do to make that job easier, the better. So starting with a nice square end, whether you use the dedicated seal or a couple of bits of timber, clamp together and then roll it under each other. Roll it under itself. Trying to get a good seal and a square end is helpful. Obviously when you're filling, you want to get the correct stretch. And I'm going to overfill a bag. Be aware if you haven't used bags before that they will stretch a lot more when it's warmer. They'll stretch a lot easier. So be aware of that. Filling a bag on a cool day versus filling a bag on a hot day will be a little bit different. So I think the stretch will be easier. So be careful not to overfill them, particularly in a hot day. I've got straight there. Some people might think that's a little bit picky and a little bit finicky that we need the bag straight. There's a couple of reasons for that though. One is that it's a lot easier when it comes to outloading if you've got a straight bag to follow. That's the first obvious one. The other one is, you've seen the photo here. We've got a couple of creases forming in the bag. Every time the bag changes direction, it'll cause a crease. And those creases we find are where mice are most likely to attack because they can chew the bag quite easily. So the straighter we get it, the less creases, the less spots we've got for mice to access. And down here, like I said before, I do even know that. Well, we'll look at this photo. You can see the site here. It's obviously just in the corner of the paddock. Again, not my preference. I understand it's very convenient for harvest logistics to run it straight from the chase and get into the bag in the corner of the paddock. But again, it's not ideal and really limits the time that I would be comfortable leaving the bag, leaving the grain stored in the bag. So if it's just half of logistics for a month and we want to take the risk on being able to upload it when it's dry and not too wet, then that might be okay. But just be aware, if you're putting a bag in the corner of the paddock, you don't want to let it get too long or you do start increasing. After filling, obviously, we've got to seal up the end of the bag where we're finished. Again, I would go to a bit of effort here. You can get proper heat seals just to seal that up properly to keep the moisture out. It seems like a pretty simple thing, but a lot of people tell me that moisture will find its way in there if it's not done properly. So it really is worth going the effort. Again, clamp the two bits of timber together on the other side of the bag, roll it under itself, and then put some dirt on top of it. Hold that end down, that open end down with some dirt. Obviously, you've got to leave some bag excess there to get the unloader started. So some dirt on the top will stop that flacking around and tearing and degrading the bag. Seal that in. Fence off the side, of course. Even if we don't have sheep on our farm, there's always a story of the neighbour's sheep got out and ran over the top of my bag or some wild goats or something, or wild pigs, got in it and made a mess. So I'd recommend to fence any site regardless of whether you've got livestock or not, there's always something that a fence will deter. Baiting for mice, you can do a pretty simple bait station to bait for mice. And cleaning up any spills that might have happened around the site, you can see on the left-hand side here, we've got a beautiful hard compacted site here that makes it really easy to clean up grain spills. And the reason for that is to remove a reason for both grain pests and vermin, mice, birds, anything like that, to be actually attracted to the bag, to be attracted to the site. So if we clean those spills up and remove them from the site completely, we remove the temptation and the attraction for animals to get there. Same as when we're patching the bags, when we're going around monitoring and patching them, that's about stopping that attraction, stopping them spilling ground out and stopping them from attracting vermin in. The photo on the right here, we've got a nice simple fence around it to stop a vermin. A couple of things I don't like though is they've left the grass grow around the bag, which again is a shelter there for mice or insects, which is not ideal. And you can see that they've got it right beside a beautiful fresh tree line, which might be convenient in the core of a paddock. But it's just providing food for those birds that nest in the trees, which is an ideal. Bring to the monitoring I've already touched on. We hear weekly is the ideal for the patching bags. Again, depending on where they are and how much pressure they are under from vermin. I've had a couple of people tell me they have to go around them every couple of days to patch them. Again, as soon as you've got a hole, you've got a spot for grain to get out. That becomes an attraction for more vermin. That also is a spot where moisture can get in. So as soon as you've got moisture coming into a bag, you're much more likely to have grain damage, of course, but also provides a really nice spot for insects to start breeding more moist grain. It is the ideal spot for insects. So it is important to patch those bags nice and quickly. It'd be good to be able to sample the bag, check for moisture, temperature, insect pests. I haven't seen a great system for sampling, but I'm sure you guys have got them. I'm sure you guys have got a system to monitor the grain, but in the same way we monitor grain in bags as well. Obviously, if we have big rainfall events, we want to drain the water away, stop the growing weeds around the bag, stop pulling the water and those sorts of things, keep the water drained away, and obviously come back and have more basic needs. And again, I'll put this picture in to demonstrate they've got the bag nice and straight, which is making unloading easy. You can see there's not too many holes. It's likely here that they've not put the bag down for too long. So while it's in a paddock and right beside some trees, they're doing the right thing and they're not letting it there too long and expecting to go to store the grain for a great time, probably only a month. A few quick pros and cons of bags. Certainly low capital cost up front. They do allow good segregation, flexible capacity, flexible in location. If you're leasing ground or you've got a farm that's a distance from the home place and it's not convenient to cart grain home, you could put a set up a bag inside there. So flexible in location. The cons or the things to be aware of, they will require a bit more labor. It takes two people to load a bag and ideally a couple of people to fill them successfully. You could probably take shortcuts, but again, every shortcut you take really reduces how good a job you're going to do and therefore how long you can store the grain successfully in the bag. At the moment we don't know of a successful way to aerate the grain in bags. We lend ourselves to not be able to do the aeration cooling. I wish that there's some risk with damage and loss with a bag. I think all the things I'm telling you here is to try and minimize that risk and limited storage period. Look, people tell me they've stored in bags really comfortably for up to 12 months, but they're the people that have done everything by absolutely ideal as they can. If you're going to take shortcuts or perhaps it's not an ideal situation, then you're really talking about a three month storage ideally. The longer the store, the higher risks. Quick summary on bags there. Let's have a quick look at bunkers while we're going on temporary storage. Very similar to bags in the site selection. We want somewhere high. We want good drainage to keep the moisture away. A compacted pad again for the same reasons as we do with bags. We don't want the weight of the grain forcing a little depression in the soil and then creating a spot for water to cool underneath the pad or the bunker. A graded slope. So if you imagine a roadway, we actually want a graded camber across the pad area and then we want to actually slope down so the water runs out of that bunker area as well. So the camber and the slope as well. So it really is worth building a good site for a bunker. I've heard people say part of their site selection for a bunker if they've got really flat ground is actually where they've got access to some film to do the earthworks. You can actually add a bit of dirt in there to create the camber of the soil without digging into the ground or creating a channel around the outside of the bunker. And bunker walls look doesn't always, you don't have to have a wall around the bunker. It certainly increases your capacity and it can help with sealing the tarp down a bit better and holding the tarp, having something to clamp it to. Concrete walls are obviously ideal as a good clamping system, but there's all sorts of options there for walls. What I wouldn't recommend is using hay or straw as a wall, purely because insects, growing pests, will live in that hay and straw and infest your bunker quite readily. Calculating bunker capacity. There's a few ways to go about it. I put this table in here if people are interested. They can jump on the website afterwards and look it up from the storedgrane.com.au website or of course this webinar will be recorded so you could possibly pause the webinar and have a look at that. But give you an idea, start with how high your auger is. You're going to stack the grains. So if you've got an auger that can reach up four meters, expect your hump about, this is in wheat, expect your bunker to be about 17 meters wide, given the angle of repose for wheat. If you just did a cone, you'd be looking at about 225 tonne capacity. As an example, if you went 30 meters long, you'd be fitting 570 tonne of wheat or 760 cubic meters in that particular size. So really handy little table there to figure out the capacity of a bunker. The other way to do it, of course, is to calculate it for yourself. You can get your angle of repose for the various grains here. A grain coefficient is a calculation here, which you can do and then add into that. That will obviously give you your volume in cubic meters and then you convert that to your conversion factor, whether you're storing wheat or barley or whatever you might be putting in the bunker there. Give you an idea of how big a pad you need to grade, how far apart you need to put your bunker walls. If you want to put your bunker in the bunker, you can use a bunker operation. I would always recommend a bottom tarp. I have heard people say that they use the top tarp for a few years and then that becomes a bottom tarp in years to come. So you can do that or you can do separate a lighter quality tarp for the bottom. The top tarp, there are quite significant differences in the quality of tarp that you can get. So again, if you're looking at bunker for more than short term storage, the quality tarp really will make a big difference. And having a way to seal it down, this is an ideal method to be able to clamp the tarp down to that concrete bunker wall is a really nice method there. Obviously, if we're going to do a bunker, we'll need a method for removing the tarp. Depending on the conditions, if there's a bit of breeze, it can be quite dangerous. People have been seriously injured. Trying to remove tarps or put tarps on on bunkers when it's windy. So having a safe way, running loaders and that sort of stuff that you can move the tarps without having to manhandle them really is a good idea. And of course, an outloading method, it goes without saying whether you're a telehandler or a loader or an auger or something like that. But having a method to outload it obviously will help you out. Bunker operation, here's a couple of other methods. If you put an earth wall, might be a temporary sort of bunker. You can put an earth wall there. The ground sheet obviously wants to come up and right over the top of that wall. And then your top tarp will come down and join it. Now I do see, I think I've got in the next slide. Yes, I have people putting a bit of dirt around the bottom of the tarp here to hold the tarp down. Good in theory, but it can cause water to pool on top of that little line there. So another method is to actually dig a trench around just outside of the bunker, the tarp to go down and through and then put the soil into that little trench. So the water running down the bunker tarp will run straight across the top and away from the bunker site. Again, a bit more work, a bit more effort, but you extend the likely time that you can store grain there without having an issue. And again, these operational things are very similar to bags. We can clean up any spills, remove the grain from the site, remove the attraction, fence the site off, bait the mikes, ensure the tarp is held down. So it doesn't have things to do. Pretty common stuff. Pros and cons of bunkers, low cost of capital up front, flexible capacity, flexible location, obviously requires a bit more labour. So if labour is something you can get at harvest time, then that's fine. If labour is a real pressure for you at harvest time, then bags and bunkers may not fit with your system. Grain quality, question was, aeration, it is possible in a bunker, but it is a bit of work and a bit of setup. So I don't see it done that commonly, but it is possible. Risks of damage and loss, again, is there because it's not a permanent storage and the work required for successful fumigation. Not impossible, but does require a failure. So we have a look at the big picture of managing grain storage overall and thinking back to that first slide of where the bags and bunkers fit into a grain storage system. We've really got three categories that I think about in pest prevention, what do we do to try and stop pests getting in, pest control, what do we do if we do get pests and how we manage grain quality. So if we look at those in relation to bags and bunkers, hygiene, and structural treatments in terms of cleaning up around the site, cleaning up any loading or unloading gear, we can do that. We can use our diatomation reserve and clean up as well, so that's good. Aeration cooling, I'll put a cross against that one. While you can do it in bunkers, I don't see it done very commonly because it is so much work to set up and manage. So I'll put a cross against that one. Protectants, look, this is where they do have a place in that temperature up storage and shorter term. I'll put a question mark there because I don't know of anyone that has actually set up a chaser bin or something to be able to apply protectants. At the required rate, it does seem to be a little challenge to be able to get an even consistent flow of grain and calibrate that to protect the application. So certainly it will be possible, I just don't see it that often. So yeah, don't put a question mark against that one, but protectants would help of course. And monitoring, absolutely you can do it. I've got a question mark there because so many people I see don't do it or they haven't found a way that it's built conveniently and easily, so they do build their gears. But I know you can and I know it will be different and benefits to good monitoring. Even if we do all that, we do get pests or our options to control them. Phosphine is our only control method on farm now. The alternative is a commercial fumigate, and we have a more controlled atmosphere. In bags and bunkers, it is possible there's research been done in both and it is possible to fumigate. It is a bit extra work, there's quite a process to it. One of the real challenges to fumigating in bags is actually venting. Getting the phosphine back out of a bag does take a bit of effort. You've actually got to start off a fan and it can suck the phosphine out. And it will take longer to get it out of a really long bag than it would for a silo. There is more information I'll show you about just shortly. Grain quality, again, grain quality is really about moisture and temperature management, which we don't have a lot of options in bags and bunkers. So it really relies on us putting the grain into those temporary storages at the right conditions, so that quality will be maintained because we don't have much control over maintaining quality in those temporary storage. To sum up, before I get into these, I see a couple of questions coming in, which is fantastic, so keep on coming in. Let's say be prepared to put in the work to get a good result. It would be unfair to talk to someone about using bags and bunkers and they tell you that they can store it for a long period of time successfully and then you go home and do a shortcut job or a not a good quality as you set up and then complain that you didn't have the same results. It's pretty common sense there. Put the work in and you get the results. Be realistic about your expectations for storage in bags and bunkers. Obviously, they do have their limitations, but they do have their spots. So being able to utilize them, they often work really nicely in conjunction with some permanent storage. So you can have a combination of both. If you want to outload a bag or you get an issue and you've got to outload one, to have some permanent storage outloaded into. So you might put a bag in a paddock and then after a month you've got some silo space freed up. You can transfer the grain from the paddock into permanent storage. You can fumigate there if you need to, but having some flexibility really does work quite well. As with my things on the farm, plan ahead. Do your preparation, figure out your pest control method and figure out your outloading method and to make sure you can outload in any weather conditions. For more information here, the storedgrain.com.au website or you can contact your nearest grain storage specialist on 1800 Weedling. You can shoot me an email at mico at storedgrain.com.au. Some links here, you can click on the links there, successful storage and grain bags. There's a fact sheet, there's a few other information resources there for bags and bunkers. If you go to the website and just search bunker, you'll come up with a few resources there. A few videos which are really quite handy. One from a grower's perspective, has been using bags for a while. So I encourage you to use those as well. I've got a couple of questions here. I encourage you to keep typing these questions in and I'll try and tackle them one at a time. Question here, would you fumigate a bag? Look, as I said, it is possible. It is a bit more work to fumigate in a bag. You need to set up a system that you can actually put the tablets into the bag about every seven meters so they can liberate and then to be able to remove the tablets after the fumigation period. Obviously, it relies on the bag being sealed completely. So the quality of the bag, the how good a job you've done in actually fixing up any hole with silastic or tape will determine how good a result you get. Because we can't do a pressure test on bags or bunkers, in an ideal world, we'd have gas monitoring equipment to actually tell us whether we're reaching the required 200 to 300 parts per million for a seven to 10 days to really know that we're getting a good result. Then, as I said, the venting is actually one of the tricky parts of fumigating the bag. So it's actually a matter of having a little fan, getting some perforated tube with a thread on it or like an auger flight. You can actually screw into the starting end of the bag, open up the bag, other end of the bag where you've finished filling, and actually suck the air through the bag and suck that fumigating out before we, before we outload. So yes, it's possible. In fact, this the second link I've got here, storedgrain.com.au slash grain bag fumigation, grain bags fumigation. Philip Barrow in that video goes through the process for fumigating in the bag. So the ideal is of course a gas tight sealable storage, but that's certainly possible in bags. Another question here, more comment in bags, if you don't leave adequate labor, seller bags, in code, and OHMS with the operators with loading, you know, loading bags. Yeah, really good comment, Roy. So they do take a bit more labor. You might think you can do it on your own or, you know, do it with less people, but certainly agree with the comments there. They are a bit of an OHMS risk. If you try and do too much yourself, you'd certainly have much result to get more people. So if labor's something you're short of at harvest, they may not be your best bet. If you've got plenty of people around, then they're obviously going to be a low capital cost storage option. Are there any other questions that you guys have got? I've got a few more here that I often get asked, but please feel free to add your questions there if you think of any. What I often hear is the bags are emetically sealed, therefore low oxygen inside so insects can't live. I haven't seen any independent research to back that up. So I'm going on hearsay. My personal feeling is that if a bag was in perfect condition, it's quite possible. But reality is most bags will have some holes in them at some point to let the oxygen in. So the short answer is I'm not sure that they are emetically sealed. I certainly wouldn't want to rely on that as my only insect control. I want to do everything I can to prevent the insects, prevent the damage. And hopefully they are sealed that the oxygen is low inside, but I certainly wouldn't be relying on that as my only method of insect control. I have a question here. Have there been problems in the past when used for malt barley, which may be stored for transfer from bags for up to 15 months in total from malting? Maybe be very careful. Yeah, yeah, that is a good point. Malt barley can be a little more, let's say, sensitive to its storage, certainly in terms of moisture and temperature. We know that the lower the moisture, the lower the temperature, the better the quality of malt barley will be maintained. So again, keep your bags for your lower value, higher volume sort of product. And yeah, malt barley ideally you put it into a silo, but you can have aeration to cool the grain down quite quickly. So yeah, thanks for that question or comment. Are there any other questions or comments people have got before we finish up? While you're thinking of them, perhaps I'll just remind you the next session will be on the 12th of November at 10am and we're going to look at grain protectants. So the products you can spray on to try and prevent insects and the cereal grains. Also, please keep an eye in your email inbox for a quick 30 second survey just to provide some feedback for us. As I said, if you'd like more information at storedgrain.com.au website is a whole gamut of information there. You can email me info at storedgrain.com.au or call 1800-LEEPEN. I'll put you in touch with your nearest grain storage specialist. There's an app, GRDC storedgrain app. It also has some information and monitoring capability there. So feel free to make use of that. The other offer I'll make if you would like more information on grain storage and you've got a few people in your region, we're more than happy to come and run a little on-farm training session or workshop at your place. So feel free to contact us if that's something that you think would be helpful. If there aren't any more questions, I might bring the webinar to a close. And thank you very much for your participation and your questions. I appreciate that and hopefully see you again on the 12th of November for a look at grain protectants.
