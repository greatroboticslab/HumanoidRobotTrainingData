 Hey folks, it's Josh, Stony Ridge Farmer. Welcome to the farm vlog today. It is what I like to call golden hour. The sun is setting, the trees are beautiful, everything looks wonderful. We've got a few things we've got to tackle today. We've got to go up and check on the goats. I'm going to show you some new gear that we got for the gator. We're going to have a little bit of an unboxing. Got a big shipment in from Amazon today and I bought a bunch of goodies to put on the gator to make things a little bit easier to haul around the farm. And the last thing we're going to do, my lawnmower seems to constantly have a flat tire. So today we're going to address that problem. I've got some new inner tubes for the front wheels on my zero turn mower. We'll take the tire off the rim, slap those new tubes in there. Come on along. We'll have a little bit of fun today. First, we've got to go check on the goats. Get a little bit of work done. All right. Stony Ridge So first thing we're going to do is head up to the goat pen where I'm going to need this pitchfork. I'll show you why I need the pitchfork. I've got an issue and we're going to solve this issue probably in one of the next few vlogs. And I'll take you up there and I'll show you what the biggest issue is. It's easier if I can show you. Let's go have some fun. Guys, one thing about golden hour, golden hour doesn't last very long. The grass is really coming in nice. The sun is beautiful. Man, look at that. This is all the new ground, the new grass that we sowed this year. It's coming in nice and thick. We sowed this last September. And this is some of the debris that's fallen from the windstorm. So over the past two days here, we've had bad, bad winds. The east coast is experiencing what they call a nor'easter. And that's pushing a lot of wind, a lot of cold wind off the coast right to us. And it's knocking trees down. So we had a fire yesterday. My neighbor called me up. He said, hey man, do you know your field's on fire? I said, what? Let's feed the goats. So here's the goat feed. And here's the goats. I am getting ready to start relocating the goats in this area right here. And basically, we're going to move them from plot to plot to plot all throughout this field. Hey, goaties. So let's talk to you a little bit about the problem that I'm having up at the goat pen. I put round bales in the goat pen for the goats to eat. And this is what happens to them. They get climbed all over and they eventually just get kind of spread out, blah, all over the field, the pasture here. And they bind up the fence with it also. So this is an electric poultry net. And that's what keeps the goats in. But it doesn't work if it looks like this. Let me show you. The goats have spread out the hay all the way up against the fence, right in here, all the way down to here. So we've got to get that off. We've got to get that under control. And we've got to find a better way to feed our goats hay. They're just wasting hay. They're just wasting it. They're spreading it out on the ground, which is good for the ground. That's okay. But they're wasting hay. And I'm going to take you over here and I'll show you what my idea is. This is an old tobacco trailer used to haul tobacco. I bought it from a guy a few years back. And I built a mobile chicken coop, a egg mobile out of this thing. Well, I built the egg mobile a little bit too top heavy, and it nearly turned me and the gator over. So we had to rethink what we were doing. And we took off the chicken coop and reuse the materials when we built our chicken coop down by the garden. So my thought is to convert this to the goat mobile. The goat mobile will move about the farm with the goats, and the goats will go up inside of it. I'll feed them inside of it. So when I get ready to move them, I can just close the door and move the goats. And I also want to rig up an apparatus probably on the front here that keeps the hay bale up off the ground where the goats have to reach up and eat. That's going to make for some fun times on the Stony Ridge Farmer channel building this thing. We'll call it the goat mobile. You know, I went searching farm channels and looking for ways to feed goats that, you know, they didn't waste so much hay. And there's just not a lot of information out there. So I'm going to put some info out there for you. Guys, I hurt my finger the other day. This finger right here, not my middle finger, but my ring finger, my right hand. I think I broke it on something the other day. It kind of got twisted. Man, it's like you hear about the tiger that got a thorn in his paw. He just can't function. I just, I'm having the hardest time because I just want to work. I want to be able to throw stuff and pick stuff up. And this hand is really hindering that. It's a bummer. As you can see, it's a pain in the butt. Hopefully having the goat mobile and a place to keep the hay up off the ground will solve this problem. I won't have to get in here and do this anymore. All right, we got our chores done with the goats. We're going to ride down here to the shop, get this unboxing done and get the wheels off of this lawnmower. At least the plan is today to get the front wheels off. I think I'm going to take the back tires off and take them to the tire shop. A local tire shop here does a pretty good work and they don't charge very much. So we'll take the tires to the tire shop, have them go through, make sure they don't have any leaks. And if they do, we'll have them put patches in the inside of the tire and do it right. That way I'm not filling up tires all summer long. That's a pain in the butt. I don't know if you guys have ever experienced that. If you've ever experienced that, post me a comment. Guys, I asked you, click that like button right now. Go down there, click that like button. Tell me what you're thinking. All right. So we've been putting off this job pretty much all winter long. I bought the inner tubes last fall because I was just so sick of filling up the tires on the lawnmower. And I'll show you over here. They're probably already flat again. I just filled them up yesterday. Yeah. You can see that one there is going flat. And this one here is just, it's just mush. First thing we got to do is sweep up this area. So we get a nice clean place to work. Nobody wants to work in a big pile of dirt. Shop owner's best friend right there. So much easier to sweep up your mess. One of these little handheld jobs like that. So one bad thing about a zero turn, a large zero turn like this, this is a commercial John Deere 777. You really can't move it unless you start it. So I really hate to start an engine like this and let it run for 15 seconds and back up. It just seems to me it's doing more harm than good, but we got to get it into the middle of the shop so we can work on it. But the nice thing about having a zero turn is you can whip it around in a little bitty tight spot. Let me show you what we've got to do. The front tires on the zero turn come off a little bit different than, you know, than your normal tire. Let me show you. So what I'll have to do is jack it up from this point right here and slip a jack stand in right here. And we basically unbolt this bolt and the wheel should come right off. And you can see that tire is pretty much shot. This one, this one holds air pretty good. You know, the wheels are all kind of scrubby there. So we may do a little wheel restoration. We'll also just take this nut off and remove it and we'll put jack stands underneath here. We'll fix these first and then we'll take off the rears. So the rears have a pretty easy system. You just unbolt those four bolts and off comes the wheel and I also write down 18 PSI. So this is my piece of equipment. It's going to be my piece of equipment until it falls down, dying and screaming. It's going to go down in flames before I get rid of it. On my wheels, I wrote down what the PSI needs to be for the tires. That way I'm running the same tire pressure on all four tires and I get a good even cut. So if you're really OCD like me, sometimes having a tire that's a different pressure on one side of the lawnmower versus the other will cause your cut to be off and it'll cause you to get an uneven cut on your lawn and make your lawn look like crap. We want our lawn to look like gold. So that's why I'm so obsessed with tire pressure and getting these tires right because I check the tire pressure before I mow every time. I always check the oil and I always check the tire pressure. That way I don't make a mess. What good would all this work do if you went out and mowed your yard and it looked like crap when you got done? So we're going to use these little wimpy jack stands. We'll take our jack, get our mower up off the ground here, slide in our jack stands. May need to do a little manual manipulation here. There we go. Pop that dude loose. That sucker's in there. I'm going to have to get my rubber hammer and tap on it a little bit. Always be careful if you're hammering on some bolts or something like that, that you don't damage the threads if you're going to hammer on them. So we're going to get the rubber dead blow hammer to knock this thing out with. Dead blow. Every guy needs a dead blow hammer in his toolbox. I'll post links to all the tools that I'm using down below in the video description. If you see something in here that you're thinking about getting, there'll be a link down below. If you think you need it, it's down there. Man, a pain in the butt. Put the wrench on it. Come on out of there, buddy. Nothing's ever easy. I will now deploy the beater screwdriver. Everybody needs a good beater screwdriver. Nothing ever goes like it should. So this thing should have just slid right out. It's rusty. It's been outside. It's had grass on it. Grass is really acidic and grass is really, really hard on metal. So when I get done with my mower, I normally try to blow it off the best I can. I'll take the leaf blower and blow it off. And then once every couple of weeks, I'll take the air hose and blow it off. Try to get all that old grass off there, especially wet grass. Don't use a water hose. Just blow it off. All right, let's Buster out of here. Come on, Buster. Come on out of there. Good Lord. You're making me look bad. I'm going to knock it back and forth a couple times. See if that makes it slide out a little easier. Of course it doesn't. Good gracious. I'm going to have to use the feet. There we go. That's what daddy likes. There we go. See all that crusty rustiness? We'll clean that up before we put it back on. All right, so here's our wheel and tire assembly. It has two little grease caps on the ends right here. That one and that one. And those cover up the bearings. We'll set those to the side. And we'll look at our bearings, our wheel bearings in here, and make sure they're turning free. You can tell here this one really isn't turning that free. This one, yeah, they're both kind of gummed up. My inclination is to clean them up really good. Take the air hose and clean them up really good. Maybe put a little bit of oil in there. What I did not know is there is a metal shim down in there about that long, like a tube down inside this wheel. So I'm going to slide the bolt back in here. That's what it was all hanging up on there. So that's kind of, kind of work it back and forth here. Trying to work that rust off. Anytime you're doing a job like this, you might as well try to do it right and make sure everything's functioning properly when you put it back together. So I'm going to rub and clean on these bearings a little bit and put some white lithium grease on it. I think that's probably the right thing to do. In case you guys are wondering, the free lawnmower that I got still on the back of the $100 truck. We'll get that off in the next day or so. It's supposed to be a rainy day coming up. I want to get it off there, bring it in the shop here on a rainy day and take the engine off of it. First, we got to make sure it fires up. So we'll throw a battery on it and see if it fires up. There we go. Spinning pretty freely. They're not brand new and we don't expect them to be brand new, but they're not making any kind of grinding noises or anything. So I'm okay with that. So let me start by saying I've never done this. Here's the inner tube, the new tube, and here's the tire. This is a tubeless tire that's in it right now. And I'm really wondering how the valve stem situation is going to work out. So we're going to go on and open our tube. Hopefully this isn't beyond my scope of practice. Okay, cool. So it has a metal valve stem on the tube. And this is a Carlisle lawn and garden trailer tube. I think is what it says. Yep. Lawn and garden trailer tube. Cool. And the tire is a 13 by 6.5. Once again, I've not done this before. I have a tire removal tool basically for a mountain bike. And I'm going to try to get in here and wedge the tool in and ring it around and pull that tire back to the side. And then I'll slide the tube in and put the valve stem through. Hopefully that'll be good. I think the first step in this should be removing the valve stem. Good lord. Right now, some of you pro tire guys are laughing at me. I probably need to cut this, don't I? Yep. So we'll give it a little bit of a slice here. There's a good razor knife. That sucker's tough. It's got metal in it. So basically, you have to cock. I'll show you here. You basically have to take your valve stem and cock it over like that and then cut right in there. And that's what I'm going to do right here. And that'll get that valve stem to where I can remove it. Man, having this messed up finger makes everything a pain in the butt. Every time I bump it on something, it hurts because I'm a big wuss and that's how I roll. Good lord. That's some good rubber on there. There. There it is. That's what it looks like. We'll get rid of that. Throw him in the trash can over here. Inside the tire is now the little valve stem, okay? So we know when we pop our tire off with our tire tool, which hopefully works, we know that we've got to get that valve stem little rubber piece out of there or that's going to be a potential hazard. We're going to take the tire off the rim on the valve stem side. About need a tire changing tool to get it off. Ladies and gentlemen, this is beyond what I can do in this shop. I'm just going to pull all four wheels. This is beyond what I can do. I'm going to pull all four wheels, make sure all the bearings are okay. All the bearings are good. But this is beyond what I can do. I'm going to have to take it to the tire shop. That thing right there is really, it has a huge lip on it and it's a really, really stout tire. You know, this is a commercial mower, so it may be best that I have them put air in the tire and fix up the rim. I'd like to take the wheel all the way off, scrape it clean with a wire brush or a wire wheel and make sure it seats really well. The problem with this is that the wheel is rusting right in here and it's rusting along the edge where the tire touches it. Now, once again, my farm tractor tire store knows how to deal with this stuff and they'll hit it with a wire wheel and be done. They'll probably hit it with a little bit of primer too. It's a job for another day. That's a bummer. You know, sometimes that works out that way. Well, let's get over here and we'll set this tire and wheel down. We'll go ahead and pop off all the wheels and tires and I'll get them all cleaned up and ready to take to the tire store. Make sure not on them have any leaks and that they'll hold air. Okay. Let's get over here to the unboxing. I want to show you all the cool stuff that I got. Basically, I just bought a box of goodies that I need around the farm. I bought my favorite kind of overalls. I bought two different kinds of mounts to put on the Gator and we'll try both of those mounts. They're like a hook type mount. I'll show you in a second and we'll tell you which one's the best. So I think that's what it's all about is learning what's the best, what works, and what doesn't work. So let's show you what we got. My little friend came to help me. You my friend? Shake my hand. Good girl. Good girl. And here's what we got. This is a huge box from Amazon. We bought double rhino clips for the Gator and we'll put those on either in the next vlog or in Monday or Tuesday's vlog. We'll put these on. It's a clip designed to hold two rifles or two shovels or two whatever. I really want to start keeping a rifle like kind of a beater rifle, a 22 or something on the Gator. So in case we run across a coyote, we can take care of business. And the next thing is these coplin mounts. These are ratcheting rhino grips and we'll install these. We already have one of these on the Gator. I have been through five of these. They work really great until you bump into a tree and they don't hold up so good. Bumped into a tree. Heavy duty magnets. So I have a steel building. If you guys have a steel building, that's what this is, is a steel building, a steel structure. And in this box right here, I bought two boxes of them. There are 40 pound magnets. I'll post links to all this stuff down below. And especially once we start putting this stuff together, I'll post links on that. These are heavy duty magnet hooks and they're really heavy duty because it's hard for me to get them apart. So basically they come. Gosh almighty, things on there. Nothing's going right. All right. So this is the little magnet and it's a 40 pound magnet and it screws in to a little hook like that. And I use these all over the place here in the shop. So you can screw it in, screws in nice and tight and you stick it on your metal building. So let me show you. So I've got several types of these. This is a really, really heavy duty one. I've got some locks hanging here. This is one and I have a gate opener on it. And basically they just stick on there. Like good gracious. Let's do a comparison. So I bought this one on Amazon and I got this one at Walmart. I can whack that. I can whack that one. That one just falls off. So this is extremely stout. And if you wanted to, you could probably put a longer bolt in there. So if you've got a steel building like this, these hooks are indispensable. You need to hang stuff up, hang your keys up or whatever. These Walmart brand or whatever brand these are, these little cheapies are not so good. So tried and true. It's almost as stout as that one right there. So I'll post a link down below. Gosh, that thing is on there. They stick really, really good. They'll hang 40 pounds. A little tiny magnet. This thing's as big as a nickel and it'll hold 40 pounds. It's amazing. So the last thing that we ordered, the last few things that we ordered is what we're going to be wearing throughout the summer while we work on the farm. And that is overalls. So these are the key brand overall and the style pocket that these have in them. There's a snap pocket and another snap pocket and a place for your pin. And then I have the Liberty brand. I'll show you the difference in the Liberty brand pocket and the key brand. Guys, if you've never worn a set of bibbed overalls, you might think you look like an idiot. You might feel like an idiot for the first day or the first 15 minutes that you wear them. Once you wear these things around your farm and around your house, you'll realize how restrictive your belt is on your belly. It basically constricts you in the midsection of your body and makes you have a gut. They're really, really lightweight. So if we get tired of them being long pants, we'll cut them off and make some really sexy shorts. And this is the Liberty brand. And the Liberty brand, it has a different feel to it. It's more of a, I would say more of a country looking brand. And it has a bigger front pocket, a bigger front end. It has a zipper pocket here, which is very, very convenient. And you can put your phone in there and your phone won't get all dirty and dusty, which is very nice. And you can feel it vibrate on your chest. And it also has the snap pocket with one big pocket in there. And it also has a spot for your pin. It's kind of a toss up between the Liberty and the key. I'll tell you what I think at the end of the summer or sometime later on, whether I like the key or the Liberty better, or what I have on right here, which is a Cahart. The only problem with the Cahart that I have is this right here. This is turning into a clothing commercial. It's not what I wanted to do, but I want to tell you about things that are good and things that are bad and the problems that I run into so that maybe you can use those things and learn from me and not make those mistakes. Just like trying to take that tire off. The issue I've had with the Cahart brand is this little tab right here, this little tab, it likes to get hung up in the washing machine. And you can see that's frayed to the very end. The overalls are only as good as the clips will last. This one got hung up too, and it's all bent out of shape. You can see it's bent right there. Take it for what you will. I do like the Cahart brand. It's very robust. It's very tough. It's my winter time overall. However, these do like to get hung up in the washing machine and get twisted. So yeah, take that for what it is. Well guys, that's kind of it for the vlog today. Thanks a lot for watching. Please click that like button. Click that thumbs up. Don't forget, there's going to be a lot of good stuff to come. We're going to build the goat mobile. We've got to put all those little attachments, those little grippy attachments on the Gator, and I'll show you how they fit and how rifles and stuff fit in there and how shovels and stuff fit in there. If it's something you might want for your UTV. And we've got to get these tires off, get them to the tire store and take care of business. So I don't want to fool with flat tires and putting air in tires and carrying around a compressor and carrying around an air tank all summer long. We're going to solve this problem. Tomorrow's plan is me and Mrs. Stoney Ridge are going to move the goats or at least build the fence to move the goats to a new section of pasture. And after we move them, at some point, once it dries out, we're going to set that field on fire, burn all that broom straw and let those nutrients soak into the soil, which will make the grass pop. It'll just make it green and beautiful. Thanks a lot, guys. Click the like button. We'll see you next time. If you're not already subscribed, subscribe to the channel.
