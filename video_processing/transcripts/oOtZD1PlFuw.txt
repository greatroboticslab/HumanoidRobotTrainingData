 Three tips on growing these little prima donnas, watermelons. Number one, plant them above the ground a bit, especially if you have clay soil. Just like me, watermelons don't like wet feet. Tip two, plant like 10 in one mound, then thin those 10 to about three or four of the best ones. Tip three, give these bad boys a lot of space. Each of these vines can run about 20 feet or more, even well outside of the bed. More tips in the caption. Take a look at that.
