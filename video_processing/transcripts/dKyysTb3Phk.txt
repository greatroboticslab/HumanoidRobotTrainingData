 Music Initially, people thought that disability is a curse, but I have changed the perception of the community. Music And now they are accepting that disability is our only future range. I walk inside. I know I walk differently, so I do my things differently, but I am a person like any other person. Music My dad used to tell me to do farming, but I was not interested. I thought it was very dirty. That's why I did IT. So I wanted to do anything to do with technology, computers, behind the desktop and studying other things. Now, my IT background assists me a lot because I learn online, I market my produce. Technology has come to change what my dad used to do. And I can change family. Whatever I'm doing here, I can send it online. Instead of now taking my vegetables to the market, they are collected from home. You get your money quietly, with no disturbance. And you can go somewhere. With a goal, with a purpose, you know, that's why you find me having these pigs. Feeding them like my babies. You know, you must love whatever you are doing. Once you change the mindset and you know, you love whatever you are doing, you achieve a lot. Young people believe that Nairobi is the only place where you can make money or you can get employed. I take advantage of being next to Nairobi because most people in Nairobi feel from here. That was also another reason why I decided to do farming. For the youth now, they should also know that agribusiness is also an employment. If you excel very well in agribusiness, you can get as much as you wish to get. So you should come over and join me doing farming. Doing farming. . . . . . . . . . . . . .
