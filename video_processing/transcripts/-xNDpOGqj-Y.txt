 Hello, my name is Ashley. Today I want to teach you how to raise a chicken. Not that it's hard. I have two chickens over here, which is they are really, really beautiful animals. They are in my garden, of course. That's the easiest way to raise. You see the garden here, which is, it's really like a country garden. I'm a country girl in the middle of the city. So, the chickens, it's really good to have it. Everybody should have it because they really lay fresh eggs for you every day. Which those two chickens, they lay every day two eggs. And I let them, they have their own coops, their own place. They go at night by themselves and in the morning, if you don't like their kale coop, they come out and they wander around in the morning to eat all the insects and everything. And besides that, when they, their manure, I have to tell you that it's a very, very good fertilizer. And that's how my garden, it grows. This is special tree garden with the fruit trees. I don't put grasses. The animals, they eat the grasses and they give me back fertilizer and they give me food back again. They are very, very beautiful animals. I think everybody should have it and enjoy it. How big? And this is what they need all. It's a little grain, their food. A grain, bird seeds, whatever you put. And a dish of water over here. And you can put, you know, bird, bird bat over here. Even other birds, they can come and enjoy it and eat it. Now you have to see my garden, my fruits, whatever. Thanks to the chickens with their fertilizer, I raise them. And we eat always organic things, all kinds of fruits and vegetables. Well, thank you for watching. I hope everybody will get animals, chickens in their house, in their garden if they have. It's a wonderful thing to have it. Thank you very much for watching. Bye-bye.
