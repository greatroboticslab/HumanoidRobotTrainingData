 Let's play a game. How many potatoes do you think are grown in Ontario each year? I think you'll be amazed at the answer. First, let me give you some hints. There are 125 registered potato growers in Ontario. They grow on approximately 38,000 acres. For city folk, that's just over 150 square kilometers. A lot, right? So what do you think? 1 million pounds? 10 million pounds? Don't guess yet. Here's something else you need to know. Ontario farms grow red, white, yellow and russet potatoes. They're sold fresh through grocery and food service channels as well as through the process market. This includes potato chips and fries. Knowing this, what do you think now? 100 million pounds? 500 million pounds? Ontario potato growers produce around 800 million pounds of potatoes every year. And the majority of this crop stays here. Only a small fraction, around 5%, is exported. Get inspired to eat your fair share. Learn more about Ontario potatoes at producemadesimple.ca
