 So do you think your garden might need a little boost this spring? One of the best ways to tell is to do a soil test. A soil test will tell you what nutrients you may need in the garden and how much. The spring is the best time to do a soil test before you add any fertilizer. The tools you'll need will be a trowel, a screwdriver or a similar tool, a clean bucket, and a bag to put the sample in. A ziplock bag would be fine or a paper bag. Sometimes the soil labs will provide you a container to use. To collect a sample, you'll take the trowel and put it into the ground to loosen the soil. You'll then use the trowel to collect a thin slice of soil. The goal is to have a narrow strip of soil down the center of the trowel. So the screwdriver is a useful tool to help clean up the edges. Ideally you will sample to a depth of about six inches and you'll put that in your bucket. Then you'll repeat that step about ten times for your garden to get a good composite sample. Once you've collected your ten samples from across the garden, you will mix them thoroughly in the bucket and then you will collect about two cups of this soil into your sample bag. The lab will provide you with a form to fill out which includes the type of soil analysis that you would like to have done and what you will be growing in your garden. Your local county Extension office can help you choose a soil analysis lab and they can also help you interpret the results.
