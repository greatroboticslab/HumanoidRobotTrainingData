 Music The most common question that we receive in our extension offices across the state of Wyoming is what type and how much fertilizer should I put on my garden and landscapes? It's a question that I particularly hate because I always like to be right. Without a soil test, I really can't answer that question. In this 20 foot raised bed, I've already taken two samples and I'm going to take a third. Put it in a bucket. I'll then take that bucket and I'll mix it up really well. I, of course, have sampled the top four to six inches. I want to dry this soil out. Wet soil doesn't travel well through the mail. I'll then take a quart bag and put my sample in it. I don't want any plant material or organic material. I really just need the soil. We'll then put that sample in the mail and send it off to the lab. If you need any help with soil sampling techniques or where to send your soil, contact your local extension office. There's a really great scene in the movie Men in Black where Tommy Lee Jones has a little spoon tool and he just picks up some soil and hits a button and it tells him everything you wanted to know about the soil. I've always wanted one of those. But until I can find a store that has one, the way I get the information that my soil has, and what my plant needs are is to send it off to a lab and get that information back.
