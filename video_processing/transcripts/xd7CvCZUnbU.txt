Science & Technology
 South Dakota's educational effort to raise awareness about the importance of soil health continues. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service entered into a cooperative agreement with the South Dakota No-Till Association and iGrow South Dakota State University Extension for delivering these seminars with the latest soil health and productivity technology to South Dakota farmers and ranchers. Our next presenter, Dr. Cheryl Reese, was raised in Hancock, Minnesota. She received her undergrad and master's degrees at the University of Minnesota and her Ph.D. in agronomy from SDSU. Cheryl currently teaches soil science and agronomy production courses and advises undergraduate and graduate agronomy students at South Dakota State University. Her topic today is going to be salient and sodic soils, understanding the differences in management solutions. Cheryl. Can everybody hear me? No. Hey, wife. Thank you for inviting me to speak in Mitchell here. Today my topic is going to be a little bit different from a lot of the other topics on the agenda. We're going to hear a lot about cover crops from Dr. Peter Sexton and Dwayne, other people are going to be a little bit different from a lot of the other topics on the agenda. I'm going to talk about salient and sodic soil management. So how many people have the crops to the salt? Here. Okay? Okay, so I feel like you will have salt in the early. So, and we've done a lot of work on this. We've done work here. I've done some work on the other downwind. David Dillon by White Lake. And so I'm going to talk here. So here's my outline. I'm going to talk a little bit about the positive problem. I'm going to also talk about testing for salt. What should you look for in a soil test? I'm going to talk about sampling for salt. A little bit about how deep should you go. What do you need to look for there. And then we'll talk about some management of the house. And of course, it's going to involve some product crops. And it's also going to involve perennial practice systems as well, too. So I have quite a few slides here. I know we're running ahead of time. I won't take more time. You guys, how do you guys want to do questions? Do you? Oh, I'm not on. I'll open that up just a little bit. Okay. Is that better? Is that better? No. Can you hear me now? Yeah. Now can you hear me? Okay. So Ruth, how do you want to handle questions? At the end or did you want people to have questions during when I'm speaking? Whatever's more comfortable for you. Okay. I teach at the college, so I'm used to getting questions. So if you have questions, if you really want to, if you see something on the slide, just let me know. I'll try to watch the audience here. So let's get going here. Okay. So salt problems. We have a lot of salt problems and they seem to be getting worse every year. Especially when these spots, they, in a field, they start out small and then each year they grow a little bit bigger. All right. And so what's going on there? So we've had a lot of changes in the climate since the mid 80s. I mean, from North Dakota, you guys haven't seen the rain. Your father probably didn't see the rain that you guys have seen in the last, say, 15 years. You're kind of up in that northeastern, you know, South Dakota area by Wah Bay where we've got all this rain. A lot more rain. Okay. So we've had a lot more rain these last few years. We also, in the 70s and stuff, 80s, we did corn and soybeans. We did a lot of tillage. All right. We did a lot of tillage there. Tillage is going to destroy our soil structure. All right. So we're doing, with the tillage, we're doing something bad for the soil. We're destroying what you've seen with your water and everything. We're destroying that soil structure that allows water to go down in that soil profile. All right. The other problem is that we have salt that are indigenous to this area. Okay. When it wasn't wet, when we weren't tilling, okay, those salts were down in the soil profile, but they weren't coming up. The salts have always been deeper in the soil profile. Okay. So here, let's just take a look at South Dakota right here. I'm going to bring a pointer. Okay. So here's South Dakota right here. All right. Here's where you guys are up by Lisbon up there in North Dakota. We're all underlaying there by what we call the pure shale. All right. And there's different formations underneath here. The very top one is called the bear claw shale. It's the upper deposit of the pure shale. So we have this shale here that's below the majority of our state. Okay. Here. Here. Okay. So here we look in the upper Midwest, right up in here. All right. So this is a precipitation map right here. So here's South Dakota right here. Here's North Dakota. We can see that. And then you look at your decades here. If we look up here in the 80s and the 90s, we've had just a massive increase in precipitation. Okay. So what have we done? We've changed our cropping system from typically it would have been wheat, you know, grazing, fallow. We've done a lot more tillage and we've added, you know, corn and soybeans in there. Okay. Corn being a short, or soybeans being a short season crop. Awesome. All right. Here. Okay. Right here. Okay. So here's the pure shale. This is in Spank County right here. So this is a geologic map right here. And this is Spank County up by Redfield, South Dakota. And what they did here is they came through here and they did some sampling. This is done with the South Dakota Geological Service. And they came through here and they sampled across the county. And they came through here and they came through here and they came through here and they came through here and they came through here and they came through here and they came through here. And so what they did is they did some deep sampling here. And what they did is that each of these sites, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. They were, what type of formations do we have underneath there? All right. So that red line right down here, the KP is the pure shale. And if you look along the left-hand side here, it says elevation and heat above mean sea level. And here's the ground surface right up here. So you can see right up here on a lot of this, just across this one transect here in Spank County, we have a lot of that pure shale that's close to the surface. Well, those salts are all in that pure shale. That's where they are. Those salts are indigenous in that pure shale. Okay. And so what we do here is seasonal use of the tall grass prairie water was greater than corn and especially soybeans and wheat rotation. Okay. We also had very, very deep roots with these prairie grasses that removed the water from deeper in the soil profile. And I'll show you that here at the end, how those perennial grasses really can pump that water out. So here's what's happened, basically. We've had this abundance of precipitation in the 90s through the 2000s. We have those salts that are indigenous down there. Okay. They're not very far down. What we do is in soil. And when I teach my soil science class, we call this capillary rise. All right. So lots of soil science terms here for you guys today because I teach soil science. All right. So capillary rise right here. What happens is that groundwater comes up. It dissolves those salts from that old pure shale, the calcium, the magnesium, the gypsum, the sodium salts that are there. It dissolves those salts from that pure shale. And then what happens is, based upon what your soil texture is, based upon if you have a silky loam soil, if you have a silky loam soil, those salts become dissolved in that water down there from that groundwater. And now they start creeping up due to capillary rise. Kind of like if you look at a really thin tube or if you look at a thermometer and it has water in there, you'll see that it has a meniscus in there. So it's climbing up in the soil because it would rather be more attracted to the soil above the surface that's in the groundwater. So capillary rise occurs. It comes up against gravity. Depends upon your texture and your soil and your porosity. So a soil that has a lot of clay in it, you're not going to get water creeping up as much. A sandy soil, you're not going to get water creeping up. Okay? It's in these intermediate textured soils, like these silt loam and these types of soils, where we see that water start to creep up. The salts are dissolved in there. The water comes to the surface. It starts to warm up in the spring. The water evaporates. Where are the salts? Right. They're on your fields, right? They're right on your fields, and that's how they get there. Okay? So that's a little bit of a background about how do these areas develop. Okay. So now that we know how they develop, what can we do to manage them? Okay. How do we figure out what do we have? Okay. So now what we have to talk about is the type of salts that we have. All right? We have calcium and magnesium salts, and we have sodium salts. All right? So with these sodium salts, sodium means, just like your table salt, sodium. All right? What that means, we call that a sodic soil. Okay? We call that a sodic soil. We have the problem that plants will not grow, and the soil is dispersed. So dispersed means that you don't have that nice soil structure out there. You walk out there, and it looks like pavement. Okay? There's no, the aggregate stability is not there. All right? So that's what it looks like. This is a field up by Purpon. So you get a rainfall or something like that, and you get this. You get this. It'll start drying out. This has a high clay content. Some of it does on the surface. And nothing's going to move through here. It looks just like pavement. All right? Plants will not grow in the soil as dispersed. Okay? With saline soil, you have calcium and magnesium. Now you have plants that, well, you're doing plant problems. But usually in a saline situation with calcium and magnesium salts, usually your water will move through there. Okay? So if you have an area out in the field where you don't have any water moving through it, and nothing's growing there, if it looks like concrete, then you might want to look at testing for sodium. All right? Saline problems, typically, we do have some structure there. The problem is here is that no matter if it's a saline or sodium soil problem, we have a high water table. This is up by Purpon, South Dakota. Here, and we did some field days up by Purpon. We did some soil kits. Here, this is actually what has a buried soil horizon. But down right in here is about six feet down, and we have water down here. You can see how white that surface is there on the salts right there. So that's where the problem comes from. So what type of salts do we usually have here in South Dakota? We have typically a lot of our salts are sodium sulfate, and depending upon where you are, you may have some gypsum. We also have lime, too, as well. Okay? But typically, we're not, when we look at the solubility here, right there, we're not as worried. Lime is usually not a salt problem because of the low solubility. So what does solubility mean? Solubility means how much of that salt will dissolve in water. Okay? So what is the solubility of that salt? The salts that are really soluble are the ones that move up fast. Okay? What happens is a lot of these sodium salts down here, sodium chloride, they have a high solubility. So the higher the number here, the more soluble the salt. So the sodium will move up fast in the soil profile. It gets up to the top. It causes the soil to disperse. It seals up. Now you have a big problem. How do you get that salt out of there? Right? Like I said, typically we have these salts right here, calcium and magnesium salts, and then, of course, we have our sodium salts. Salts, but different problems and different management based upon if we have a calcium or magnesium salt, basically if we have a sodic salt there. So when you're testing and looking at your salts and your soils, you've got to define what type of salt problem do you have first. Okay? And this is what I'm talking about with this dispersion. Okay? So what's going on here? All right? So when I talk that a sodic soil is dispersed, it means that the soil, the clay particles, are pushed apart. It's pretty much equally spaced. So that soil is so evenly dispersed, there's really no porosity to that soil. There's no channels for that water to move down into that soil profile. Okay? So you can't get anything going through it. The terms that we use are flocculation versus dispersion. All right? Flocculation means that the soil is held together in aggregates, that there's pores between those individual soil pads for water to move down through it. Okay? When we have sodium, that aggregate stability is destroyed. Okay? Like I said, just some pictures here. So saline, stress, calcium, and magnesium. You guys all have seen areas like this in your field. All right? High pH, droughty conditions. It's salty. So there's salty water. Water will not move into those plant roots. We can't get anything to germinate there. Poor germination, poor growth. But if you look at this soil here, it's not great, but there's a little bit of, there's a little bit of, you can see a little bit of structure on the surface. It doesn't look like pavement. Okay? Right here, these are where we have these sodium problems right here. pH typically higher than 8.2. A lot of dispersion. No water movement anywhere. And that's soil profile. Okay? We have erosion, and we have root limitations because this soil is so dense and so hard. This is a field with a farmer that we work by, up by Pierpont, South Dakota. He's had a lot of issues with this field right here. He does do no-till. Up here in this area here, we have a kind of a little bowl area here, and he hasn't been able to get anything to grow here for quite a few years. Last May, he had about three-inch rainfall that came down, washed all this out. Remember, we have these sodic soils where we don't have any water moving in the soil profile. So what's it going to do? It's going to run off. As it goes down the slope, it's going to increase in velocity. You're going to pick up that speed. Okay? So what happens here is you have a little bowl-shaped area up here, trying to divert the water over to the ditch. Well, now we have some problems here where some junk got in the ditch there, so now it flows out over here, flows into this area right here, concentrated flow. This is looking north right there from the area where we had the bowl-shaped area. This is looking south. This big here, gully right here, was not here the previous year. Okay? So lots of problems with managing these areas. The big problem we get with these sodic soils is we have a lot of erosion problems. Okay? Okay. So like I said, just the difference between saline and sodic soils. Just to define what these are so you guys have this definition in your hand. Okay? Salts tend to help a soil flocculate. Okay? A saline soil typically does not generally become a hard set. We typically will get some water movement with that. You can see those salts go a little bit farther down. Into that soil profile we get some rainfall. So that white area will appear and disappear based upon the moisture. Okay? Based upon where the moisture, how much moisture you've had, rainfall. Okay? Water moves similarly compared to normal soils. Plants may be more negatively impacted than saline soils. Sodium soils are dead dispersed or they swell. They become hard set. They become like pavement. Water cannot move. There's a lot of huge erosion problems. It can impact fertility because of this restrictive layer, this high density, and this low fertility. Okay? So that's just a summary of what these soils are. So we're looking at, when we look at salts and soils, we need to decide, is it a calcium, magnesium salt problem, or is it a sodium problem? What is the problem? Okay. Okay. So in South Dakota, you guys all know where your, some of the saline issues are, but when we look at the sodicity here, we see that up here by Aberdeen and Spring County here, 20 to 30% of these soils have sodic horizons deeper down in the soil profile. Sodium in there. So there's a problem down here. More up here. You know, there's more coming up here. We have not as much here, but really, you know, the red and the yellow, you know, 10 to 30% of those soils in any given area have sodium deeper in the soil profile. Okay. So is there any questions on what the problems are and how they differ before I go on? Is there any questions? Okay? All right. Okay. So soil testing for salts. Some terms, I'm just going to go through this. I didn't know what my general audience would be, so I wanted to define these terms before I started talking about them. Electrical conductivity is the measure of the total salts in the soil. We add salt to water, it increases the conductivity. Same thing with soil. We can measure that in the soil testing lab. Cation exchange capacity. How many of you guys remember that? Okay. Cation exchange capacity. All right. So that's going to be the soil's ability to hold on to positively charged cations. Okay. SAR. So the sodium absorption ratio. It's a number that we calculate based upon the relative concentration of sodium to calcium and magnesium. Okay. We typically do this from something called a saturated paste. And then the other one that we've worked with, more soil testing labs use that you're probably going to see, the exchangeable sodium percent. Okay. We measure the sodium on the exchange sites from the caddy change. Typically here, I'm going to talk a lot about this right here today. Okay. In South Dakota, the reason we did this project is because we know these salty areas are getting bigger. Also, when I would teach my soil science classes, and I would get soil in from up by Pierpont, these salty soils. And I'd have my students go in there, and we test them, and we come up with these SARs that are fairly low. Okay. Five or six SARs. Okay. Five or six SARs. They are dispersed soils. We try to run water through them. They were dispersed. Nothing would work. We've always used in South Dakota these guidelines right here. All right. So we use an SAR of 13. We say if it's greater than 13, it's a soda soil. Well, I never saw that when I bring my salty soils in and have my students try to run water through them. If the SAR was five or six, that soil was dispersed. I don't get anybody to run water through it. It's like, what's wrong? Are these numbers wrong? All right. And then the ESP, the same thing. These numbers are very, very similar. So we know this is becoming a lot bigger problem in South Dakota with the saline areas. I knew from working with the soil that I get from salty areas in South Dakota for my class, it's like, what's going on here? So we wrote a grant, NRCS, and we got some money to study these areas. And so what we did is, first thing we did is, okay, we need to test, do these numbers work? These numbers of determining the cutoff values for saline, sodic, soils, were determined by the National Salinity Lab out in California. So we needed to do it for South Dakota. So these numbers here are old numbers here from South Dakota or from California. The numbers that we look at now, if our SAR is greater than four, we consider it sodic. If our ESP is greater than five, we consider it sodic. These numbers are too high for South Dakota. Okay. So just a little bit of a review of what's going on here. So cation exchange capacity, so soil science here, you know, 200. So what's happening with cation exchange capacity? Just a little bit of a review. What happens? Why do we have sodium problems? Okay. Past recommendations said that when 15% of the cation exchange sites were occupied by sodium, we classify it as a sodic soil. So cations, our clay soils here, are negatively charged due to how the formation process, the geological formation process. So we have negative charges that reside on these clay sheets here. And, of course, we have positive cations that can be occupied on these sheets. So what happens is, is when we get greater than, now in our case, we're looking at 5% in South Dakota, not 15%. We're looking at 5%. We're looking at when we get greater than 5% of these exchange sites occupied by sodium. These soils then end up just like a refrigerator magnet, right? So they're negatively charged, and we need these positively charged cations on here to neutralize that charge. And if we get calcium and magnesium, but especially calcium, we'll actually flocculate that. We'll form a bridge. Negative charge on one clay. I sell negative charge on another. Throw a calcium in there. Positive to negative. Just like a refrigerator magnet, what happens? It's together. We have aggregates, stability, form, formation. Okay? We hold that soil together. Okay? When we put sodium in there, okay, sodium has a positive charge on it, but the problem with sodium is that that positive charge is insulated. It's completely insulated. It's a small atom. You put a lot of sodium in there. You have that negative charge on those clay micelles, those clay aggregates. What happens? Nothing in there to neutralize it. So, dispersed. Okay? So, that's why we have the problems that we have. That's why we have the dispersion. Just like refrigerator magnets, we have too much sodium in there. We have repulsion. Okay. So, how do we figure this out? Right? So, how do we figure this out? What we did is we took large columns of soil and we brought them in from the field from different places it was soiled. And then what we did is we did some amendments as well. We worked for some soil amendments. I'm going to talk about that in just a minute. Okay. So, what we did here is we looked at, okay, based upon what the SAR is. So, down here it says initial soil SAR. Okay. Initial sodium concentration. So, here is five, here is 10, here is 15, and here is 20. Then what we did is we started running water through this. Okay? So, permeability, millimoles per hour, or milliliters per hour is what we looked at here. All right? So, what we saw here in South Dakota, that when we saw an SAR on these big soil columns that we brought in, we brought in there about this big around, about this deep. Our graduate student did this work on part of his PhD. And what he did here is he ran water through this, these initial ones. So, we saw slow infiltration at an SAR of greater than four. We're doing this work with Tom DeSutter. Do you know Tom DeSutter up in North Dakota? The soil science. Have you ever heard of Tom at all before or not? Any? Okay. He's doing a lot of the salt work up in South Dakota, or up in North Dakota. We did this work with Tom DeSutter. He's looking at the number he's using for North Dakota is five. So, remember, we said this used to be 13. It's way lower for our soils than 13. So, right here, considering one milliliter per hour as a threshold, the data suggests that SAR greater than four can be considered sodic. Because once we get this much sodium in the soil, we can just see how much there that our water infiltration slows down. Okay. So, that's the problem. That's the problem. And, you know, here's how we're trying to give some terminology and describe the extent of our problem with some of these soil testing values. So, in South Dakota, here, old numbers are soil. You see the measure of the total salt. We used four with a saturated paste. Greater than four, we call it a saline soil. That's the saturated paste. We'll talk about that in just a minute, too. Okay. SAR of greater than 13 was sodic. ESP greater than 15 was sodic. These are old numbers. We are rewriting all of this. We're going to work with the NRCS to put out some bulletins on it. New NRCS research project for North and South Dakota. We're still going to go with four as a saturated paste of the saline soil. But here, we're going to use, in North Dakota, they're using five. In South Dakota, we're using four. An ESP of five. So, a lot of different numbers here than what we originally thought. And that's why when I go get the soil samples from these south areas from out in the field, and I bring them in for my students to work on, you're doing water infiltration. I have an SAR of five or six. And it's like, that's why the water would go through it. Because there's too much sodium in those soils already at an SAR of four or five. Okay. So, now, when you're testing for salts, there are some questions you need to ask a soil testing lab. Because what we're going to do is, first of all, we have to determine the total salt content. And then we've got to figure out how much sodium is in that total salt content. All right? So, just a percentage. Okay? So, when they extract for salts, soil testing labs will either use, most of them use a one-to-one extract. So, what does that mean? That means that you take 100 grams of soil, and you mix it with 100 grams of water, and you mix it together. And that's a one-to-one extract. Okay? Then you let that sit for a little while, and you'll put an EC probe in there, and you'll measure the electrical conductivity. With the saturated paste, that is totally different. With the saturated paste, what we do is we take the soil, and my kids love to do this. All right? You guys probably all did this when you were little. Your grandkids do it. You take a cup of soil, and you mix it with enough water just until it looks like melted chocolate. Okay? And that's called the saturated paste. You let that sit. That settles out. And then you measure what the EC is in the top of that saturated paste. So, we have two very different ways of determining EC. Here, we have a much more dilute method than what we have over here. Because you're not going to need it. If you take one-to-one, you take 100 grams of soil, 100 milliliters of water, and mix that together, you're going to get a fairly dilute solution. Here, remember, we're going for melted chocolate with the saturated paste. Okay? Why is this important? Because the EC is used to estimate the total salt. So, if we're going to calculate our percent sodium, we need to know the total percentage of salts that are there. We can use our EC to do this. Okay? But we have to make sure that we understand the method that we're measuring the total salts. Okay? Because if we look at concentration of sodium on the top of the fraction and the concentration of total cations in the bottom, if we have a different number down here, that's going to make our percentage different. Okay? So, because EC is used to count the total salt, it's required for SAR or the ESP. Okay? So, here, this is how this kind of goes. If I'm reading an EC of 4, and that is a sodic soil on a saturated paste, that is going to be equivalent to an EC of 2 in a 1-to-1 dilution. Okay? And remember, we're looking at our criteria for a saline soil is EC equals 4 on a saturated paste. It's not EC equals 4 on a 1-to-1 dilution. Okay? So, here, and if we go take that, some labs may do a 1-to-5 dilution. Once again, we're diluting that out. An EC of 4 on a saturated paste equals an EC of 2 on a 1-to-1 dilution equals an EC of 0.72 on a 1-to-5 dilution. So, understanding how the EC is calculated is very important when you're trying to determine the total salt that you have out in the soil. Okay? This needs to be taken into account when making management recommendations. Okay? So, here's a little graph, and I also should mention, too, I have a very technical article. It's available out on one of the tables. There's only about 60 copies of it. But a lot of this information that we are, that I have here, we are putting in where we have a form manual that was very form when it was initially made. And we are rewriting that completely. And we're going to have the chapter for saline-filted soil management, that draft chapter. And we're going to have that out in the, right there. I'll put them on the registration table. We've got two different ones. But we'll be able to... Yeah, and there's also a really good one there from North Dakota. So, if you're interested in some of these, the stuff that I'm showing here, if you want some information about this to take home and read, Ruth will have that back out on the table back there. Okay? So, just a little general guideline, too. Texture's really important, too, when it comes to measuring our EC versus our, we're going to do with a saturated paste or a 1-to-1 dilution. Okay? Dave Franson did this back in 2007. He's a soil scientist up at NDSU. So, keep that in mind that when you are testing for salts, you're going to ask for the EC. The EC is going to estimate your total salts in that soil. Okay? What that number represents is going to be different based upon your extraction methods. So, when you talk to a soil testing lab, you need to know their extraction methods. Now, we've contacted a lot of our soil testing labs around here. About Iowa State is about the only one that's running a saturated paste. So, if you go to North Dakota, University of Minnesota, AgVice, Ray Ward lab, pretty much everybody is doing 1-to-1 right here. Okay? Now, what type of sodium index are they calculating there? What types of values are they looking at there? Well, pretty much everybody, AgVice labs up in North Dakota, Minnesota Valley testing, Ward lab, pretty much everybody there is running, pretty much everybody is running the ESP. So, that's what you're going to probably, that's the type of data you're going to get. Okay, so now, soil sampling for salts. Alright, so, where are you going to stand? The top six inches, you know? Is it going to be like phosphorus where it doesn't move? Is it like nitrate or chloride where it's going to move? So, what are you going to think about for soil sampling for salt? Okay, so, when we look at soil sampling, Okay, now I'm, once again, I teach soil, so I've got to use some soil terms here, everybody. Okay? Alright, taxonomy. Okay? Soil scientists, you know, with biology, you know, we have a taxonomic system where you classify, you know, all the different types of organisms. Well, soil scientists also have their taxonomic system as well, too, where they come up with this long name right here that describes kind of what the soil is. I'm going to use an X-line and an Aberdeen soil. These soils are more common up in the, probably up north up by Redfield and up in that area here. You guys, your soils down here probably be like a beetle soil or something like that down here, your soil series name. Fine, smectic, frigid, leptic, natrodol. Okay, that's our X-line soils. It's a soil series name that you would see in your, on the NRCS soil survey map. And an Aberdeen, fine, smectic, frigid, glossic, natrodol. Okay, so what does all this mean right here? Fine texture, a lot of clay, cold climate. Differences are here. Alright? Natra, natric, sodium. That means you have sodium in it where you have quite a bit of rainfall. And this means that it was derived from a grass plant soil. Okay. So what is the basic difference between leptic and glossic when we look at this? Okay. Leptic means that you have the absolute worst sodium conditions that you could have. Glossic would be the best. Typic would be in the middle. Okay. Right here, here is an example of a leptic soil. These slides are from Tom DeSutter up in North Dakota. You guys didn't have as good a picture as him. Okay. So the sodium is very close to the soil surface. With sodic soil, you get this columnar structure. So if you see something like this out in your field, this kind of columnar structure that starts to form, and the soil is really, really hard and dense, you most likely have sodium there. Okay. Glossic means that that sodium is deeper in the soil profile. So you get it down in here, something like that, where you see kind of that hard pan. Okay. Anyway, you get these hard pans forming here in South Dakota. A lot of times those hard pans are due to that sodium in there, making that soil really dense, so nothing will grow through it. Okay. Like I said, here, and of course these areas are going to be interspersed between each other. Okay. These areas, as you know, in your field are small. Okay. And they're scattered out. Okay. And the degree of sodium issues, you can change in a very short, short period of time. So here's the leptic where that sodium is more on the soil. Surface right there. Nothing's going to grow there. And here's that glossic over there. Okay. So soil sample. How deep? Why? Where? And where are we in the soil sample? Okay. Agronomic is two feet. Typically that's what we're looking for. Okay. Now, I know there's a lot of different opinions on tile, tiling in the audience here. All right. If you were tiling with these sodium, sodic fields is something that's kind of tricky. Okay. It can cause problems. Okay. At least three feet to figure out where that sodium is. Okay. If possible to the depth of the tile. Why do we want to do that? It's a lot of work. Why do we want to go that deep? If we are going to tile, we want to invest in that tile. We want it to work. Okay. What happens is, if you're evaluating for a drain tile there, then you need to look down at least three feet deep. Here's why. Okay. So here's a picture. This here are three different types of X-line soils up by Aberdeen, up in that area there. Right here, we have the SAR right here. And then the surface below, the depth below the surface. Okay. Here's your X-line right here. Okay. So here we had not very high SAR at all. All the way down. All the way down to 30 inches. Okay. Almost three feet down. Here, on the X-line one, we start at about four. Okay. So North Dakota says that five, they're dispersed. We come down here. What about two feet? We're at 10. With this last X-line right here, we start at about six. Ten inches down, we're at about SAR of 15. About 18 inches down, foot and a half, 20 inches, we're at SAR of 25. And at almost three feet, we're at an SAR of almost 27. Okay. So now, you go put a tile line in here. Okay. You put that tile line below that sodium horizon. I think you're going to get water to flow in there. Get your sodium horizon here. Get your tile line down here. Is water going to flow? No. No. Yeah. So why is it going to flow? What's that sodium doing to that subsoil surface? What's it doing? It's dispersing it, right? It's dispersing it. Okay. So here's the problem right here that we see. That's why I don't know if tiling is a very good idea in South Dakota with the types of soils that we have. So when we have, it's kind of like a balance. You can think of it as a teeter-totter. Okay. So if we have quite a bit of sodium in here, okay, in the soil, and we have a high EC, we'll have a dispersed soil. All right. Because we have enough calcium and magnesium over here to flocculate that soil and have some soil structure there. If we take and we start tiling and we start moving some of those other salts out of this water, we start moving some of that calcium, that magnesium, out of that soil through that tiled water. Remember the sodium, it's going to move up and down pretty fast. If it gets up, it's going to disperse the soil and still move if you get water through there. If you can't get water, you can go through there because it's dispersed. Okay. So right here, that's the problem. So, you know, may negatively impact, you know, flow of water from a tile line. You know, water doesn't flow from a tile if the field still remains wet. So that's why when it comes to tiling in South Dakota, you need to know what your subsurface soils are. You need to know what types of soils you have there. You know, because if you do have sodium down deep, tiling is not really a good option. So any questions so far about that stuff? All right. So soil management. How can we manage this? And I have until, how long do I have until late? 15 minutes. Okay. All right. So it sounds good. So how do we manage this? So we've looked at this a couple different ways. Okay. We've looked at this by putting soil events on, and we've looked at this by putting perennial crops on. I'm trying to put cover crops out there. Okay. Studies that we've done. We've worked at Pierpont. We've worked at Andover. We have to say we're going to put in a falcon. So Pierpont's been Greg Topol. I have to give credit to the farmers we're working with here. Pierpont is Greg Topol. Andover is Roger and Grant Ricks. Redfield is going to be, we're working with Jim Miller, crop consultant there. And then Kenny Selman is the, he farms the land. And Jerry West is the landowner. That's who we've been working with here. And then down in your area down here, we've been working with David Gillen at White Lake. So these are the farmers who we've worked with. We couldn't do this research without them. Right. So what we've done is we've looked at, okay, now if we have too much sodium there, if we add some calcium, can we improve that flocculation? Okay. So what we've done is we've taken and we've put out our studies where we put all these plots out. We designed them so we can do statistics on it. We can do statistics, you know. So four blocks and the treatments that we've put on are going to be calcium sulfate or gypsum, elemental sulfur, calcium chloride, or no salt. Those are the types of salt. That's the treatments that we're putting out there. Okay. And then what we've done is we've done two cover crop treatments. Of course, we've thought, you know, there's no, there's nothing growing out there. Okay. Because the salts are so high. Drilled into corn. In Redfield, we've had some luck. We have more of a saline soil there. A lot of the cover crops we've just put into the soil. If we drill it into corn, we're putting it into these sticks. But we're always putting the cover crops, planting them probably about mid to end of June with after these salt and then we're going to put them in. Okay. So now you say, I have salt. You're telling me to put more salt out there. All right. That doesn't make any sense. Right. I have salt and now you're going to tell me to go put more salt out there. Okay. Well, here's what's happening. Okay. The salts, most of them have a component to either sulfur or in the case of chloride, okay, where they're going to lower the soil pH. All right. So if we put anything with sulfur on, so if we put an ammonium sulfate, if we put gypsum on, if we put elemental sulfur on, what happens is we lower the soil pH, we release calcium from the line and we hope to be able to exchange that with the sodium on the exchange set. So that's why I showed you that picture of cation exchange. That's what we're trying to do. We have too much sodium on those exchange sites. We're trying to lower the soil pH, bump a bunch of calcium off, flood the system with calcium, and through cation exchange, now we have more calcium in solution. We'll promote the movement of the sodium off that exchange site, get it in solution, and now once sodium is in solution, we can get it to go down if we get rainfall. Okay. Okay. Elemental sulfur takes longer to work than gypsum. Okay. So if I'm going to put out, when we look at this, when we look at comparing elemental sulfur and gypsum, elemental sulfur, we need to oxidize that down to sulfate to form our acid to get the calcium off. So typically when you put amendments on, if you're going to apply amendments, you put elemental sulfur on, it's going to take about six months to work compared to gypsum. So you need less of elemental sulfur. Okay. Okay. So anything, so here's what we're doing. Any amendment with sulfur lowers the soil pH, releases the calcium cations into that solution to exchange with the sodium. Okay. And we have to have formation of that hydrogen, of the acidifying of that soil to get that calcium off. So that elemental sulfur, when it's applied, it's straight S. We need the soil bacteria to oxidize that into our sulfate so we can have that acid formation. So that's what we're doing. I'm asking you to apply salt, but I'm really not asking you to apply salt. I'm really asking you to apply something that has an acid in it to lower that pH and get that calcium off. Okay. So here, let's take a look here. I just did some study here. So this is Pure Pond, South Dakota right here. This is our, there we go. Right here. So I don't have a very good pointer. In the red box up there, here's my Pure Pond site, sodium right there, 4,846 parts per million, SAR of 19. Bad soil. Okay. That's the first thing I'm going to talk about. What we did here is we had, this is what the plots look like right here. These plots, this is put on a year after these photos were taken. Okay. So here's site number one. No treatment, no salt amendment, no cover crop. Looks pretty ugly. Looks like, it looks like concrete. And those are the white salts on the surface. So that's the first one right there. This one here is calcium chloride. We had some cover crop on the surface. You can kind of sort of grow it right there. We had a big rainfall that came down through here after we planted our cover crop. Kind of grow it a little bit there. Cover crop we planted with barley and sugar beans. So that's that one right there. Here's gypsum down here. So gypsum down here. You can roll it a little bit better right there. You can roll it a little bit better there. That's the gypsum right there. Fewer salts on the surface. And here's our elemental sulfur right here. And if you look at this elemental sulfur right here, you can see that that soil doesn't have quite, it doesn't have the white salts on the surface that these other ones do. So at least in this study, with the conditions that we saw at Pierpont, where we had the high sodium, the high SAR, now we have a lot of magnesium in this soil too. Okay. That has an influence as well too. But at least here, we saw we put an elemental sulfur a year before. he came out and planted a cover crop in there of barley and sugar beets the barley way better than the sugar beets did I agree and you know what great total has a huge problem up there he's just like you I asked him I said okay what can we work in this field he says you could do anything you want is what he said so I yeah and we don't think we what would happen is if we start growing all these weeds for a cash pop then they start getting disease in the diet yeah that's exactly what would happen okay all right so right here element of sulfur you'll buy them germinated go pretty well just some some of the barley germinated calcium chloride salt so how much should we put on we do these calculations based upon SAR or black and we would rather use EC or ESP to do the calculations we just then we put on to lower that almost as you know four times per acre right there cost 12 cents so it's not cheap calcium chloride works really fast okay you can put calcium chloride on calcium part is highly dissolvable in the soil you should not put calcium chloride on if corn is going there I learned that the hard way so but it came back I thought I was going to be dead I think we put some on I told the graduate students I said make sure you put it down the middle of the road I said do not put it near the corn plant so what they did is broadcast it all over you can look at the corn plant for the calcium chloride they look like they were gone but then fortunately we had a big rainfall two days later all the calcium chloride went down the corn started looking a lot better so I felt a lot better about that mother nature intervene I'll let go software you don't need as much all right so that's a little bit cheaper but it takes a lot longer to react and of course no stalls it doesn't cost any money if you don't do anything now so how are these rates calculated so I'm running out of time I only have five minutes left I am interested in learning on how you calculate these the information from your soil test is the kind of change capacity of the soil you need that measure and you need the ESP I would prefer the ESP versus the SAR and so what we would want to do is we want to reduce the ESP in that surface soil down to at least five percent if not less okay so I'm not going to go through these calculations because I'm running out of time here if you want to go through these if you're interested in this from a you know from a consulting point for applying gypsum I can show you how to do it it's also in that guideline up there there's some nice boxes and step-by-step details on how to do it but there but this is the method where we use the ESP and what we're basically trying to do is we're trying to take that we know this is the total salts on the surface you know what our ESP is we test that if you want to go down to five what's the difference between what our ESP is to go down to five that is going to be that's what the math that we work out to determine how much of an amendment that we put out okay I guess I'm going to run out of time okay now they said since these amendments are a little bit different the word we use when I teach soil science is molecular weight the mass you can put on just like with lime a different line product you can put on different rates based upon what their mass is so if I put on one ton of gypsum I can put on 0.19 tons of sulfur I could put so far gas so for gas I put 57 calcium chloride 0.86 and so on so last what I just want to mention is this here I know I'm almost out of time after five minutes here or not three okay okay okay okay so here David Gillen he's a great producer is he David Gillen here I don't know I don't know if he's coming today okay so here's an area in his field right here white salt 2010 contact the desk we got some money from the corn council what can we do so site we did a field day down there 2011 tall wheatgrass right here looks just beautiful that's this old white site right now the soil pit okay look at this here those little but snow out there in August four inches down very very few salts right there no salt on the surface right here down the bottom of the pit soil science you're talking about redox features okay redox features means that you have this orange in here these orange colors like can't really see but right in there right in there and these iron is been oxidized if you have a piece of old equipment that sits out in the woods you don't pay attention to it what happens to it if what happens to over time it will what rust okay when iron in the soil is the president of oxygen it does the same thing it turns orange so I know that where I had those cell problems now that four foot down my soil profile I have redox features that are orange there's no hasn't been water there for a few years soil a lot of water table is deeper down here here is a pit that we dug right by his cornfield in his cornfield as a matter of fact sorghum corn a soybean rotation water at the bottom of the pit okay white salt right up by the surface up there okay so here's what's going on um oh shoot okay right here uh white great here's our uh soil uh white lake right here that we did this in august right here the wheat by the side right there uh uh the sar by the side right there uh uh i'm hitting too many buttons right here the sar was one sodium is 179 here the right in the the the pit in the cornfield horizon one two and three sodium 1296 sar borderline right there okay we have we have sodium issues there okay so like you said i talked a little bit more about this but i'm running out of time bruce kunze did work with uh looking at the current energy as soil scientist looking at water table depth here where is the water right here these lines are where the water table depth is based upon precipitation look at this where we had alfalfa and grass 2010 we had all that rainfall we had the same problem south dakota you guys did okay too much rainfall even when we had all that rainfall where we had that grass and where we had that alfalfa right there that water that um that soiled that water table was considerably lower okay so i'm going to end there because i'm running out of time i'm going to go here and i'm going to give the credit to all my the people that they helped with our research and then right there okay so like i said i really appreciate coming and talking to you about cells here i think it's an important subject i want to take two quick questions if anybody else quick questions i must be around yep i'll be around yep and so if you're interested in talking more about that i'd be happy to answer your questions thank you very much i've been so you .
