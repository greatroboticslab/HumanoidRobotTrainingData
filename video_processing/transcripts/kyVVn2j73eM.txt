 so guys I got um oh shoot the mosquito I'm frightened there with my voice so um this this one my outside oh whatever this um one gallon yeah I think that one is a gallon pan can hold them for one day at five days old and I said to you guys earlier that this is 60 odd chicken more 61 chicken yeah so that can hold them I'm gonna feed another pan to me so my gimme some water when I'm extremely thirsty so chances are instead of me fold the pan now I make it over to tomorrow I'm gonna fold the pan later again since then I'm gonna fold the pan twice per day yes ensures that tomorrow they have water see because they're not supposed to run out of water which is very critical in Kenya they're not supposed to run out of water as you can see now them pen is a little mock mock yeah so we have treated paper see we still have some treated paper so I'm gonna just put more treated paper in there um yeah so I'm gonna put it take all the water pan feed the pan throw the treated paper in there and then we'll replace all of that back replace all of that back we're done that with I replace them and um yeah so that's basically that what is it they are eating up there so anyway let's take a close-up view inside these wall hey baby hey chick chick i just thought how they're curious you see i wonder how they're reacting to a mirror in a damn pin yeah okay okay i'll get to know you know i really have my tripod one thing with the treated paper it easily absorb uh the moisture in the pen or in the chick's droppings so every time you look at it and it seems as if it's a little damp remember you have to you have to put um treated paper in there if treated paper is what you have using or sawdust is what you have using remember they are supposed to be kept dry and warm at all times these are baby chick you have to care for them like how their mother in would i don't have the lights on on them um yeah because it's time the light can be turned off yeah but i still try to ensure that they are warm so it's the daytime a little sun is shining and um i ensure that these the top all ends drop and you know they're they're warm see them now as i said if them did lift them look really cool you don't see them each up on one another and they're not doing that so basically they are out and they are being vibrant and everything of course the mothers didn't need to be close to each other yeah we may talk for them like to them are you i mean but yeah of course you know just like how them said dog of personality chicken do have personality too yeah this is how this is how you care for the five days old chicken ensure that you maintain the temperature in the brooding here that is 90 to 95 degrees fahrenheit that's like 30 to 32 degrees celsius this is how you can't get the temperature in the water and you can't get the temperature in the water you can't give them the feeding that they cannot pick up and if they pick pick pick pick pick to get smaller so you have to give them crumble if that's what it's called in your area or your country ensure that them have clean fresh water all the time change your water frequently to prevent bacterial growth so when them drop in the water if you're not changing water they can't pick up bacteria stunt them grow or them even die um ensure that them have good ventilation to prevent and yes to prevent ammonia built up um check check them monitor them for any sign of illness such as labor breathing or diarrhea you need to check their stool the color of their stool as well the brooding area should be clean daily cleaning can be putting in sawdust because it's damp or just just cleaning it for me i put sawdust in there or i use threaded paper when the brooding areas keep clean it prevent disease and odor build up monitor the feeding take so as you can see from the earlier part of the video you will see that they've finished them feeding so i know the amount of feeding i gave them in the night or give them during the day or in the evening when i looked at them and i know what i'm expecting when i go back and check on them in the morning so if i go back and i still see the feeding in there similar to the amount i know that they are not eating the right way so there must be something wrong right um ensure that they have enough space yes they have enough space now as soon as them start have less space it's time for me to move them out because my brooding area is small check if they start a feather um in previous video i think it was day two my cheeks some of them start to grow feather yeah on their wings and stuff so check to see if most of them start to grow feather now or if they are not and they should grow feathers start to grow feather on their wings and tails check if they are active they must be active running up and down and playing around making noise when they make noise you're checking for vocalization they're making noise they're chirping and so on they should be active they are not active something is wrong and that is the first thing i always look out for whenever um the distributor deliver my chicken i always ensure that they're active if they're not active and i start worrying my head because they're not active by a little specky i see one two three all i did so i'm gonna want to make sure that my chicken is active so guys that is it what the hell is wrong with my
