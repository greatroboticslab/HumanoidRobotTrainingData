 We were formed to reside with God amid the splendor of the garden. Wow, you're a floral arranger. How did these deep truths come out? I felt like every time I would go into the garden, the Holy Spirit would reveal just a little bit more and a little bit more to me. And I thought, oh my goodness, you know, this is our story. Our story starts in the garden with flowers. And the Lord, in His mercy, you know, flowers are just extra, right? They're all extra. We grow the garden for food and for sustenance, and flowers just seem extra. But the fact that they were there in the beginning, they hold a huge importance.
