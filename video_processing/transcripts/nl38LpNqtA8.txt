Everything is going well! Music Music Right, that's good to see! Well I better get this game started because I'm pretty sure my character's going to fall asleep! I logged in the other day to send a screenshot to somebody and I've got that black screen again! Oh, God blimey! It lets me know what it is now! It's just my character falling asleep standing up! I can understand that! Yep, he's asleep! I knew it! I wait for him to wake up this time! Instead of starting with a black screen like we did last time! Come on! Wake up! There we go! Right! Lets hold that! Now we need chats! We want that one! We want that one! Let's try text to speech! See if we get that one working today! I need to add those! I'm going to try and get to that this week! I do not have any of the blurbs working in here! Was it a blurb? I think it was! Ummm I need to go back to installing that software! We've been testing for a couple of weeks now! We know everything else is working! I think what I'll do! Is I'll go back to running my Source Clone this week! Source Clone will bring all that back! Yeah, unfortunately we had issues! So I switched extra stuff off! And never added that one back! Alright! Let's jump into this shall we! Hello and welcome! To today's livestream! I'm Glen Bixley! And we are back! With more Farmers Live! Welcome everybody! Take a bit of a look around! Just to see where we are! Ok so this still is still running! Get it! Still running! Ok I'll come down! Daz! How you been my friend! Good to have you here Daz! Thank you buddy! I don't know if I say it enough but you're a great moderator and I do appreciate you! Blueberry Mash will be ready in 11 minutes! Ok! 11 minutes! We've got 28 o'clock! So we're all right there! We're all right there! Ok! Now for anyone that might be new! Welcome! This is our farm in the dark! Let's switch our lights on! There we go! So in the last couple of weeks what we've done is we have built a pigsty recently! We've built all new sheds! We get to see them better in the daylight! We do have all these new sheds built which we can have a look at shortly! We have a new chicken coop! We have a new entranceway! And a new mushroom farm! And we have 30 hours on those potatoes! Right! So! Let's go to bed and wake up in the morning! And let's get this day started! What was our temperature by the way? We're coming into winter I think! 18 degrees! Yes! It's getting a little cold! Ok! In the clock! Ok! Alright! So yes! Let's go to bed! We shall wake up! Oh! 10 hours sleep sounds pretty good! I think! Because we're coming into winter! No! Let's go with a 10 hour sleep! We'll do some longer sleeps in winter I think! Let's actually see how that sets us anyway! For stamina! Oh! I've never noticed that! So even the night takes a little longer! Ok! While you're sleeping! Ok! We do have full stamina! Excellent! Yeah! Everything is a little slower now! We changed our clock speed! Or at least our game speed! Last week! And I am now playing with reduced speed! We're at 0.1 speed! Which I am finding a lot more relaxing and enjoyable! Really love the slower speed! Let's grab! Oops! Wrong button! Keep forgetting! You can't do that! Let's drag you over and we'll grab! 8! There's more than enough! We only need like 2! 3! There you go! I wasn't far off! 8! Oh my head is better! Okay! It's quite decent! We have a lite bit more than a cave Nintendo. My god! 3! Oh, there you go! I wasn't far off. Alright, next bottle is... what? 1 hour 42. Ok, and we still have mash. So let's throw that back in here. We have 6 bottles of moonshine to sell. Beautiful. Why am I holding on to some mash? Because I just took that off the stove clean. Alright. I think what we should do today is buy some more distilleries. Now I've had a few people criticize that I only have one still. And considering I brew in real life, I do agree. One still is just still not enough. Ah, let's... oops, not the lights. No, not the lights! The door thingy. Right, thank you. Let's have a quick drink with some water. Go check on our animals. Make sure they're all good. We'll grab some food as we go and do our rounds. Actually, let's just... Because this is so much more organized now. Let's do our rounds properly. We need... a pitchfork. We need a brush. Oh, we need our coffee. Oh, we've actually got some in there. Actually, we'll leave some in the tool shed. I think that's probably a good idea. Alright. Alright. This is so much more organized. Look at that. We can go straight from there to there. 116 food. Oh, that might be a little too much. Oh, no, we can carry more now. I forgot. I also turned up the carry capacity. So I wouldn't have to spend so much time running back and forth all the time. Because that can be a little boring to watch as a live stream. We've got the pretty good idea on how the base game runs now. With time. As well as... Oops. The cat is still missing. Yes. With time and everything else, we've pretty much got that suss now. Can you move? Because I want to get that poo without getting you. Alright. We'll clean this place up before I brush them, I think. This is much nicer with fewer pigs. I should clean up the dun. I did! So, now we've got a few less pigs. Or fewer... fewer... fewer... yeah, we've got less pigs. And there's a lot more space in here. Hey, Fluffy! This is certainly a lot easier to get around. The only thing is... We're going to want some of this done. For our fields in spring. Hopefully there'll be enough. Alright. Let's clean these guys up. Actually, if I put that on two. And I put the pitchfork on... One. That'll make it easier. Right, now we can just hot-key these. So, yes, we'll just feed the animals. We'll clean up the place a little bit. There's a bit of dung I missed. And then we'll figure out what we've got to do. So, we are coming up towards winter now. I have one small potato crop. Other than that... We're pretty much just getting ready for what's going to be my longest winter. And I say that because of the slower time. But, it may mean... All these jobs that I keep saying I will do in winter... Are finally going to be able to get done. So, this enclosure here... The pigsty. Was one I've been trying to do for about three years in game. In game years, I mean. And never actually managed to get it done until last winter. So, much nicer. I think we'll keep all the trees and everything in here. I kind of like those for the pigsty. That's right. This is a small game, isn't it? I keep forgetting about that one. Ah, our berries. All along the back of the house. We've got some wood there. Alright, so we've got to clean up a little bit this winter. Do we brush sheep? We do. I stepped on dung, dammit. We better clean that up first. Alright, we'll give the ladies a haircut. Ah, not a haircut, sorry. Give him a brush. We'll clean up all this dung. Hey, Moo Moo. How are you? Oh, this is so much better with less animals. You don't step in it everywhere you go. My shoes reek. I didn't step in it, did I? Oh, man. Now my shoes are going to stick all day. I'm going to stick all day. So much easier to clean up when you've got less animals. I think what I need to do as part of our new organization this winter, will be to make separate areas for each animal. So this will be for the cows. At the moment the sheep are in here. Oh, I need another bin back here, don't I? I do. No, we've got this one. We've got the original one. I forgot about it. Right, that's the very first one. Right, why are you sleeping in the dung pile? Recovering after giving birth. One month. Okay. You live for 15. So we might sell you this year. Well, maybe it wasn't you. Maybe it was a rat. Fatness. Pregnant. Seven months. Not... Get back here when I'm brushing you. Lamb chops. I remember watching lamb chops when I was a kid. Was that not the lamb chops in me? We could make lamb chops. We certainly could. Hey, get back here. Oh, you're done. All right. I love lamb. Lamb is my favourite meat, I have to say. I eat a lot of chicken, but that's because it's cheap. When I was a kid, lamb used to be cheap. Some of you have probably heard that New Zealand's, in theory, a country with more sheep than people. That's true, but we need more sheep in this country. We used to have more. And now, there's not enough. Lamb is so expensive here. Used to be a really cheap meal. All right. Let's... Actually, we're going to need... We're going to need probably a bin in here. Let's do that now. To keep a milking bucket. That's not what you meant to press. Because I would like... A milking bucket here. A chest. Big chests, aren't they? So we might build this this winter. Just to... Make sure that we have... Stuff for the cows. Oh, a tree needs material. Keep forgetting in this game, you have to have materials to lay down a blueprint. That's all right. We'll get to it. Okay, you can cancel the blueprint now. Thank you. We'll get to that. So that'll be something we'll do during this winter as well. Right, let's throw some food in here. Excellent. We'll shut that actually. That's right, I left the other side open in case chickens decide to come in here. Now, we've got no animals in here at the moment. All right. We brushed the dog in this game. I've never thought about this. Let's try brushing the dog. Oh, you're 100% clean. Still have not seen the cat. No, no idea where the cat's gone. But there is food in the cat's bowl. So that's not an excuse. Maybe we could try finding the cat today. Because we did find some animals last week. Amazed at the amount of animals we found with slower time period. Is there a bucket in here? We could use this one instead of the shed bucket. Oh, I want that. And we'll give that to the pigs. Or give that to the pigs. So they have a second food bowl. All right. Ah, wrong button. Inventory. If I bring the tractor through that way. Let's actually just pop it over here. Make it nice and easy when they're side by side. There we go. Plenty of food for the pigs. No excuse for them to not fatten up the season. Because last year they got a bit skinny. When we sold them, they were all very skinny. I'm going to keep the brush. I was about to get rid of it. But let's see. Oh, yeah. Okay. Stupid idea. I was about to say, let's see if we can brush a chicken. Or a duck. How are you going to catch it, Glenn? Right. Now that we've got a lot of food trees in here, we should end up with more chickens and ducks this year as well. Now, in this game, you do not need to worry about the eggs you take from the nests. They don't prevent the chickens from breeding. You can take them all. When I first started, I was leaving eggs behind because I wanted the chickens to breed. And then it didn't seem to make any difference, so I Googled. And according to the developers, on Steam, it says you don't need to worry about it. Some of those Steam forms are pretty good when you need help. All right. Go check our mushrooms. I think our mushrooms are going to need another day or so. But we do have... Chicken! I've got a brush! Watch out if I was you! I think I actually managed to brush that chicken. I heard the noise. All right. Why are you not? There we go. Okay. So, yeah. We've got a couple of days. We are going to run out of manure. We're going to need more animals just for the manure. Interesting. Unless we start buying poo! What's the best place to click? I've been clicking the hat, but I don't think... Oh, maybe it is. I can't say I don't think it is, but I don't know. Because, see, when you click these, they highlight. Oh, no. It did work. I must have just missed before. Oh, well. All good. Yeah, they have a day to go. We have another day on the potatoes. 19 hours. All right. Let's put our tools away. So, our sheds that we have. This is our new repair shed. We can actually repair our items. I wonder if a brush ever needs repairs. Do brushes ever need repairs? I had never thought about it before. I've never actually repaired one. I don't know how to repair this. Ah, that makes sense. What about this? You don't know how to repair it. Is that because it's not broken? All right. We have our new sewing shed. Last week, we made a whole lot of new clothes. So, we made a nightgown for when we get married. And we also made... Was it... Not bare fur? No. We also made... Forever tonight. Which set was it? Welcome, Michelle. How are you? Red set. Oh, we might need to get a red set. We need three wool and raspberry. We can actually make that. I might make some more cloves today. I want to see a few more of the clothing items. Nothing you can actually do in here. This is the sharing shed. But you don't actually need it. So long as you've got a sharing shed. And you've got clippers. You can share your sheep. I don't know who you're going to share them with. But it's always nice to share, isn't it? All right. Let's pop those away. Pop the rest of this food away. Oh. Oh. Okay. Is that all the food we have? I might have to think about that. We're going through a lot of food right now. Okay. So what do we have in the dugout? Okay. Is that cooked fish? Fried fish. Well, the fried fish does not need to be in the dugout. It won't go rotten. I don't know if these go rotten. That's an interesting one. We might have to try that this year. I think I did last season, actually. I think I did last season. I think they did go rotten. Oh, sorry. I'm thinking, what is that game noise? It's not actually a game noise. It's something outside. All right. Put our fish away. We don't really need that. We'll put our eggs away for now. We're not going to the shop right now. Okay. Yes, welcome, everybody. I hope everybody is having a brilliant day. And if you're new to the channel, thank you for joining us. I hope you subscribe. Because we've got a very friendly community. And I am so happy to have every one of you here. Let's do some more cooked ham. Requires a stove burning. That generally tends to be a... Thank you, everybody. Whether you be a subscriber, channel member. I definitely appreciate every last one of you. I don't say it enough. All right. We'll throw the ham on. An hour and a half. We've got plenty of time. I've got to better make sure it doesn't burn. But because we're not actually moving time so fast now. I should be all right with that. Actually, we could go sell all of this. And our eggs. What are we at? 22, wait. Let's grab our eggs. And anything else we have to sell. I'm going to sell these. Because we can't use three. We need four. And you can't plant them. Excuse me. Can't plant them. So, I think if we take that... I haven't milked the cows yet. I've got to milk the cows before I go. What is that? That's our sourdough. True. That's something I need to try in real life. Making sourdough. I've never made sourdough. Thanks for the doughno. Oh, $2. Thank you, Scrapmec. I appreciate it, mate. Thank you. Can we sell Mark? We would never do that. You know better than that. Why would you do that? Where would we be without people like you and Mark? Oh, I mean... I appreciate all of you guys. We'd never sell you. Okay. We do actually have a lot of broth I could sell. Now, somebody was asking the other day on the Discord how to make broth. And in all honesty, I don't remember how I made that. But the answer from the developers looked a lot more complicated than I thought. Apparently, getting the recipe is a bit of trial and error. A bit of experimentation. What are you doing the wiggle for? I haven't got him on leash by chance, have I? So apparently, there's a bit of experimentation. We're getting the right brute. What is your problem? Come here. I don't know what his problem is. I can't even get him out of the door. Alright. That's a load of bull. Never mind. Let's milk the cows. What? What? What? What? What? What? What did that say? Everything works just fine, but there's no milk yet. What's your problem? Fatness 96%. Pregnant 3 months. Oh. We might have to wait for her to give birth. Let's put you out in the field for the day. Oh, we got two from that one. We're going to let you out for the day as well. Come on, ladies. Come and enjoy the day. You didn't get a brush, though. That's probably not good. We'll get to you guys later. Well, ladies. Actually. Because you're both at 95%. Come over here where the food is. That cow got out! I just noticed. What happened to your friend? Did I not have her on the lead? I do? Okay. She's having issues. Okay, we're having a couple of issues today. That's right. At least now we're not in such a rush. Little issues like that used to stress me out a bit. Because... With the time flow... Oh, you're right there. What are you trying to do? With the time flow, it made it really frustrating. Because you'd spend 5-10 minutes trying to sort them out. Not such a problem now that time is slowing down. We'll ignore them. We'll move on. All right. So that's all of our little jobs done. Where should I put this bucket? Because I really need the bucket for milking the cows. What did I just see? Oh, the dog. All right. I think we should go and buy ourselves a new still. Get another one going. Get another one going. And then what we could probably do is use the stills to make more income. Okay. So we have... Okay. Let's put the milk away. I'm not selling my milk. We use that for making butter. We're probably better off to sell the butter. But at the moment, all my butter has been getting used for cooking. Because we're doing a lot of cooking in-game at the moment. Okay. All right. All right. We're good. Everything's good. So you guys. An hour and 16 minutes. I... Oh, the last king of retail. I thought you meaning... There's another one. What is it? Retail... The first one was really good. It was king of retail. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Okay. I misread. Yes. King of retail 2. It's actually out, is it? That looks... Well, I don't know about king of retail 2. But... I saw that the other day. Where's my bike? And king of retail. Looked like a really cool game. I don't know where my bike is. Oh. Well, how's anybody going to say on your bike? If we don't know where it is. Did I leave it in town? Or is it over here? Are you saying no to the potatoes, dog? You don't have to eat them. Maybe my bike's over here. Oh, there's a goose in the shed. There's my bike. Alright. Now you guys can sit on your bike. Oh, it's too late. I'm already on it. Let's have a look in this shed and see what's here. Let's just see what's here. I'm curious to know. No, that's the wrong one for this game. It's E. Oops. Oh, so we do have more food. I was thinking, I'm sure we have more food. Yeah, we do. We do. I'll sort that out when we get back. Or at least in winter. Something. Alright, so. Things found by Talca. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. That was last week. Alright. All the pigs are home now. Okay. Keep getting off on the wrong side of the bike. Our trailer's here too. Maybe we can take that home. Alright. You'll buy the eggs. Oops. Where's Henry? Has he just not spawned in? Where is Henry? Usually Henry, the drunk, is standing in the middle of town and trying to pick a fight for no reason. Actually, we don't need to go to everybody, Glenn. We just need to go to the ones that you have goods for. No costa. Nope. We haven't got to her yet. We'll get to her in a sec. Right. We'll sell that to you. Because we're going to have to go sell the rest of our eggs to the no costa lady. You'll buy that. You'll buy these. Oh, we should have used these pelts. Oh, there wasn't enough. True. I want to make some money today. We'll worry about making pelts in winter. We can go hunting in winter. Why am I trying to sell that to you? Can we pat the doggy? I want to pat the dog. Can I pat that dog? Oh, sorry. Oh, Henry's here. Henry's here. Um. I don't know where Henry got to. But he's here now. Are you not going to buy my beets? You are going to buy my beets. I just didn't try. You've already sold out on eggs. Yeah, they only sell so much of a certain produce. So if you've got too much, they will not buy it. You need to take it to the state farm. So what we might do is grab our trailer today. Because apparently I left it here for whatever reason last week. Well, that just sent it flying. Okay, let's try this again. Not sure why that didn't connect. Can you stay standing? No. I said stay standing. No. Ah. Ha ha ha. What am I doing wrong? Attach. Thank you. All right. So we get this trailer home. Then I think we should go buy a new still. How much money did we have? Two grand. That's enough. I'm pretty sure that's enough. Map. Let's fast travel home. One minute. All right. All right. Detach that. Whoops. Stuck. Stuck. Stuck. All right. All right. So now another thing discussed on the Discord. For any of you who are from the Farmers Life Discord. I did say I have most of the equipment. Because somebody was wondering about equipment. So of course this is your original tractor. It's generally found over that way somewhere. I think next to here. You need to put it together using the wrench. So if you. When you start. You'll have a wrench pretty sure. Otherwise you can go and purchase one. When you walk up to the tractor with the wrench. It will then tell you. What parts are required to fix it. I have the trailer. One of the most important things you'll need. We have the lawnmower. We have a tiller. Because somebody was suggesting that. The game needs a tiller. Sorry. A plow. So this is our three row plow. There is also a single row plow. I believe as well. But this is the three row. Then you've got the digger. So that is what we use to dig out our potatoes. And other vegetables. Then we have our manure spreader. What a load of shit that is. Ah. Sorry. I had to. And then of course our cedar. Probably the most important of all of our vehicles. Is the cedar. And I forgot. We had tobacco in the ground. 32 hours. Excellent. Alright. So that is most of the equipment. There may be a few other items that I haven't as yet got to. But that is the bulk of it. Okay. So we're going to head down now to the state farm. And go sell the rest of our eggs. I don't know why I always turn around. Oh. That was the other two pieces of equipment we purchased. Well we had one for a while. We have the threshers. So these are the big thresher. Which you put your grain crops into. It will give you wheat or other grains. But it also gives you a straw for feeding your animals. And then down here. Don't run that way goose. It's scaring your weight. We have our small threshers. Which we put some of our hay into. And then of course we get our fodder. As well as we get straw from that. Right. Let's fast travel. Is it Anne? I don't think it is Anne. Oh wait. I shouldn't have done that. Okay. Let's go and see. I'm pretty sure it's not Anne. I think I've come to the wrong person. But I was meant to go all the way into town first anyway. How you doing Anne? So yeah. No. Anne does not sell the stilts. I didn't think so. Okay. I think. That's Thaddeus' wife. Pretty sure that's Thaddeus' wife. But. We need to go sell the rest of these eggs. There we go. No costa. No costa. Alright. Check the board. Check our prices. So we are here to sell eggs. So you can see all your prices. For everything on here basically. No eggs though. Because eggs is not a crop. Glenn. You can't grow eggs. What are you crazy? Yeah. Okay. So it is only crops that you grow. Okay. Alright. Me my spry. Me my spry. Exactly. Here buy some eggs off me love. 500 bucks. Nice. That gives us 2.6. Excellent. Right. 2.6 should be more than enough to buy a stil. Pretty sure that's Thaddeus' wife. Let's go visit the wife. Thaddeus isn't a born to us right now. How you doing? Helen. That's your name. Okay. So. A distillery. They are 1,120 each. So we can afford 2. Freaking awesome. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Tobacco. But not tobacco seed. 68. We might better make some money. Buying tobacco. Rolling cigarettes. Which I really hate doing. Because it's such a thing that my brain doesn't work with. That's something we might try this winter. Actually we've only got 400 bucks left. Okay. Let's try that. I'm going to see. If we can take 400 dollars worth of tobacco. And make money out of it. And if you want to buy any of your tractor parts. Anything you need to assemble your tractors. This nice fine young man here. We'll sell you your bicycle. Your trailers. Your motor. For your equipment. All your tools. Including the wrench that you need to fix the tractor. And then of course your tractor parts. And a saw bench. So any of your tractor parts that you need to assemble your tractor. They're all right here. Yeah. Because I know somebody on the discord was having a bit of trouble. Trying to figure out how to get their tractor running. So. There's where you get all your parts. That's what you need. Let's head back home. With our two new stills. Now we might end up finding. Are you going to stand now? We might end up finding. That. We don't have enough room in this kitchen. Actually I have an idea. Disassemble the table. We don't need that anymore. We're going to get new furniture this season too. I want to get all new furniture this season. We're just going to pop that there. I like that. I don't know. I think that's rig. I guess that's a rug. I was going to call it a rag. It looks like a bit of a rag. Doesn't it? God blimey. I actually think what we could do is we rotate this cabinet. Now do I have to put it down or can I put it down? Put it down first. Then we'll move it again. We'll make this our brewing kitchen. I mean, is it the stool in the way? Is it the rug in the way? Cancel. I really am sure I can't go. Whoops, wrong button. I can't remember how to rotate in this game. This is our stool for rolling our tobacco. Pop that down there. Can I move a stool while it's still running? Oh, sorry. I can't. I don't know if that was a good idea or a bad idea, but we did it. And then what we can do... I can pop you out of the way for now. Actually, I can pop you back here because that's now moved. But I want to be able to see out my window. So let's grab this. Grab you out of the way. There's another thermometer here. Well, I've never even noticed this. Let's just pop it up there for now. I'm going to rearrange the room to make us a little bit more space. But brood. Right. Right... That violent protagonist thing, I got a laugh and I turned it off not knowing what it did. not knowing what it did and now that he's back to moaning again I kind of missed it I kind of like listening to him moan I don't know why it's going a bit further I think right up against the wall that's what we want all right I used oh let's go see I thought it was working for a sec what happened with the wood did we lose the wood when I picked it up we lost everything when I picked it up all right I should have left it alone should have waited but never mind what's done is done oh that's what I believe what about that cupboard when I picked up that cupboard well that still has the stuff in it that still has stuff in it and that still has stuff in it okay so we didn't lose all of that at least that's good what I might do though so I'm gonna pack up these cupboards because we don't use them we don't need them and I want to make a bit more space in this kitchen for the brood it's all one cupboard I'm pretty sure this is I've never pulled this one apart let's disassemble it's all one cupboard I thought it was right it's gonna get this stuff out of here for now and this will just give us a bit more space in the kitchen that's fine why are you off to one side that is really awkward okay and now we've got enough space for one more still we still have space for a still something like that get that plate up all right I think I like that much better much better we can put another cabinet down here actually all right so we have 24 minutes left on the hand okay excellent yeah when I took pick this up we lost everything we lost the wood we lost the water that's a real shame and we also lost the mash and anything else that was in it I don't think there was any brew because we actually picked that up okay we need another bucket as well there's a few things I want to get on top of this winter now that we've got more time we're gonna be able to do that excuse me I'm just a little um disappointed we lost all of that wood there was quite a bit of wood in that distillery but never mind oh it's saved okay no clean the stills so what we're gonna do is get all these stills ready to go we can get all three of them started now and we'll use the money from these to get another one actually you know what I should have done I should have taken the booze that we had in that cupboard and sold that to get another one we still could I think the actually the lady that sells us the stills will buy our booze all right yeah it's a pity we lost all that wood that would not be good uh so where do we have wood I'm just gonna check I'm pretty confident there's nothing in here I think there might be some in here for repairs 14 it's not a lot it's not a lot we're gonna take it we're gonna have to find some more we might have to go out this winter and just find wood oh we are gonna have to get more wood okay is that gonna be enough wood to at least get the three stills running if we go five five let's just try that for now while I've still got some some blueberry mash not raspberry mash ah stink oh I want to do an apple mash actually we've got three stills we could do apple mash in one start oh that's one seven trouble starting there we go okay three hours give it another bit of wood okay we have enough wood to do that excellent we'll do potato mash in here yeah I had a lot of wood in there I lost never mind that's life okay we're gonna need to get some more wood alright we're good put the mash back and we've got empty jars they can go off might put some jars in here for now I think what we should do is sell this booze yeah I have flowers what am I going to do oh flowers could go over here in the cupboard with the flowers on it there's yeast in here I must have run out of space and put yeast in there I didn't know it was in there we need to put that in the other cupboard just going to stick all of this in here for now more yeast we could do more bread then alright let's pop this down somewhere right here we'll do and we'll pop you down right that might light up our kitchen a little bit now I'm going to do the cigarettes later because I don't want to confuse the money on the brew let's go sell this brew actually I'm just going to leave this bucket in here tobacco we have more tobacco than I thought 27 tobacco we'll get to that shortly should I? no let's just do it all in one go actually I'm not going to do what I thought I'm going to leave that till later what we're going to do is roll some cigarettes now I have a bit of issues with this so you put down your paper and your tobacco then you get the dot has to stay inside the white bar but my brain always looks at it differently and I used to try and keep the white bar to keep up with the red dot which is completely wrong you've got to keep the red dot inside the white bar yes I've got more right today so far doing well nope we're definitely not last so we'll go sell all this booze we'll sell these cigarettes we'll go and get ourselves another still and then we're going to have to find some more wood now cigarettes can be used to bribe or make friends are you bribing people? or are you making friends? you need them anyway to bring up the level of friendship between you and some of the traders some people will like cigarettes oh that's what we needed cigarettes for today we needed to bribe somebody sorry not bribe it's probably the wrong word excuse me for a sec I'm going to take my jacket off god my throat is croaky today oooh get my jacket off starting to warm up now sun's out it's winter so I've got my window my curtains open letting the sunlight in during summer I tend to keep my curtains closed I'll keep the house cool up I'll keep the house cool up yeah I forgot we need these cigarettes in order to make friends with somebody I don't recall who it was though I really can't recall who we needed the cigarettes for we might have to go around and visit everybody whoops I screwed that one up let's do it again I do remember last week we went to try and trade with somebody it makes no sense to start without any tobacco yeah you're right it does we went to trade with somebody last week but we did not have a high enough friendship level so we need to sort that out today okay so that'll be already in seven minutes so we'll have to sort that out before we go anywhere oh it would have been this one next bottle ready it said one of the bottles was ready I swear it said a bottle was ready I don't know but we're going to run out of wood real soon alright I think what I might do very quickly is we just go and look for some wood we're going to need it we picked it all up out here now I can probably cut these logs into firewood it's not really a good use for oh that's not really the best use this is what we really need sticks take it all it's not much it's not much yeah we'll very quickly go over here into the trees get some wood so we can keep those stills running I have to wait seven minutes anyway for the ham to be cooked watch watchful and we need to do these while we're out I need sticks out in the trees it's not the best way to get up eh oh there's berry picking to do alright well that's what we're going to do then we're going to get berries we're going to get mushrooms and we're going to get sticks we'll kill eight birds with one rock or whatever that expression is yeah I hope you guys are enjoying this game I am I'm thoroughly enjoying it it's a great little game and the developers are listening to feedback so if you do have the game and you'd like to make suggestions okay there's no sticks in here you've got suggestions or ideas that the developers are listening they have a big list apparently of things they want to do hold your leg out here give me a second I need to clear my throat alright I don't know why I'm so creaky today that's why I'm so creaky I don't really like to cough or clear my throat when the mic's on I try to mute it alright yep we'll get some sticks we'll get some berries we'll get some mushrooms and then I think we need at least one more still to finish that kitchen we may get more of them later but for now the big problem is going to be keeping enough wood to keep them all burning so there's no point in me going out and buying 12 stills and then only being able to afford to run a couple because of wood that makes no sense at all that wood make no sense it's still a bad idea oh okay I'll stop with the puns they're not punny there's two we definitely need to come back and do a bit more of this today actually oh where's the hitbox stop being awkward thank you silly little stick silly little stick we should put the rifle as well so we could do some hunting come back in a minute alright we'll get those hams off the stove we're going to need to cut all this firewood this winter we'll use this for building next season another question that somebody had asked on this discord was in regards to making money out of selling wood from growing trees I wouldn't know because I've put all my wood so far into building right there's another four hams on hour and 25 hour and 30 perfect we're not going to burn that lot are we um I'll throw my berries in the cupboard we're going to make mash out of those probably uh we want to put the sticks into the stills I'm just going to put these tools in here for now just to get rid of them we're going to leave the cigarettes because we don't need to be carrying them and we'll come back to that bottle of boobus later oh except in this one I'll get the order of those right soon alright so how are we doing you have three you have two and you have one okay let's give you I didn't really do math very well at school ten for you that's eleven give you half roughly I'll give you half roughly I'll give you half roughly okay they all have around about ten each excellent now how much time do they have though burning for four and a half hours we're good and ten sticks seven uh seven hours ten sticks yep seven hours and eleven yep we're good we're good okay actually what I'd like to do before we take off again some raspberry mash don't need all of that and wool do I have any more wool I think we have some out in the shed outside I hope we do otherwise we might try and share some sheep I don't know how often you can share sheep in this game in real life you only share them once a year we do have wool okay some wool some string and why not we might actually try sharing some more sheep see if we can do it again in theory I shouldn't be able to no harm in trying though right now I wanted to try the red sand raspberry mash that's what we had raspberries oh oh yes it's not mash it's raspberries we need to make the mash oh fine be like that did we have raspberry mash no no blueberry mash okay there's a difference there is we'll get to that later but now throw all of this back in here let's go try sharing some sheep see oops oops we're just going to drop it in there we've got plenty of space in there right now I don't think we can but it would be interesting to see the sheep are not in here Glen that's pigs they look similar but they're not the same not the same right I don't think this should work oh can we shear them every day oh can we shear them every day we can shear the sheep every day we're going to end up with a lot of wool you have to have a searing set if you haven't got a searing set you can't see them don't worry cow I'm not going to try shearing you get a couple for me alright let's try fixing you because the fact that you're broken is kind of bothering me you're not going to move are you is it? I haven't done the math on that let's fix this cow now one thing that the developers said to me if you're having issues with any of the animals getting stuck put them on the lead and fast travel them to the entrance to your gate and so far that rule has worked because you're having a few issues with occasionally the animals do get a bit stuck in their path but that was the advice from the developers stick them on a lead and then just fast travel to the gate right actually we'll keep the wool on us because we put the other wool inside no I want to empty out my inventory we've got other jobs to do Glen let's head back we'll do some more berry picking actually if we take a bicycle and at least ride it up to the tree line that'll just hopefully get us here a little quicker I don't know if it actually does a pot where should we start think up here in this corner we can always find the bike next to this tree yeah exactly alright so we'll get some more berries picks, mushrooms we're heading up to Thaddeus that's where we're actually going oh but it didn't bring I didn't bring the boots with me lips doesn't matter can I have it? thank you can I have it? thank you oh oh I don't see I don't see I don't see that's where we're actually going oh but I didn't bring I didn't bring the boots with me lips doesn't matter All right. Yeah, it is actually really nice to have time to just come out and do this because I have not had time to get out and pick up sticks oh I didn't bring the rifle that's your fault Des you didn't remind me and speaking of reminding I need to bring my chat back up put it down when I'm muted because I always like to make sure that it unmutes and with the mic I've got it doesn't actually have a light on it so you can't tell if I've muted or unmuted and I like to visually check all right oh pardon well this should keep our stills running for a day we'll make a whole lot of mash and then I think next season if we've got four stills or maybe five I'm actually thinking five is a really good round number oh we're getting a bit of freezing we've got five stills the amount of booze that we'll be able to make in a day we should better make some pretty good money and now that we've got the better chicken coop our chickens will start to well chickens and ducks now we'll start to breed and we should get a few more of them in the past they were kind of struggling to get enough food between all of them and they weren't breeding very well I am kind of keen to see how much wood we would get if we cut up a log but at the moment I don't know if it's going to be worth doing I probably want to start growing some trees I wonder I've not grown any trees in this game should we try growing a tree I said a tree not an ice cream told you I should have brought the rifle I need to remember that when you go out from now on when we go out berry picking we've also got to get sticks mushrooms take the rifle and then what we need is little areas where we can just dump everything on the edge of the forest empty our inventory out near a road somewhere so you'd like this would be a perfect spot it's next to Thaddeus's farm it's really easy to remember where it is and if we drop this stuff on the edge of the road it's really easy to find so that's what we might have to start doing in future I want to know if we can sell clothing this winter as well who would we sell clothing to I'm guessing it would be the shop in town the general store so no mushrooms here oh there's some yeah I'm definitely preferring this more relaxed speed I like this oh it's a fox I was thinking was that one of my sheep no it's a fox a white fox I bet you we could make a really cool piece of clothing out of a white fox isn't it terrible when Glen now looks at animals and thinks clothing food now there's animals that look at us that think food too oh I bet you lions in africa look at people and think food Food. More mushrooms that went past. Alright. Done that one. What's that? Oh, it's a stick. And we probably didn't get you there. Now I've remapped my farmer's vision to my middle mouse button. I think it started out as Z. But I was having issues with that because I had to keep looking at my keyboard. I don't know what's good. So I've remapped it. I still have the Z. I think it's C. Yeah, it is. Yup. But I don't tend to use it. Middle mouse button is a lot more convenient. I'm not going to complain. I'm not going to complain. We're getting on. 42. When I first started, this is how I made all my money. I've had people on the disc. I'm not going to be able to go down the street. I'm not going to have to go down the street. I'm not going to be able to go down the street. we're getting on 42 when i first started this is how i made all my money i've had people on the discord asking what's the best way to make money i don't know i haven't figured that out yet but this is a really good convenient way to get started oh it's a deer i was thinking is that one of my sheep why do i keep thinking everything's my sheep hey we do all right i think considering this is how we started the game and we were struggling to make any money now when we have a harvest we can go out and spend good amounts of money i think we're doing it right okay the character's not any younger we definitely need to get him married off soon now i don't know what the story is verb as far as i know your character can die of old age i'm guessing it's probably around 65 years of age i'm guessing but i don't know oh three however what we do need to figure out what happens when he does die can you leave him an heir to carry on now this game has a before and an after so you've got the farmer's father which although it came out after this game is set before it you're actually playing the part of our father now i've looked at that one in the past at the time it needed more work but i do think we could go back and have another look at that at some point being the same developers hopefully they've made improvements to it and it could be worth trying again but then there is another one which the developers are working on which is set after this one and that's going to be cyber farmer i have no idea what it's like because it's still in development but that might be one that i'd like to try as well a robot farmer yeah i think something along those lines it seems a bit weird but i like this game and as part of the storyline i think it could be worth just at least at the very least taking a look is that a tree or an ice cream um definitely worth at least taking a look to see what it's going to be like yes i should have brought my rifle never mind okay i just thought i saw mushrooms there nope right i didn't actually bring anything on me but how much cigarettes sell for i never thought about it so oh i thought she had a sale price on here as well a buy and a sell price no we can buy them for 101 but i don't know what the sell price is i would have to have some on me okay no caster none at all what's that one cider oh we're making cider now okay so cider raspberry blueberry vodka moonshine okay okay and it still is 1100 it's still 1100 hasn't changed right yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh okay okay it's even an apple tree or something we need because apples can be used to feed the animals too maybe an apple tree would have been something good early game i don't know but for now let's head back okay we got some sticks finally we'll go check on what he was cooking where's our bike we'll go check on what he's cooking a quick drink there you're getting on 10 10 and 11. okay so they're actually still good they're still good oh sorry but i might do for now so we're just going to stick that in there it won't take it oh we're not gonna take it nope we're not gonna take it what about this one no that won't take it either can we put sticks in here brilliant all right let's empty out our inventory so we could go sell these berries let's actually see what we end up with 31 mushrooms 40 and 152 a lot of raspberry we really do i mean if i sold the raspberry i would not chocolates that were five each i think so that's only 500 if i sold them it's not enough for a still okay it's still not enough for a still oh we do have this that can't be right five is that the sale price that can't be right let's try let's sell that and i am gonna say thank those because we have way more than we can deal with right now so let's take a hundred we'll go and sell that i'm actually thinking let's just sell the meat let's okay here i go let's sell the meat but let's take the meat gathering device that could be a good way out going i think and if we're going to go out and sell let's get rid of these two okay 40 and 52 that sounds fair i think we'll keep that all right we have 12 yeast let's oh i'm too heavy way too heavy put something back actually actually hang on rather than put something back what we'll do is we'll drop the coffees we'll drop our buns 158. i'm just thinking if we get on the bike we can get on the bike oh i don't think it takes us any additional time because we're on the bike weight doesn't matter when you're on the bike let's just let's just let's just grab the bike bring the bike to the berries sure there's an old proverb there somewhere bring the bike to the berries pretty short and it'll still only take us about 15 minutes to get to the farm yeah because we're on a bike the weight doesn't matter what does it we seem to be biking really slow stop okay by god blinking blimey it didn't stop me my spry me my spry exactly here buy these off us love 2100 now we're talking all right does this guy buy our meat i'm pretty sure he does i don't normally sell meat to this guy you usually sell meat to the one in the town but pretty sure beautiful beautiful all right so what does that give us now 2600 it's enough there for another couple of stills mate why are we going backwards what's going on all right there you go fire that nice what is this raspberry mesh oh true okay but we want your last still right i might even buy another bucket 112 dollars no no no let's prioritize i won i think we're going to go up and visit anne or at least go to anne's farm and won't be here she's in the town what trees do you have oh you don't have any trees i thought she had some sort of tree here like an apple or something apparently not do you sell buckets for the same price i think yours are dearer okay so all the trees must come from the forest tree gentlemen i actually i actually thought this lady had the apple trees the apple trees you don't sell trees he does okay so we have fur a poplar which i've heard is very popular these days and birch i don't know another tree as charming as this one not only does it have its snow white bark but in autumn the leaves take on beautiful colors yes these are lots there are lots of growing around but lots of them get turned into fences sheds and outhouses so we might run out of these one day okay yes there are lots hang on the description on fur and poplar is the same okay so let's take one of those one of those and we can't afford that 756 we're 45 dollars short man that just sucks like a raspberry all right 45 freaking dollars okay i want to start growing some trees now we paid 750 for those i think i might plant them right here can i plant them this time of year maybe we might have to wait till spring and i'll need to hold the ground okay i don't know do we wait till spring or do we take a chance take a chance oh me oh sorry i think oh the tools aren't in here anymore clean you moved them i think what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna try planting them i think if i get them in the ground now it'll be fine if it's not we've just wasted 1500 bucks we need a ho ho ho merry christmas you need that yeah we're coming into winter coming into winter all right so what do i think actually no because we have this line of trees here um i'm putting a poplar here 375 hours interesting actually this ground's already been hoed i'm going to cut down the phone to get to me okay all right for now we're going to try one of each tree here we go here we go 375 for a fur 375 for a poplar they're the same okay interesting i've got a little bit of grass on me i'm just going to go and give it to the cows the cows to the cows not enough space all right at least then it's not wasted right it's about the gate over here you look like you're longing for a somebody else's farm cal 375 hours to grow trees man that's a long time all right what do i think we should do is go out hunting get us some meat because now that we've got better control over the time hunting is going to be a lot easier to do that's what i was thinking because in the past going out hunting could take a lot of time we'll leave some sticks in there what all right yep um bucket of water that's all smoky in this house is somebody been smoking in here we're definitely going to put more water into these stills but it's enough to get us started for now we now have five stills i guess it doesn't really make any difference which one i use actually oh no because it'll take ages anyway i was going to say we could do the raspberry mash now but no we're going to cook that all right that's off and going keep the mash oops this one's mashed all right um take these off i sold all my meat so let's do some mash we wanted a raspberry mash can i do a raspberry mash raspberry mash raspberry mash must obtain the recipe yeah that's why we're not doing it we might have to buy it we may need to buy it okay in that case let's do blueberry do they all take the same length of time i wonder um they should did i click the wrong thing cook we did blueberry don't have any apple oh oat mash we could do that one too to do our vodka we've got no potatoes okay so there is only one mash i can do today oh no i'm out of sugar oh man sugar so now that's going to be a problem too we're going to have to go and buy some sugar okay right exactly that's exactly right we need sugar so we only have 700 bucks still go can you get 700 dollars not a lot i bet you it you know i don't know about you guys i like sugar i like things that are bad for me i am actually thinking the farm might be the best place let's see what it's going to cost us rather than buying sugar let's see what the beats will cost me my spry me my spry exactly so the beats the beats are 14 each how many can we buy 50. all right sold i probably should have hung on to those other ones before but we only had three and you need four that's fine head back home what's that chicken doing in my potato patch and then what we might do is go out and do some more berry picking because there's not a lot we can do other than building fences and things and i think we go out berry picking could be a damn good idea just to get us some extra cash coming in right cook sugar from beats yeah four water oh and six beats i thought it was four that's why i sent before we didn't have enough okay we'll get some sugar going sugar takes five hours 42 the blueberry mash is about the same let's throw some more wood in there about six hours 5 58 beautiful yep all right we're gonna go hunting berry picking i could go fishing i don't know don't know i see he's playing out of ore again so yeah i think we'll we'll head up around the outside we'll do some more berry picking and if we see any animals this time we'll hunt them and we'll leave our bike here because there's junk sort this out while we're at it oh this is already done oh yes yes yes yes i recall there's something in that mountain and we need to get that out right let's grab our rifle actually let's hotkey the rifle for slot five is this thing loaded yes so sticks berries animals mushrooms this should make us a few grand berry little boys who Quantily you'll probably yeah definitely get close to winter now all the rain is starting to set in winter will be a good time to do our building oh these berries got nothing on them we must have already been in here berry picking how all these berry bushes are harvested yep we've already been in here apparently must have been last time i played more sticks in this forestry area berry bushes right here what oh in the rock face that's a cool place for a berry bush to be growing sorry just having a quick sip of my coffee all right there's another berry bush in the cliff where am i stuck on so I feel like I'm playing Hunter Call of the Wild again. Haven't played that for a few weeks have I? We might have to go on a community hunt again sometime soon. Been a wee while. What about some of you new community members? Rat Mac, have you, can you play Hunter Call of the Wild? We used to go on a bit of a community hunt together. I haven't been on one for a while. Nice relaxing game. Like this is now. Nice and relaxing. Good bit of fun going out hunting every so often. Come here. Come here. Pick an egg. No animals out here in the open? Kind of hoping I might see something out here in the open. I was hoping to find something in the open. Okay. Um. Typical. We're bringing a gun and we're not seeing any damn thing to shoot now. We're not seeing any of you. We're not seeing any of you. We're not seeing any of you. We're not seeing any of you. We're not seeing any of you. We're not seeing any of you. We're not seeing any of you. We're going to have more than enough berries to do mash. I mean, one bottle of mash. What is it? Three and a half hours in game? Three and a half hours. Well, to brew. It's actually four and a half in real life. So at that rate, you're only getting. A few bottles a day. Anyhow. So the 50 odd that we have. Could be plenty. Might be able to sell more of them. Quite frankly. Oh. Looking at the wrong tree. They were both looking red. Ah! Now. Found you. Found this earlier. But I couldn't remember where we found it. Now, this is a quest that we're on at the moment. Um. Might have to bring a spanner to it. Oh. Nope. It's ours. It's already ours. So first gear has no fuel. Okay. If that's the case, let's. Oh, I just hit the damn tree. Oh, Glenn. What did you hit the tree for? All right. Um. Can we push? No. I can't push. Can I use my physical body to push? I shouldn't hit the damn tree, should I? We were coasting downhill until I did that. Come on. Get off the tree. Might come back with some fuel. No. We'll come back with fuel. No. We'll come back with fuel. Because I'm just wasting time otherwise. All right. Where exactly are we? We're just behind the sawmill next to the river. Okay. Whoops. We're right behind the building. We should be able to easy find that. We'll get some gas. We'll come back. Grab our motorcycle. We're not lost. We just found a motorcycle. He he he he he. We're not lost, we just found a motorcycle. So I did find that earlier, as I say. But we couldn't do anything with it. Now, one of the quests that I did recently, he told me about the bite out in the bush. We discussed it, I can't remember quite how it came about. But during that quest, when I completed it, I was told we can have the bike. So that's our new transport. Bet you it'll be better than a bicycle. Yeah, we're just going to get some gas. I couldn't remember where it was. And one of the things I had in the back of my mind was let's try and find the motorcycle while we're out here. Still is out here. Get out of here. You redeveloped, youände, youANC. Why do you want to about... Fall over, you stupid pig! pig! damn pig stop running! why is this pig running away from a man with a gun? that makes no sense! why would a pig ever run away from a man with a gun? silly damn pig! you know how many berries were probably missed because of you? all over! thank you! right let's pick you up where are we going to take you to? oh we're a long way from a road free range bacon! definitely free range bacon! it's yum! nobody's ever had wild pork there's a huge difference in taste any wild animal though there's a big difference in taste when i used to breed my own chickens because they were truly free range even though i eat a lot of chicken and i love chicken when i had my free range chickens the flavor to them was so strong that i actually didn't like a roast chicken i actually had to do other things with them so i made chicken soup or chicken pie or something else because the taste was so much stronger because the taste was so much stronger because the taste was so much stronger because the taste was so much stronger i kinda wanna go and get that oh there's another pig i kinda wanna go and get that gas now don't run from me pig! oh and the deer ran too trying to get a headshot but it's not easy not when they stand side onto you damn pig stop running! i wonder if we can stick a trailer on the motorcycle i know we can stick fluffy on the motorcycle and take fluffy for a ride we might have to do that just for a bit of fun grab fluffy and stick him on the motorcycle in the sidecar of the motorcycle i know you can do that because i've seen the picture of it i'm screaming i bet you that's what that pig was thinking while i was chasing after him with a gun i was chasing after him with a gun hehehehehehehehehehe he's thinking crazy man with a gun run you want someone you want someone you want someone to stay inapped all what have we got? What have we got two pigs so far? I think we'll be alright. When we sell these berries, sell that meat. I think I'll sell the meat and skins for now. Rather than make cloves or any cooking, I think we just want some fast cash. So we can get ready for next spring. So those two trees we planted, 365 hours or whatever it said. I'm guessing that's an entire year. I'm guessing it's one year. I would be very keen to know what sort of money we can make out of them. Because forestry should in theory be a relatively good income. I don't need to know what's going on. Hopefully, yeah. I'll tell you what. We need to figure out what the best money making crop is. Because somebody asked me on the discord and it's not for that reason. But if we can figure out what the best money making crop is. Start really making some money. I do have to laugh. Because with the farmlands discord. It seems very much that the developers are quite happy to sit back and let the community just help each other. And it seems at the moment everybody seems to think. Even though it's a lie. It's incorrect. Well, it's not a lie. It's an incorrect assumption. They all seem to think I'm a professor and I know everything about this game. Far from it. Gee, I've been asking, answering a few questions on the discord and trying to help other people get problems solved that I've had. I would prefer questions came on the video. So guys, if any of you are from the discord, rather than asking me questions on the discord, ask me questions on the video. Because that helps to promote the video and the algorithm. YouTube considers it. Interaction. And leaving a comment on a video. Always helps a lot to promote that video. So if any of you ever feel like coming in and leaving a comment on a video afterwards, I'd appreciate it. And I answer all the questions. All the comments. Whether it be a question or just a comment. It helps to promote the video and the algorithm. And most people don't leave any comments on my videos. I don't know why. Maybe they think I don't leave comments. I'm not sure. But it does help greatly in the algorithm. I know one of our community members, Modball, always actually asks people to go and leave comments after the videos. I don't know how successful he is with that. All I know is it makes a huge difference. If you guys want to leave comments after the video in the comment section, I'd appreciate it. And I'll definitely respond to them. I'll see you next time. Where are we? Okay, let's take that carcass to the nearest road. Where was it? Right there. So the nearest road is that one? Yes. Where are we? Oh, one shot straight through the head. Now he's dead. That was a good shot. Even if I do say so myself. We'll come back with a trailer to collect all of these up later. Who was that other one? What's wrong with him? What's wrong with him? He seemed broken. Right, we'll pick you up, get you off the track. Put you with that one. That's a fox. We're doing alright with the hunt now. Missed. Missed. Let's get a bit closer. Don't be rude. Trying to shoot you. That's just being rude. Trying to run away. Have some manners. Fox. Lay down. I'll try and get as many as I can along this roadway. Because then it means we can just turn up later with the tractor. Pick them all up at the same time. Look at them all. Freaking awesome mate. Drop this with the other one. Two in the same spot just makes it easier. I'm going to get as many as I can along this roadway. I'm going to get as many as I can along this roadway. I'm going to get as many as I can along this roadway. Now what time is it? It seems to be getting a little dark. It's only lunch time. It might be about to rain. Now with all this extra time on our... We might actually be able to make some really good money just hunting alone. Why have you got your head buried in a tree? Let's try and get a head shot. Let's try and get a head shot. Let's try and get a head shot. I'm going to apologize. Maybe I should turn my settings down. I wonder if that would make a big difference. Let's have a quick look. Settings. And our. Iис Sorry. Right. Those elements. Exporter. Elizabeth. Okay. Yep. Man. We go down to theieldo I'm not sure what anti-aliasing does. Texture quality. I don't know. Feature quality will go down to average. See if that just helps to avoid. Some of the freezing. I've got a damn good computer. Shouldn't be freezing. But this game tends to freeze a little. Right next to the road. Perfect. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Spamming the key. And I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Spamming the key. And it wasn't picking it up. I do find sticks a little hard to pick up sometimes. The hit boxes aren't huge. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Spamming the key. And it wasn't picking it up. I do find sticks a little hard to pick up sometimes. The hit boxes aren't huge. I do find sticks a little hard to pick up sometimes. The hit boxes aren't huge. Ah, see them over there. Oh, that's a fox though. I don't have the recipe for rat soup. You've got to have recipes. You can't make things without recipes. Have you got the recipe for rat soup? You let me know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. We need the recipe first. Just like we need the recipe for raspberry mash. We need the recipe for rat soup as well. The foxes are good because you can just pick them straight up and put them in your backpack. Not that we have a backpack, but you know what I mean. Right away. Oh, I thought he was coming towards us. Thought I'd pick up a couple of sticks while he was coming towards us. Turns out he's not. I might have scared him off. Gimme gimme gimme. Where was he? Look down to pick up that. Now I've lost sight. Oh well. There was a pig there. I saw it. I think I'm getting a little heavy. Yes I am. Okay, so let's do this pig. We'll head home. Go get some gas for our motorcycle. And then we can all start to sing the motorcycle song. We'll stop freezing. Turn down the freaking settings. Turn down the freaking settings. Where's that pig going? It scared it off. Any more carcasses just here? Yes there is. Bugger! Gotta take a quick snap at him. Oh I ain't a fox. Oh straight over his head. Yeah I'll go back and get the trailer. Still over his head. Actually what I could do. Is if we put all of this down. We're going to be able to move a little quicker. We're coming back with the trailer anyway. Everything here. In one spot. What did I just hit? I think it was Q. Oh it was. Q is an auto run. Stupid fox. Stop running away! Coward! Get back here and fight like a real man. He's a real man. Says the guy shooting small animals with a gun. He's a guy shooting small animals with a gun. He's little fish. Mom culpa. Look at that round and noise. He's got a dog. Let's make it tape to this man. dafür Oh, I kind of wanted that white fox too. Kinda. Still missing that damn fox. How many times have I missed that same fox now? Barely worth the amount of bullets I spent on it. That was too low, I've been trying to get the right distance. No, stop running pig! That's not a pig, Tim. Damn fox has cost me a fortune. I'm not going to do that. He's gone now. That one fox has cost me like ten bullies. Alright, let's head home. Let's go get that gas. I feel funny sitting on the back of the bike. Where am I? I need to go left. Where's that damn fox? I feel like I'm on the back of the bike. How did that happen? I zoomed out. I'm going to change the zoom. Whoa! V button. That'll look cool. Alright, the V button. I'll leave you there. How much gas do we even have? Because we're going to need... Oh, we've got a bit. We're going to need gas for the tractor. Okay, our gun needs fixing. What is that going to take? Tools. Okay, do we still have tools in here? We're going to need gas for the tractor. Alright, let's grab the tractor. Trac-a-tac-a-tac-a-tac-a-tac-a-tah. Yep, we're good. Refuel it. Watch out if I was your chicken. Not good with this machine. Hehehehehe. Right, straight in front of us. We'll gather up all the animals that were shot. Ugh. I've got to shoot on the tractor. Missed. All right, let's just think that I'm a bad shot. Move on. Oh, come on, that was a headshot! Barret, that's just rude. Okay, so the first one is just to the right. Stop with the view! Why do I keep ending up behind it? Feels very strange being behind. Right. We might as well go down to the road and go up that way. Let's go! Let's go! Come on, old girl. Oh, do you have to keep your finger on the accelerator? Okay. See, I was thinking because it's a tractor you don't need to do that. But apparently you do. In real life with a tractor you just pull the throttle lever down to the position where you want it. What a little bit of a rod. And it'll just stay at that speed. Can I shoot through this barn? Should be able to, right? No, apparently you can't. Oh, they're running for their lives! I forgot about that. People don't like it when you pull out a gun and start shooting near them. Don't know why. It's kind of bizarre. Don't get in front of my tractor, boys. I'll run you over. Oh, you ran away too. It's just rude. Not the wrong side. Oops. Didn't mean to get on sight. Get less meat. No, it's not what I said. It's not what I said. Pick it back up. Right. Right. Now lain, if you gave me a can with a car No, that's not what I said. Pick it back up. No, that's not what I said. Pick it back up. Right. And then we'll take all these home and we'll gut them this evening. I'll butcher them anyway. Alright, just ignore the damn bullet. What the? Can you pretend to at least be dead? They're not doing a very good job of pretending to be dead, are they? I'm not sure. Is that hitting the bush in front of it? Yeah, that's six. acha delos huge? There's a dit his dog... Oh, come on. All you're doing is wasting my bullets. We definitely need that better gun. How many bullets do I have left? Only four left. Oh, well, let's use up the last of our bullets then, shall we? Where's that big white stag gone? Really wanted that big white stag. It's not actually a white, is it? But... Oh, come on! I've only got four bullets! Don't do this to me! It's rude! Get back here! Yeah, come towards me, that's it. All you guys got to see is it смож Titan Fa super grimly has粉 that... All he has to do is glue tin together. It's really about the last David21 question. it missed freaking Foxy just keeps getting further and further away all right hang on nope I'm out of ammo all right we're gonna have to spend this money on more ammo see now that I've got no ammo that Fox is not afraid of me all right where is our tractor oh there's that carcass over there too we've got plenty of meat we'll go sell the meat we'll go sell the meat we'll go sell the meat we'll go sell the meat we'll get some more bullets we've got all those berries to sell as well all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right let's move on when you trying to trip it closer Oh the lawn mowing crew are here it's gonna get noisy soon okay I can't get out I can't get up there because you pigs in the way far out nope get back here escape it's too late for that you're already being shot you're dead you do a gymnastics thing I don't mind that bag didn't fit it fitn'd it okay fine that one did so the bags aren't going on properly but there we go yeah lawn mowing crews here so it's gonna get noisy shortly oh no just put these in your inventory let them all now sitting next to the road like they feel safe just because they know I've got no freaking bullets go away okay I'm gonna have to climb up ah what is that no not close mr. climb on can you please behave ah no fell off oh come on you don't have to be difficult about this pig all right behave yourself please still trying to figure out the best way to load as many animals onto the tractor as possible because they're a little awkward to load as you can tell right you're on oh I think I know what it is I'm on the downhill slope so I'm having trouble reaching up that could be what it is can you throw it I haven't thought about that let's try throwing it oh that worked who would have thought you can throw it should have should have thought of that earlier earlier that is not climbing game okay it doesn't like that does it okay let's try throwing it on then oh there you go that'll work I think that went straight over the other side didn't it oh no not get on site oh yeah you get less meat if you go on the side nope nope can you behave please nope you're not going to I can't climb on either it's too full now I think oh it doesn't like me doing that does it beautiful I didn't hear it make a noise though so it may not be on there properly see if we can rotate it around rather than the legs being on keep hitting gut on sight not what I want it's costing us meat I'm sure it is there we go I heard that one yeah I think one of these might fall off no noise makes a noise when it goes on correctly yeah yeah you're fine you made the noise that's all that matters all right that's all about carcasses for yes Whoa! While I was looking at the map, I very nearly hit a rock. There's a few hours work here. Should be throwing them. I keep forgetting you can throw them. Can you throw? Thank you. Let's see if we can throw it right over the top. Not even close. Nope. Blinkin' mower anyway. I'm gonna get out of here. This man's going crazy. Oh, what a stat! Oh, what a stat! Oh, what a stat! Oh, what a stat! Oh, what a stat! Oh, what a stat! Oh, what a stat! Oh, what a stat! Oh, what a stat! Just seeing how much I can stack it now. Stay up there! Oh, that's rude! What do you reckon, dog? I've got all of those. What time is it? One o'clock. Oops. Alright. Oh, that might have been a bit much. Drop the boxes. Drop the gas. Now can we move here? Alright. That's all we can fit in there. It's 97. Okay. Good enough. And you've still got eight. Okay. Let's get on. Okay. Let's get on. Okay. Let's get on. Okay. Let's get on. Come on. I'm going to get on. Okay. Let's get on. Three hours. You've still got plenty of time. Oh, this is so much better with a slow speed. Getting so much more done today. Look at these animals. Freaking awesome. There's that. There's that. That bounced back. Okay. Whatever. Right. Let's go get our motorcycle. Then we'll come back and gut all of those. Run chicken! But not that way. 14 hours on the spuds. Alright. We just teleport. Fast travel. Now, hang on. So that's his farm. Motorcycle must be here. That can't be right. It was behind the sawmill. I thought it was behind Thaddeus. We did pick that fuel up. I didn't grab the fuel. I took the fuel off the tractor. Oops. Right. Let's try that again. Was it actually Thaddeus or was it the sawmill? I'm sure it was behind Thaddeus. Ruined Church. Yeah. Ruined Church. Yeah. So was it in there or over here? I don't think it was next to the ruined church was it? I'm lost. That's your fault, Daz. Because you're telling me I'm lost. I'm lost. I'm lost. I'm lost. I'm lost. I'm lost. Where was it? Yeah, exactly. I think it must have been behind the ruined church, was it? Actually while we're here. Oh, look at all this. Oh, it's only five. It looked like so much more. Oh, look at all this. Oh, it's only five. It looked like so much more. Gather all this up while we're here. Um, that thing looks like it might be a bad idea to play with. We don't have a loaded gun. Where did he go? Where's supposed to hunt that thing? Where did he go? Oh, there he is! There he is! Run! I hope he can't get in here. Freaking heck. He's in some silence. Shh, shh, shh, quiet. Now I've been up here already, but let's just take another look. Now that time has slowed down, maybe we'll see something we didn't before. Oh, I didn't mean to step down there. Where's the bear gone? That's what you usually say when all the booze is gone. Where's the bear gone? Now, did we check this? Yeah, I thought so. Can we see the motorbike from here? Nothing in the bird's nest? I want to try and ring the bell. Oh, we can get in here, but we can't ring the bell. I was thinking I wasn't going to be able to get here because I thought I'd fall down. Where is me motorcycle? Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, shit. Oh, man. I presume that bear will kill me, give it half a chance. Even a quarter of a chance. I presume. Where did he go now? Okay, well we know where the bear is. Hi, bear. We know where he is now. We can come back and try to get him later. Let's go this way and let's just run. We'll see if we can get a bravery award. Run! Oops. Probably shouldn't have done that. Is the bear following us? No. We might have lost him. We either outsmarted him or outmaneuvered him. Maybe even both. Where's that freaking bicycle? Ah, Matt. No. No. I'm at. No. We've definitely not. We have definitely not. Where's that freaking bicycle? Ah, man. No, we've definitely not... I'm sure it was near Thaddeus, wasn't it? Mushrooms. Must be over this way. Maybe I should have come back with the rifle. I do have my rifle. Oh, yeah, but I don't have any bullies. It's not going to help me. I need the bullies. I need to refill my refill. Where the stinkin' heck was that motorcycle? Can't believe I've lost it. I've lost it. Who's the bear? Ah, where was it? I really think maybe I should just go home and gut all that meat. And we'll come back when we have more bullets so I can take out that bear. I'm freaking lost, alright. Was it behind the sawmill? I'm sure it was near Thaddeus. Damn sure it was near Thaddeus. But let's head over here. Oh, guys, I haven't got my gun out today. Calm down. Whoa! Did you see that? That man can fly. Literally. Figuratively. Probably in other ways as well. Okay, here it is. Here it is. No, no, no. Refill. Now we've got a prong block. Don't crash this stinkin' thing as soon as you get it, Glenn. At least wait five minutes. It seems quite fast, actually. Let's find out in a minute when I get out onto the open. This seems quite fast actually. I'll find out in a minute when I get out of the open. I'm afraid to go fast in here though. What you idiot! It ran straight in front of the bloody bike! I don't think you can kill them can you? Far route man! What a monkey! He ran straight in front of me bike! Right, let's see what sort of speed this thing's got. Oh Glenn! Glenn! Stop! It's changing gears. This thing's not easy to ride man! This thing is not easy to ride! It slides! I don't know if I like it! Oh! I don't know if I like it! Oh! Oh! I don't know if I like it! Oh! Oh! Far route! Every little turn is quite dramatic. Plus I've found every vehicle in this game seems to pull to the blood and can laugh! I don't know why! It can be 30 kilometers per hour! 35! Look at that! 45! 42! Oh! I'm sitting down! Oh well we got it! Yeah! Even if it does feel like it's um... Crazy machine! We got it! That's the good news! Alright! And it is 1 o'clock in the afternoon! Should I... . Should I... Yeah! There's a few hours working this. Let's do this! I don't want to be up there! I don't want to be up there. Oh! I don't want to be up there! Oh! We got it! Oh well we got it! Yeah! Even if it does feel like it's a crazy machine! We got it! That's the good news! Alright! And it is 1 o'clock in the afternoon! Should I... Yeah! There's a few hours working this. Let's do this! I don't want to be up there! I don't want to be up all night doing it. See, it's 39 minutes per animal. There's about a dozen animals here. Yeah, see, it's getting dark now. So, what is that quite noisy? Ah, I'm pretty of you. We'll drop the toes Drop the meat You can thousands of fruit Why do you open up? We just got round- I'll be interested to see what time it is. Definitely getting dark. Oh, look at that. I'm glad I didn't leave it too much later. Let's turn the light on. Make sure everything is done. Let's go empty out this weight. I'm pretty sure we have one more day to sell this meat. I'm pretty sure it wasn't a complete waste of meat. We've got all the carcasses. But the meat has to be sold before the end of winter if I'm not mistaken. So we have at least one more day, I think. At least. I'm pretty sure we have to be sold before the end of winter. 58 bits of meat. Alright, let's head to bed. How are we doing for time? Two now or three hours for a day. Good day. God blimey. We're not going to get another day out of it then are we? Let's get up at 8 o'clock. I mean three hours. I could call it a day. I'm trying to sell all this meat. Okay, so let's have something to eat. Some animals will die soon. That's what happens. We'll die eventually. We all get there one day. That's why everybody should always take care of each other. Make sure that you don't hate them. Because that gets you nowhere. Let's get this out of the way. Thank you. Alright, so we're going to sell all this meat today. I'll keep the fuel because we're probably going to run out. Mushrooms. Alright, we need to buy ammo. Woof woof. Oh sorry. Dog's still asleep. Dog got it. There's more meat. More mushrooms. Let's see what we can make out of this lot. I'm going to sell these berries. Because we can't do those ones. So let's just sell them. God, that wasn't all of them anyway. Ah, it's not even all of them. Oh man, I'm so happy. Maybe. Maybe. Okay, hang on. Let's... That one didn't stack. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. Oh, true. I've never bothered to... Never actually bothered to put any of these up on the wall. Just the one. Put our fox heads above the wall. We could put... Now, deer over the bed. Now, pig up there. Right. Um... Got these. I could have sold them, but I just thought, let's decorate the house with a few. What am I stuck on? Oh, motorcycle. I left the light on all night last night. That's cost me some power. I should not have left the light on. You know the song. Don't leave the light on for me. Oh, never mind. Right. That's... What time is it? It's one o'clock in the stinky morning. What do you mean it's one o'clock in the morning? I thought I slept until a proper time. I didn't, did I? Oh, well. Can we make anything out of this? Oh, I need the string and the wall. I thought we slept through the night. I must have only slept for one hour. Oh, well. Albino set. Nice. Albino set too. Nice. We can't do the bear set. The black set. The boar set. The boar set. Hang on. No, we just need... Yep, we need more string. Okay, we're gonna make some clothes and then we'll go back to bed again. Cause apparently, I forgot to sleep through the night. But we've got some cool new winter clothing. Hang on, no we just need more strength. Ok, we're going to make some clothes and then we'll go back to bed again. Because apparently I forgot to sleep through the night. But we've got some cool new winter clothing. So the bear set, no. Black set, boar set. Three boar furs. I only have two. I have deer. I only have the deer. So deer set. Deer set. That's all we can do. Bear fur. We need potato mash for doing the spring time set. We'll get that done before spring. Summertime set. And a work set. Woah, we've got lots of clothing now. I'll go sell the rest of my fur. Rather than hang on to it. I'll sell it. Oh wait, that's not where we put in clothes now is it? Ah, should we use this one? Because it's where I put. Yeah, we'll put all of it together. Oh, we've got two of the same. I wonder if we can sell them. Never mind. Okay, so what's this? Fur cat. Fur vest. Fur hat. Well, aren't they all winter? Aren't they all winter? Aren't they all winter clothing? I'm a little confused by that. Let's go back and have another look. Yeah, maybe what we could do is actually call it a day. Because we have been going for three hours. We did the DS set. Oh, I can do more. Her vests. Her hat. Well, aren't they all winter? Aren't they all winter clothing? I'm a little confused by that. Let's go back and have another look. Yeah, maybe what we could do is actually call it a day. Because we have been going for three hours. We did the deer set. Oh, I can do more. True. And the albino set. Oh, that was the difference. I did the albino set. Right. Okay, but I don't think we can sell clothing. Let's just have a look and see if it has a value. I'm not sure if that's a value. No, it's weight and storage capacity. It's not value. Ah, okay. Yeah, I don't know if we can sell this stuff. I think what we'll do is we'll keep one of each on us and we'll try and sell them tomorrow. I probably can't. But why not give it a try? If I can start selling clothing, yeah, why not? All right. I think what we'll do, because it has been three hours and I didn't sleep a full night. And I've just noticed YouTube has started buffering. There we go. I don't know why YouTube's buffering, but I'm having a bit of a slow internet week. I have noticed that. Sometimes my YouTube pages aren't loading fully. All right. I think what we'll do is we'll try and sell all of this. Yeah, it's back again now. We'll try and sell all of that next time we play. So we'll call that it for today. Next time we come back, we've got all that and all of this stuff. We're going to try and sell all of it. We're already after midnight. So our food's not going to go off. Yeah, hopefully. That's a lot of good stuff to sell. So yes, I'm going to call that it for the day. I'll call that it for the stream. And next week when we come back, we're going to sell all of that stuff. I kind of like having that on the wall. That's kind of cool. We're going to have to start decorating our house this winter too. Yeah, so we'll be back to this again next week.
