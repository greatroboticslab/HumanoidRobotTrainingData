Education
 Dear Innovators, How are you? Do you ever think that why a professional holding a Diplomo in Agriculture or just B.S.A. Agriculture called Agricultural Extension Officer, but not a professional holding PhD in Agricultural Extension? What is an Extension? What is an Extension Service? What is Extension Education? What is an Agricultural Extension? Extension Research? What all these? Why it is needed to study Extension? From where it came to our context? Why we need to study all these? Yes, all such questions will be clarified within 10 minutes in this video. I am Dr. Sharan Chandra. Welcome to the channel Agri Innovators. Every Agricultural University in India must perform three important roles. Education, Research and Extension. Education is to develop and produce agricultural professionals to develop agricultural sector. Research is to encounter various challenges occurs while agricultural sector is development. Extension is to give knowledge of agriculture and its technologies to the people who actually practices agriculture like farmers. Let us take the Extension dimension of the University and discuss in detail. Extension, in the broader sense it is called Extension Service. This service is an educational intervention. Extension Service Providers educates the farmers about new methods of practices, new approaches for the profit and various useful agricultural information. Along with the Educating the farmers, here the Extension Service Providers can also supply them with various agricultural inputs, credits, etc. Look at the pictures provided here. Here, some of the scientists, they are supplying farmers with the new technology of poultry housing and they are supplying to the farmers. Here, one of the scientists is explaining the farmers various diagnostic methods and identifying the particular pest in a particular crop. And here, another picture where agricultural extension officers, they are trying to demonstrate various agricultural technology for the paddy to the farmers. But who will do this Extension Service? Here, some of the scientists, they are trying to demonstrate the agriculture officers, agriculture officers, agricultural extension officers, rural development officers, private sector development officers, scientists at KVK, DART centers, Sometimes, Esten professors, scientists when they visit adopted villages or any field visits like that. And occasionally, the students in the RAVE program, sometimes NSS programs may visit the fields and they can perform this Extension Service. Till now, we have covered one of the dimensions of Extension, that is Extension Service. Still, two more dimensions of Extension are there. They are Extension Research and Extension Education. Let us see Extension Research in detail. What is an Extension Research and who will do this Extension Research? We are going to see. Observe the list of focus areas of research of Extension. With the help of Extension Research, we can identify the best methods of transfer of technology. And we can study the adoption behavior of the farmers. And we can identify the farmers' interests, their suggestions and their requirements. And we can identify the suitability of a particular technology to the farming community, feasibility of any particular technology. And we can identify the different case studies. And we can report success and failure stories. The most important thing is that we can forecast the technology and we can forecast the research requirements from the farmers' side as well as from the stakeholders, different stakeholders of the agriculture sectors. And who will do this Extension Research? They are Extension Specialized Scientists at Krishiviknana Khandaras and DART Centers, Regional Agricultural Research Stations, Agricultural Colleges, and PG and PhD Students of Agricultural Extension. Let us consider another dimension of an Extension that is Extension Education. Here again two things are there. One, one thing is that the Extension Expert is equipping the agricultural professionals to perform as Extension Service Providers in the future. Again, those Extension Service Providers are involving farmers for the transfer of technology. These two things are comes under Agricultural Extension Education. So, teaching of Extension Science to the Agricultural Professionals as well as Agricultural Science to the Farmers, both things comes under Extension Education. Now tell me which subject is more important? Agronomy, it is targeting the plants, how to grow the crops. Entomology is targeting on the pests. Pathology is targeting on the pathogens. And breeding, seed technology, these are targeting about the seeds, plants, like that. But Extension is targeting the farmers and their prosperity. I am not saying Extension is the only subject meant for the farmers. Along with all the subjects, Extension is also playing a very crucial role to the development of Agricultural Sector. Actually, we should not compare subjects like these. One should have its own role for the development of Agricultural Sector. We have to consider each and every subject is very much important for the farming community. So, how can we define Extension Education? It has n number of definitions because it has very wide range of dimensions. Out of all definitions, I have picked up a common, simple definition for Extension Education. Look at that. Extension Education is a professional method of Non-formal Education to bring desirable changes in knowledge, skills, attitudes and understanding of the rural people to improve their social, economical and psychological status. We need to understand it is a non-formal education and it is an educational intervention. And here we are focusing on the socio-economical, psychological standards of the people. The term Extension we have given meaning for the term Extension in India is transfer of technology. But here we can observe different meanings of an Extension. In Dutch, it is called Urliching. In Malaysia, it is called Show Torch. UK, it is an advisory work. Germany, enlightenment. USA, education. Austria, furthering. Korea, rural guidance. France, vulgarization. Spain, capacitization. So, we have, we can give different meanings for the term Extension. But in India, we have given a meaning for the Extension is transfer of technology. So that we are mostly concentrating on the transfer of agricultural technologies to the farmers through Extension. Let us speak about some of the facts about Extension. It has started not from the agricultural universities like this. It has started in, as a university extension during 1867. Actually, availability of the knowledge and generation of new knowledge with the help of research is only consumed within the university vicinity. But during 1887, it has felt that what is the fate of outside university people. So they should also get benefited with the university knowledge. So that first time steps towards extending the university knowledge to the rural community has started. From that, the concept Extension has came into the picture. Nowadays, we are adopting this Extension subject for the agriculture, horticulture, veterinary, fisheries, forestry, dairy, home science, etc. in India. So first time in Britain, the term Extension has been used as University Extension. The person behind that University Extension is James Stewart. We can call him as Father of University Extension or the Father of Extension. During 19th century, like in UK, in USA also, Extension term has been used in the form of Extension Education. The person behind this Extension Education is JP Legans. He is also treated as the Father of Extension Education and the Father of Agricultural Extension. So far, we got to know the origin of an Extension, where it actually came into the picture, and how we have been adopted that particular Extension to various disciplines. And we have understand different roles of an experts related to the agriculture as well as Extension. And we have to perceive Extension as an educational interface to empower people. Further, we are going to learn Extension Education Process, Its Principles, Objectives and Scope of Extension. What we can expect from this course? The Basics of Extension Education, Basics of Communication. Because, Communication is the essence of Education. Basics of Teaching Methods, Knowledge on Adoption of an Innovation, Basics on Capacity Building, Agricultural Journalism, Recent Approaches of Agricultural Extension. Like that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
