 Music Over the years, demand for rice has been growing, owing to increased demand for alternative carbohydrates and progressive change in eating habits. In 2019, Kenya imported rice worth 25 billion shillings. The annual rice consumption is increasing at a rate of 12% compared to 4% for wheat and 1% for maize, which is the main staple food. Previously regarded as an orphan crop, the government declared rice an important crop to supplement maize and in 2008 launched the Kenyan National Rice Development Strategy to double rice production in the country. As the demand for rice increases, farmers are becoming more aware of the environment. Farmers like Dan from West Kano Irrigation Scheme in Western Kenya and Ngare from Moya Irrigation Scheme in Eastern Kenya have been growing rice for decades. Initially, my father is the one who was holding these farms. After he has died, I'm the one who took over from him. I have four acreage of farm and I'm doing rice. When this rice, this farm was virgin, the production of rice was, the yield was very high. And one acre was producing almost 60 to 70 bugs. But nowadays, it goes down. I've been a rice farmer for quite a long time. I inherited these farms from my father, who was the original roti. And I've grown here since I was young. And I've been doing this together with my father. Then I took over. I've done it for several years. We plant rice around August. We harvest late November and December. Then after that, we do what we call ratoon. Ratoon is when we cut the rice, another crop sprouts and we treat it just like a normal crop. And then it grows. We harvest. Then after that, our farms remain idle for quite some time before we embark on the next cropping season. These farmers are just a sneak peek into what other rice farmers have been practicing for many years. Globally, rice is known to be a key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, owing to the large volumes of fertilizers and water that rice requires. By promoting water and nutrient use efficiency, the concept plays a critical role in the reduction of these gases towards helping combat effects of climate change. The rice sector is one of the largest or the fastest growing agricultural subsectors in Kenya and actually across the world because in terms of consumption, in terms of cereals, the rice is almost overtaking maize and wheat and maize and maize and other cereals. So you can imagine how serious this particular commodity is because even of the import bill on rice, particularly here in Kenya, we are the largest importance of rice in East Africa. And therefore, the importance of rice subsector cannot be against said. And for that reason, you can imagine there is a lot of efforts geared towards rice production. And sometimes we risk doing rice intensification at the expense of the environment. And of course, you can imagine the kind of the amount of pressure rice production puts on the environment and of course, and its effect on climate because of the greenhouse gases that are produced within the rice production fields, particularly methane and other greenhouse gases. It is on this backdrop that Kilimo Trust has embarked on a journey to support the two rice growing regions in Kenya, that is Eastern and Western regions, for cross learning opportunities to introduce regenerative agriculture through sustainable rice cultivation, rotational cropping with leguminous crops and management of crop waste streams. The project is funded by a CAEL Foundation and seeks to foster public and private partnerships along this value chain. The ultimate goal is to promote the use of innovative technologies and generate evidence of developed and tested business models for scaling up as it also boosts farmers' production capacities. We came up with this particular project called Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rise initiative, funded by the IKEA Foundation of the Netherlands. And it's geared towards ensuring that there is increased adoption of sustainable rice production practices and also adopt regenerative or what you call circular economy within the subsector. According to research by Igerton University, despite Moe irrigation scheme being more intensive in comparison to Western Kenya, the yields per acre are considerably lower. But why is this a situation? What is very clear is that Moe irrigation is more advanced in the marketing, market languages and the orientation of farmers to innovations in the value chain. And therefore they have well organized marketing system. They have the farmers are highly linked to marketing processing. They have several meals up to 15, I think, as compared to Aero. Aero is not well established in terms of Western Kenya in terms of the value chain and innovations. So, but the difference is that the productivity in Western Kenya is higher. So with the intensification in Eastern Kenya where farmers don't allow the farm to rest, continuous irrigated system does not allow the soil to breathe. So continuous aboxic conditions does not allow microorganisms to survive because there is no oxygen for nine months in a year. So in Western Kenya, the farmers produce at least one crop plus an additional mini crop. So the rest of the time is a rest period for the farm. So nutrient content, the soil organic matter, the overall production system is better in Western Kenya. At the production stage, overuse of fertilizer in the fields has been a challenge. To address this, millers like Moe rice growers' multi-purpose cooperative society has adopted the urea deep placement system where nitrogenous fertilizers like urea are applied in a more efficient way. On the other hand, input providers like Margo Enterprises in Western Kenya can already see great uptick of the pelleted urea by the farmers. The nitrogenous fertilizers found in the market is in granule form. And that granule forms, or those granules, are the ones which are applied by the farmer through broadcasting. So we have realized the cost of applying and the amount of fertilizer being applied is too high. Now through the four-hour program, they have financed us to compact those granules into pellets. Thereby, reducing the amount of fertilizer being applied into the field. Of course, also reducing the cost. So when you go to apply into the chamber, we don't broadcast. What we shall do, we are going to apply them deeper into the soil through that method of urea deep placement. This fertilizer is slow release. And most of the demos that we have done is just a one-off application. After 21 days, within 21 days, a farmer applied this and it's just enough for that farmer for the whole production process. And with that, in the dairy that we have, we have increased farmer production to 30%. And now, the adoption is really coming up. I can proudly say I've already sold up to around 800 bags of this. And if you visit some of our farmers in Guanyala, in West Cano, and Ahero, we'll be able to find that now they understand the use of pelleted urea as a way of increasing rice production. In addition to improved fertilizer application, the project is also intensifying adoption of crop rotation, where farmers intercrop with leguminous crops like green grams, which are excellent for nitrogen fixation. When we are doing crop rotation, the yield starts to grow up again. We do green grams. After green grams, we do rice. When we put rice, when we put green grams, we can even get more money. Like the one I did, myself I did, I get a lot of money from the green grams. It supported me in school fees, even in some other things. It helped me a lot. Beyond the rice grain, rice husks and straws are the main by-products in rice production. The straws contain silica, which takes much longer to decompose, leaving farmers with limited options on how to utilize them. They end up either being burnt or fed livestock despite their low nutrition value. To address this, the R4i CSA project in partnership with Egerton University has piloted vermicomposting, where red worms are used to break down the straws into rich organic manure and vermic liquid, which farmers can use on their farm or even sell. The straw from rice has got a lot of silica. There is an uptake of silica in the straw and therefore they cannot easily be biodegradable. The worms play a very important role. They introduce hydrolytic enzymes into the straw. So we mix together with the organic matter from cow dung. And within a period of 60 days, all this straw has been biodegraded through the mechanisms of hydrolytic enzymes. And also the red worms are very, very active. They feed also on this. And within a short time, if you leave them in the farm without doing farm composting, you will come back after 90 days and you still get it as hard as it is without breaking down. So that is why you see most of the rice production systems. One of the biggest problems is what to do with the straw. Rice husks, on the other hand, have been a menace to millers for a very long time. They account for the bulk of waste at the point of milling. In a period of one month, we are able to mill exactly about 8,000 kilograms. And out of 8,000 kilograms, rice husks is about 800 kilograms. We had a challenge, particularly on the space for keeping this rice husk. Because 250 metric tons is much, much, much husk. And we used to burn that husk initially. But due to the population growth and the scarcity of space, particularly in Moya, we don't have any space where we can take this husk and burn. But tables are turning. Rice husks are now becoming a sought-after input in production of diverse products from fabrication of stoves that use rice husks, carbonation of husks for production of organic fertilizer to rich organic material for tree nurseries. The opportunities are many. We started working on this innovation because when you walk around you find a lot of waste that are just dumped outside. And most of you were propelled by the amount of waste that was coming out of Kisumu town. And so you were seeing the dump site, which has been a very big problem even to the government on how to dispose the waste. So we realized that a lot of waste that were being disposed there are combustible waste. And so we were thinking on a way on how we can turn this waste into energy. And that's why we came up with this kind of stuff that then could be used to burn that waste to energy and at the same time help in management of those waste. This innovation is gradually taking shape with women adopting it as an alternative to using firewood.

In Moya, meet Waweru with a team of over 10 youth who have learned how to add value to rice husks. Kilimo Trust has helped create linkages for them with Moya rice growers where they get the rice husks for carbonation to make biochar. The biochar is ready to use for farmers as mulching material but it doesn't end here. Kilimo Trust has linked Waweru with Safi Organics, an organics fertiliser manufacturer which uses the charred husks for production of organic fertilisers. Initially actually we were doing the whole process here. So we would do the carbonisation here. But now we realised that it is one of the bottlenecks and definitely was taking quite a lot of time and also limiting our capacity. So what happened is we chose to look for people to work with and people we can train on how to convert the rice husk into biochar. So and one of the things that happened interestingly then Kilimo Trust was also in the picture. So we brought people like Waweru on board. We have about six teams that are doing that for us. And the good news is that these people are able to earn a good income from the venture which would otherwise have moved to urban centres to look for jobs. So we are reducing that. In directory we say at Safi Organics we are employing about that huge blockery. With Eastern Kenya having intensified value addition, companies like Lake Bezin Agritech are working towards knowledge transfer in the western region. So the cost of producing rice is too high and most of that cost is actually taken by a fertilizer. So this is the reason why we decided to look for which are the cheaper ways of improving soil fertility in rice production. And we also learned from our colleagues in Moaya, Safi Organics which was already in the field of biochar production. So our intention was to replicate the same in western Kenya because we had seen the impact that biochar had in rice fields in Moaya. Already, Vincent and his team have introduced biochar to tree nursery owners given that the charred husks can be used solely on plants owing to the high nitrate and moisture retention capabilities. So we went to theTurn. Soil yapa inakuangata inaile rutuba, ya kutosua yenye inaesabu fanye mimea. Ifanyanini? Imee... mzuri. So... Tulikuwa natuaribu kutumika alta... Mambo ya ii west ya Ngombe. At least kama iteza. Iteza tusaidia, lakini tukakuja tukapata bado. Inaumiza mimea. So, lakini wakati wenzangu walitembelea apa wanyo anatoka kwa ika mbuni. We will be able to make it a little bit. When we are able to make it a little bit, we will be able to make it a little bit. But when I saw it and saw it, I will be able to make it a little bit. Going forward, as all these interventions take shape, cross-learning opportunities will be critical to scaling up and transforming rice farming to become more sustainable, given its important role in addressing food, nutrition security and improved incomes for all the value chain actors.
