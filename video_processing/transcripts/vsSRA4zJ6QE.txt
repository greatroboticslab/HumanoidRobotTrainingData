 I made the largest control bar possible in fish. Here is how I did it. I compared every single rod and found that the rod with the largest control bar was the no-life rod. Next, I took my no-life rod to keep his altar where I enchanted it to control. There is unfortunately no bait in the game that increases the size of your control bar. Now if I fish, this is the largest possible control bar possible in fish. Subscribe.
