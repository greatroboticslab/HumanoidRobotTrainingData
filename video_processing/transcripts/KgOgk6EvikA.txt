Education
 Swoyam Prabha Digital India Educated India Let us start this lecture with the thought process that all of you are here to learn, right learning is a process and we should have love for learning. So, I always feel that love for learning lessons the labour pains of learning. Today learning is a very difficult process for all of you, right because you people are occupied with several other things and therefore, it is very important you should develop a love for it and learning is a part and parcel of human life. Let us recall what we learnt in the last lecture. We basically looked at that why we need to go for agriculture as a basis for our growth, and why because you know like we are having a naturally endowed with the resources which are very conducive and you know for the agriculture or the farming. And later on we looked at like what are the processes involved in agriculture and how this modern agriculture being implemented as of now, right. And today we will be looking at what are the problems we are facing with the modern farming and you know like in 1950s or the 60s you know like we are having green revolution people are very much where gaga about it and today also some of the you know intellectuals are very saying that we need to go for second green revolution. Is it really revolution or not that we will see and I will I will put forward or I will show you some data to it. But let us before that let us look at what are the problem in the modern agriculture. We use more fertilizers and more pesticide for what? Because more fertilizers will give the growth will be better and then you know production of the crop will be higher and more pesticide will have to give because the pest or the are more increasing at a number. Because as a result that we are more profit maniac you know we are want to have a more greedy, greed, greediness has come to our mind too much, right. And there is a whole wall not only in India because of this is what you call materialism. I as I told earlier market materialism makes a man maniac. So we became maniac you know like for profit, maniac for grabbing all those things are going on in our mind. So, what is the what you call deterioration of mind power to think which is right which is wrong getting swayed away. So therefore, that is the problem and then it is thrust upon us and we are just not thinking about one and pest and diseases are part and parcel of nature. Keep in mind that because one person will be relying another, right and they balance and so also disease is the thing to decay and then you will be going. So, this is the part of nature. In ideal system natural balance between predators and pest are to be maintained. So that you know each are connected with each other. These are all philosophy what our embedded in our you know traditional knowledge system in our ancient wisdom. And which we need to understand the basic things what we are talking about here. You need to understand the basic laws of nature and then work accordingly not going against and you know imbalancing or doing something that balance will be broken. Balance is important because we cannot really look at only small micromanagement the whole big picture we need to look at it. And big picture are very order and then it may be looking like a disorder, but actually as I told that our civilization order in disorder and that is natural. So, that has to be looked at it. So chemical control that is why we want to have a control over this diseases and also the pests. So, that last 40 years you know insectized use have increased 10 fold. While the crop losses from the pest damage have doubled losses are increasing and you are increasing that also right insectized. So, one has to look at that why it is so and as a result the safety of the people 1 million cases of poisoning by pesticide each year around the world and up to 20,000 of these results in death this poisoning because of and this number may be more I mean like you know. And that is occur in tropical countries where chemical pesticides which are banned in Europe and other western countries like USA are still being used in India right. I mean there are several examples I am not going to look at it and you can see your for example, DDT and then some other thing even urea people are not, but we are using it here. So, and cost of farming increasing at alarming rate and as a result food prices are also being increased very much around 300 percent in last 10 years and if you look at we are having a people who are hands to mouth like hands to mouth laborers and where they will get the food. Because the food prices are now is comparable to the global market and earlier days food was very cheaper in this country. Whenever I visit other country I feel oh we are safe we are having at least food a common person can get today it is not because of globalization and you know right. And problem with the industrial agricultural practice here I have already discussed let me just highlight some of the points I will be highlighting more again because I want that some of the things will be repetitive in nature, but keep in mind these are important we need to understand that then only we can take characteristic. As I told that monocultures basically the single kind of crop they use and that erodes the biodiversity among both plants and animals. It is not only with the plants only because all are connected. So, therefore, that is creating and if you look at the nature is always multi layer or you know various things it is not heterogeneous it is not homogeneous. We trying to make it homogeneous because in engineering we do that you know, but that is not that is a wrong cause it is not easier to handle the heterogeneous thing you make it homogeneous. Therefore, you say that no it nature is other way around it is your limitation that you are trying to push forward or the you know thrust upon the people, but you must understand that nature is not like that. And there is a strength in that synthetic chemical fertilizers are being used blatantly which pollute the soil not only the soil water and air all whatever the environment we are getting spoiled because of this blatant use of chemical fertilizers. I will be showing how it is so and both environment and although not only the human health, but also the animal health, plant health you know all are being connected. So, soil which is the soil of infinite lives right and that is getting spoiled you know much faster than it can be replenished. And taking with its lands fertility the whatever the fertility nutrients the land the soil is having it is going away and which are very important this fertility and nutrients are very important for the growth of the plants and those things we eat as a food, but those are being getting away you know. I will be showing you later on like what are the things and I will also give you data how this most of the civilization got extinguished got spoiled because of soil quality is going down at that time. We need to keep that and maybe in the next class I will show you some data. And water is consumed at unsustainable rates in many agricultural areas because water being used too much and it is also helping to take away or leaching out the what you call this fertility and nutrients which you are adding to the soil artificially and also the natural one all are going away. So, you know you are using because of too much use of water. So, effect of pesticides on environment if you look at chemical pesticides can kill useful insects there is a lot of you know microorganism insects are very useful pollination for pollination you need, but they are not you know and if pollination would not be there then you cannot have a food production you may have very big plants, but you do not have. Nowadays in western country people are using artificial pollination you know like why you will do that and cost is will be increasing which ate the pest leading to the imbalance in nature whole mother nature is in balance you are cutting the limbs of and you know fingers or you know if you look at a body my fingers are being cut my you know hand being removed from the mother nature you know mother nature if you consider it as a body that is not the way. So, therefore, you need to look at it and as I told earlier artificial chemical can stay in environment in the body is for a number of years right even if you would not use it will stay for you in your thing for generation to generation and you cannot really afford to do that and causing problem for many years it is not for your generation it is for the next maybe 5 10 generation will have to suffer because of you have used the chemical fertilizers and which are not good for the health. So, therefore, we need to understand insect pest are very quickly or over a fear of breeding cycles they become resistant to artificial products. They also try to resist the thing and develop a hormones and other things so that they can because that is the nature nature is intelligent you know they are working to go suppose somebody will try to heat you you will have to protect yourself you know right find out ways and means use your mind use your body use your resources use your power to do that they are also doing that way ok and are no longer controlled by the label of chemicals what we you were using earlier days I will be showing you some data as well. So, if you look at fertilizer consumptions you look at this in 1960s we are having fertilizer consumption is very very low if you look at this is the color orange color that brown is very very low million tons maybe you know like one or two million tons and it is goes on increasing and so also china and then we are because we want to grow at a faster rate than the other people and that is the bigger problem. But if you look at America which is a very intelligent people you know like they have grown this a higher increase from 1960 to maybe 80s they realize these are not good and they are almost remaining constant and sometimes going negative and I do not know the data last may be 6 7 years. But I am sure that they might have decreased it. So, if you look at we need to do that we will have to cut off and then the whole business you know they are sending their multinational component to here to swindle us and users and then spoil we will be intelligent you know we should understand this and then do that. So, if you look at we are as we are using more fertilizers and more pesticides and other things we are spoiling also the ground water. I was told of course, this may not be the correct but you please check do not go by any data I am giving please correct it check it and then accept it. In some newspaper this thing I learned that 60 percent of ground water in China are not drinkable. In India you think about it my guess is around maybe 20 to 25 percent of the at least in Kanpur I know there is a some area where the water has gone ground water has gone bad deadly bad. So, therefore, we need to and worry about that because that sustains the life and if we spoil the ground water and which are interconnected how we are going to what you call correct it or how we are going to replace how we will do that can you take it out by the pump and again put it is it possible all are connected you know like interconnected right. So, how we will you know take care of that polluted water. So, therefore, we will have to worry about and if you look at the fertilizer consumption I know nitrogenous there is a phosphatic type and potas potasic type it is all are increasing you know in 1991 where something 80 in lakhs tons you know this is in lakhs of tons 80 lakhs tons now one in 2000 say in 166 and today may be it will be something 175 or may be 80 I do not know ok you please look at it. So, all are increasing we should decrease it we should at least stabilize it you know because we know it is they are harmful but still because our people are illiterate and then so also the thing and the people are using advertisement and other thing to what you call lure them for this for the more production and more profit as a tool to imbibe them you know right lure them but all our we are spoiling the health. Let us look at how is the food production related to fertilizer consumptions right. So, if you look at that this is I have taken the data from 70 to 2002 it is a little old data but let us look at the trend. This blue color is fertilizer consumption rate it is going up sometimes in 75 it is gone up above the red line that is corresponding to the million tons of food production. And then if you look at it is food production is lowered down at least 95 onwards and the fertilizer consumption is increasing. And let me tell you last year I had gone to some nearby village in Kanpur where people are you know and then I enquired with the farmers I told what are the consumption they are saying that we are using almost double the fertilizers what we are using 10 years back for getting the same you know tonnage for acre kind of a crop. See look at what we are doing that means the soil fertility has gone down and you are adding more and more and then it will be spoiling right. So, therefore, the farmer committing suicide because the cost of farming is increasing at an alarming rate than the what price they can get in in the you know what you call market. As a result you know they are in debt therefore, government of India is you know what you call taking away their debt in the sense giving the what you call subsidies no not subsidy it is like. Waving of the loans. Waving of the loans. Waving of the loans, but that is not the solution. Solution has to be found out looking at what are the causes of it and then look at fundamentally and solve the problem. And there all of you who are listening to this lectures and then you will have to come into picture and educate them and also educate the government about this wrong policies of using these concepts. Because you know we are democracy we should do that. And the growth is and we are all talking about the green revolutions and other thing we want to have another green revolution people are talking about genetically modified crops and I am afraid one should not venture to that. Of course, there are several reasons I will be not talking about why you need to, but you will have to if you are interested get into that and find it out yourself. So, the growth rate of the crop production let us look at what happened in our the green revolution. So, let us look at that this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 in this diagram for the wheat. We are talking about pre green revolution something from 1951 to 1968 we are having something 37 you know is the tons of this. So, this I have taken the data from the draft of 12 plan document daily planning commission and 2013 right. So, let us say this is the percentage you know what you are having then it has been decrease in the green revolution period 69 to 81 ok. And then it is again little bit increase of and then going down and then down again this thing then again people are increasing because of in the seventh plan and that is true with if you look at this point you know for the rice for the wheat and then pulses for oil seeds of course, oil seed has little bit gone up I mean corresponding to this 1951 and in the in the today kind of today means 11 and 12, but wheat and rice and pulses you know it is lower than that what it was there in pre this thing. So, therefore, you can judge from yourself and this data I have taken from this thing that look this is is a myth that we are having a green revolution ok. Because the crop we are putting lot of pesticide lot of fertilizer and this thing, but we are not growing I mean of there is a various fluctuation depending upon your what you call your climates and there is depending upon other parameters you know that is there. So, one has to look at data and analyze it and then only we can say that look there is a green and beside this we are paying price for the what for this use of this chemicals fertilizer pesticides spoiling soil air and the thing we will be talking about what are the problems of chemical fertilizer let us understand that and there is a micro nutrient imbalance because of utilizing the chemical fertilizers because we know that chemical fertilizers contain nitrogen phosphorus potassium which are micro nutrient these are the micro nutrients you know you can think of and excess use of fertilizers micronutrients. So, the soil you are giving artificial soil will be imbalance may be you are adding more than what is required. So, excess of anything is bad right you need to know that what are the things and there will be also imbalance because of root will be taking and then it will be not taking all the thing it will be remaining. I will be talking about later on about you know like root how they take and what will be the size of roots if we use chemical fertilizer if we use natural farming all those things I will be talking about little bit later on particularly when I will go to the natural farming. Excess is a particular affect the soil fertility adversely and also the productivity as I told just now that which my own experience talking with the farmers nearby the Kanpur area. They are saying they are using large number of you know large amount of fertilizer for the same amount of crop production in the same land right over the years and that is true that you can see I mean you can ask anybody and you are having also data nowadays internet you can get the data and maybe from reliable source because the internet one has to be careful about data right you can go to the government sources some other things then you can find it out what are the conceptions you know I have shown you already that. So, there is a nitrate pollution like excess nitrogen nitrogenous fertilizers leach deep into the soil because you are using a lot of water also irrigation you know like and there is a ground water you are using using the pump you know power right electricity and then diesel and the lift irrigation system has now come up right and you just press a button and then water will be spread over this thing. So, and it is sometimes I have seen at least in the nearby Kanpur area that is they use a lot of water unnecessarily and that can contaminate the ground water also and that is happening in lot of areas and other water pod is nearby is being spoiled by the you know nitrosis fertilizer and if the concentration of nitrate in the drinking water exceeds 25 milligram per liters it affects mortality rate and the low weight of the newborn babies which is basically these you know low weight and I think known as a blue baby syndromes right and which is showing I will show you a diagram may be next slides that and blue baby syndrome refers to at least two situation one is cyanotic heart means you know there will be heart arteries which will be you know big thicker and then I will be thinner that problem will be there and this methamoglobinemia that means like anemia you know like blood will be less and then now it will be little bit different than that. So, this causes a problem in the blood itself. So, you can look at this term I am not you know sure about that but you look at that. So, what is that I mean this is causing problem which will be with the baby itself you know then where you will go right. So, these are very serious problem of the blue baby syndromes and there is another problem which come eutrophication. Eutrophication basically when you use excess fertilizer that can pass to the nearby water bodies. And as a result this there will be over nourishments in this pond water bodies and which is known as eutrophication because the over nourishment if over nourishment will be there then what will happen that the algae you know there will be lot of growth in algae at the faster rate. And then they will grow very rapidly right and then again they will die and then as a result because their life is short and they die and pollute the water affecting the aquatic life adverse that you might have seen that in your you know observation if you are having good observation. See the cause is this one. So, therefore, these causes and that is the problem. If you look at this pesticide there are two kinds of pesticide people use first generation pesticide use sulphur, arsenic, lead and mercury to kill pest. Look at these are all you know dangerous you know elements one should have at it but we are using. The second generation of course, the DDT what is is dichlo diphenyl tri chloro ethene used to kill the pests and these pesticides are organic nature of course, but pesticides protect our crop from severe losses due to pest but they have several side effects you know you can think of there are several side effects it should not be used as such. And side effects of pesticide as I told that basically that of non target organisms suppose you want to kill X but now you will be killing YZ and you know other things and which are beneficial. So, several insectide kill not only the target space but also the several beneficial and organism which are not of target. And as I told that after you know use this pest several times the people those are also living organism they try to resist and certain pest of course, certain things may not resist properly but certain pest that could manage to survive became highly resistance to all kinds of pesticides you know and though these pests are called as super pest like super man you know they became super pest. So, and bio magnification is another thing most pesticide non biodegradable right it is not it cannot be degraded by the soil or other things. So, get into food chain which is known as bio accumulation it will getting accumulated and these pesticides in bio accumulation form are harmful to the human beings and we as I told it will remain for your body chain you know chain food chain for several time also in your own body right and it will be transmitted you know various forms. And surface and ground water pollution you know like toxicity to aquatic wildlife and human through drinking waters right all those things. Risk of cancers like pesticide enhances the risk of getting cancer in two ways. It acts as a carcinogen also and it indirectly spoil the immune system. You might be aware there is a train known as cancer train which is originated from Punjab. You are aware all of you there is a train all cancer that is a person will be coming you know that is why people call it cancer because they in Punjab or Yana region they are using these pesticides and fertilizers to larger extent. They can say the rice what you call wheat bowl or the food bowl of India, but they are really spoiling their own health and giving us food and that is also not of good quality. So, I will stop over here and we will be looking at the what you call disadvantages or the of the using this modern farming in the next lecture and later on I will tell about like what is the quality of food we are using and then we will be looking at basically why we need to go for the ancient technology for the agriculture. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for being here.
