 All right, I just wanted to bring you in here real quick. I can do a comparison of the plants that I transplanted the other day. Sorry about my dirty hands, just got finished planting carrots. But that one's really up next to the third digit right there. As you can see, it's not really grown out very much. Look at those, still down at the first digit. Maybe I'll give that the second digit right there. Let's go outside and check out the transplant. Now, if you look at that one, I mean, it's grown out significantly. Another one right there has grown, look at that, up to the third digit easily. It has grown out significantly as well. And then this one didn't grow up very much, but it definitely grew out. You can see the new growth in the middle in there. And this is definitely the part of gardening that I love the most.
