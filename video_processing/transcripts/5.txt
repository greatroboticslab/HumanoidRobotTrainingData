 I just love vegetable gardening and I like a little bit of a garden with a theme. You know I grow a salsa garden, but what about a BLT garden? Yeah, that's what this is right here. I have some beautiful little lettuce you can see here. Perfect timing for us to do a little bit of harvesting. And I take my nippers, or you can use your scissors, or you can just break them off with your hand. And you can just break them off and just, you don't want to pull them all the way out by the root. Don't do that. Don't pull out all of the roots. We'll plant that back in. But if you use some kind of a scissor or your nippers and just clip it off, and that's just some fresh greens right from your garden. Those will go on the sandwich itself. And now, let's check out our tomatoes. Now we planted these in late March. And you can see we have some beautiful green tomatoes coming on already. A nice size. Look at that. And we have quite a few on this vine. Even a few more blooms here. And you can see these yellow little flowers. Those are the blooms of those tomatoes. So you want to make sure that when you have your tomatoes growing, you want to put a stake in the middle of that plant. And then you can see here, we've used a little bit of a wire that we just have, a recycled piece of wire from our garage. And we wrap it around the strongest part of that stem. You can see right there. And you can just tie it right to the stake itself. Once these really start to grow tall, they get kind of heavy. So you really want to give them a little bit of support. Another thing I like to do, this little cluster right here, it's almost too many tomatoes there right now. I'm going to take off a few of these little babies. Don't tell my dad. And because, you know, you want some of these tomatoes to grow a little bit bigger. So I'm thinning this. See this little cluster? I'm going to thin it so I only have like three or four in a little cluster. Take out a couple more of these blooms. That way I can have a nice big slice of tomato on that BLT. So where's the bacon? Well, I'll have to go get that inside. And in the meantime, I'm going to do some fried green tomatoes. So get out there and get growing.
