 . Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to share with you some information on my strawberry variety update. This will probably be the last discussion on these combinations of varieties that we've been looking at. This is a five-year study, so we've been able to, I think, get enough information out of these varieties. But first of all, as we all know, that strawberry production has increased throughout the nation, and it's increased in Alabama also, be it through increased consumer awareness of health-promoting qualities of strawberries, or just the fact that they're just plain good to eat. And not only have we seen an increase in production overall, but an increase in the number of households that are purchasing strawberries. So this is a pretty good thing for the strawberry industry. But the most productive varieties that we have are from the from California breeding programs and from Florida breeding programs. And so it's especially important to determine how these varieties perform in our environment, since strawberries are very environmentally sensitive. And so, but, and there's little documented information concerning the performance of these strawberries, as well as the quality. As I mentioned earlier, the consumer awareness of health-promoting qualities weigh into the purchase of these strawberries. So we're looking at both yield performance, as well as the quality. All right. So the objective, determine production potential, as well as the antioxidant concentration of selected strawberry cultivars, in order to enhance the sustainability of strawberry industry in Alabama. All right. So this, as I mentioned, was a five-year evaluation. We planted on an annual plastic culture system. As the name implies, it is an annual system. It's taking a perennial plant and making it, using it as an annual plant. We used black plastic mulch and we used black plastic plants. We used black plastic plants. We used black plants. We used black plants. We feel that black plants are a lot easier to use. And they're a lot more forgiving if you make mistakes. All right. And these are the varieties that we've used. As I mentioned that this will probably be, and hopefully, be the last discussion on this particular combination of varieties. I think we have enough information to determine how well these varieties will perform, at least in central Alabama. We are looking forward to getting a new group of varieties. And we won't abandon these altogether. There will be some that we'll use just as sort of comparison to some of the new varieties. So what data did we collect? We looked at the plant size and stolen number. What is the significance of this data, plant size and stolen number? Plant size is an indicator or can be an indicator of yield overall. Plants that are larger tend to produce more fruit, although there's some conflicting data in the literature that would suggest otherwise. But plant size can also play a role, especially if you are in a pick-your-own operation, where we have an increase in plant size. You can have an area at a time where you're not able to really see the plants or see the fruit that growers, not growers, but customers are unable to see the fruit. And so that leaves fruit behind and just left to be an inoculum for fruit disease. So it becomes a management issue. Stolen number, those of course you know that leads to the stolons lead to daughter plants. And in an annual plasticulture system, the number of stolons isn't as important. It becomes more or less a detriment in this system as opposed to the matted rose system, which is a perennial system. And it's driven by the daughter plants. But in this system, we really don't want a whole lot of stolons. So that becomes a management issue. So we looked at that. We're also looking at yield, both early and total. And as I mentioned, fruit quality. We tend to look at soluble solids as the main indicator of fruit quality, soluble solids or sweetness as the main indicator of quality. But there are some other aspects of the fruit that play into the flavor profile. Antioxidants may be one of them, but antioxidants have another role. There are cancer-fighting agents. So first off, we'll start with the strawberry size. And Camarosa, as we can see, Camarosa is a pretty large plant. And as I mentioned, this can be an issue when you have a UPIC operation. The customers are going to go to the fruit that they see. And oftentimes, they leave a lot of fruit behind. And it's left as inoculum for disease. And it also causes the grower to have to send his workers out into the field to sort of clean up and find those fruit and harvest those. So that's an added cost. And the larger the fruit, the larger the plant, it also is an indicator of, well, it can be a problem when it comes to spraying pesticides. So you have a better coverage if you have more space between the plants. And we can see Camino Real. It is a much smaller plant, a significantly smaller plant, produces really nice compact plants. There is talk about maybe taking advantage of this space that's left by these smaller plants and increasing the plant population. But most growers would probably just leave that space there so that, especially if they have a UPIC operation, so that they can get better pesticide coverage as well as increased visibility of the fruit. Okay, so that brings us to the number of stolons. And we can see that Ruby June produces significantly fewer stolons than all of the others. We can see in 2020. And I will point out, though, that in 2020, we took these measurements later in the year. And in 2021, we took them pretty early. But you can see that there's, with Ruby June in 2021, there's really not a column there. There is data there, but it can't be seen on columns. So it just shows you how low the production of stolons are in Ruby June. Now, if you were planting Ruby June in a matted rose system, this could be a problem. But in an annual hill plastic culture system, this works pretty good. Now we can see that Camino Real along with, and Camarosa along with being, well, Camarosa along with being a large, relatively large plant, it also produces a number of stolons per plant. So this leads us to the yield, berry size and cull. Camino Real and Ruby June were both the most comparable to Camarosa. Both had lower cull fruit number and as well, and the berry sizes are tended to be comparable to Camarosa. And then some years, especially Ruby June, those fruit can be a little bit larger than Camarosa. Camino Real, there's been an issue, though, with the, I don't know, I'm talking about yield here, but I'll inject here with flavor. Camino Real tended to, tends to have a reduced sugar or reduced flavor. And that has been a problem in the past. But some growers said that they didn't notice it. And their clientele even say that the berry is really, really good. Ruby June, on the other hand, produces a very tasty berry. It's not, the yield is not quite there, but compared to Camino and Camarosa. But it produces a pretty tasty berry. Unfortunately, the yields aren't quite as, as high as those others. So this leads us to quality. I got a little ahead of myself, though, when I start talking about sweetness. I'm going to add a little bit more. But the sweetness of Camarosa or Camino Real does tend to be a little low. Camino Real has, and it has a corresponding low soluble solids. But I will mention that Ruby June tends to have, can sometimes have low soluble solids. And even when it has soluble solids that are low, lower than the rest, it still has great flavor. So there's more playing in the flavor than just the soluble solids. There's some other components in that flavor profile that's providing that excellent flavor. So in summary, starting with plant size, Camino Real was smaller. It was slightly more comparable to Albion, but it's slightly smaller than Albion. As I mentioned, growers could take advantage of this compactness of the fruit, of the plant by maybe planting them a little closer. But I think that most growers will probably take advantage of this and allow this to remain as a way of increasing the visibility of the berries. Ruby June had low stolen number. And this, again, can be a great management benefit, reduction in costs, hopefully, and production in labor. These, it is recommended that the stolons be removed once they start because they will hinder the yield. And so with Ruby June, there's not as many stolons that have to remove, as opposed to Camino Real, which was among the highest stolons, at least when the stolons were counted later in the season. Camino Real and Ruby June are most comparable in yield to Camarosa, as well as they are also comparable to Camarosa in berry size. Camarosa in berry size. Both had lower cull fruit, which is again another management benefit in management. That's fewer fruit that have to be taken out, have to be picked through and increasing the labor costs and time dedicated to this and dedicated and taken away from other things, other activities in the operation. Camarosa in berry size. And soluble solids varied throughout the season, well, throughout the five years. But Ruby June still had excellent flavor, regardless of the soluble solid content. And one thing that we noticed in anthocyanin content is that the anthocyanins tended to run a little low in Ruby June. And this could play into the fact that, you know, as consumer awareness grows, they're going to be more interested in compounds like this in berries and breeders are more interested in this and in trying to increase this for higher concentrations in berries. So in conclusion, plant characteristics yield and fruit qualities indicate that Camino Real and Ruby June offer potential alternatives to Camarosa in Alabama. And I will say that maybe Camarosa, Ruby June to a lesser degree, I think in fields where you've got a few more stresses, both Camino Real and Ruby June probably won't do as well as Camarosa in terms of yield. But Camino Real tends to be a little more comparable to Camarosa even in those situations. Ruby June tends to drop off a little bit because it is a little less adapted when you have those more challenging environmental factors. So some points to remember. Flood versus bare root. I like flood plants. As I mentioned, these are better. They're more tolerant to mistakes. And we do make quite a few. And so I think it's beneficial to get these. These are a little more expensive. But some growers really like working with bare root plants and they work well for them. So one thing to remember is that these new operations, you know, as Ed Sikora mentioned, you know, we kind of have an issue with the number of operations providing plants. But the operations that we deal with now, they have a minimum order. So you have to be up, just ask them up front, you know, what that minimum order is and how much do you pay up front. Some require maybe half the cost, half the total cost of the berries. And one thing to remember is if at all possible, do not delay in placing your order. Place your order as soon as you can as soon as they are available. This will help you to not only get the types of berries that you want, but also the number of berries. And if you wait too late, you may not be able to get any at all. So now is the time. Actually, it's getting a little late. So if you have not ordered, if you know growers who have not ordered, you know, encourage them to go ahead and place their orders. And Camino Real and Ruby June, you know, they have been used in, or at least I know Ruby Camino Real has been used in, in operations when, in years where Camarosa wasn't available. And the growers had a pretty good experience with Camino Real and, and to some degree Ruby June, to the point, to the, to the point of not, or, or kind of swapping Camino Real or Camarosa for Camino Real, because their clientele said that they're, they're, they're delicious. They think they're delicious and they're just product, just as productive. And in some cases, even more so. Again, order on time, test soil early, and provide yourself with timely bed preparation so that you can get your plants in the ground earlier. Early planning or timely planning is, is, is critical, I think, in getting really good yields. So this is a list, our current list of strawberry plug producers. We have Dixie Green in Alabama. We did have Greenway plants, but I understand, Greenway plants in Aniston, but I understand that they are no longer producing plants. And we have an out of state list here. But if you, if you don't have this list and you need this list, please just contact me and I can, I can provide it for you. So that's the end of this presentation. Hopefully next year, I'll have another slate of varieties and I will answer any questions that you may have with this current set of varieties. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
