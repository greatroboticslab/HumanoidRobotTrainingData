 Music Hi, I am Penny Adler and my grant title is on the screen. It's making goat's milk soap business sustainable by implementing standard manufacturing and testing protocols. And just to kind of talk about it, I am a small farmer by Watertown, South Dakota. We raise goats and I make soap. One of the cool things though that we're doing is we're doing a new product and I, see if I can show you, but this is the cream soap, it's soap in a jar. So it's not bar soap, it's just something totally different and it's pretty unique. There are very few people that do it. So what's unique about it is the lather. And you can play with this lather and it'll go and go and go. So I just kind of want to show you that lather because that's part of the uniqueness of the product. The other part of the product though that I'll show you, and I'm making a mess here, is that this is my batch. And you can see it should be nice and brown and it should not have this. So I had a failed batch. And so that's kind of how this got going for the grant was because I love my product. I don't love failures. And then the other part of it is, is I always want to be natural. So our tagline is wholesome living in a colorful world. We make colorful soaps, but we also like wholesome soaps. So the question was, is can I make cream soaps 100% natural or what do I need to do to make it safe for my customers? So that was kind of the impetus for the grant. So I'm going to give you a little bit of advice. In the end I wanted a consistent safe product. I wanted to be sound financially, lower my costs, or know my costs, lower my costs. And then also because I'm excited about doing this, I wanted to be able to market that, hey when you buy from me you know what you're getting a consistent safe product. Our goals are... these were the four product goals from our grant. I'm going to today talk to you about the first one create manufacturing and testing protocols If you like what you hear I would love to talk about the other ones So you can always invite me back, and I would love to talk about preservatives and also product testing So the first thing I want to talk about is Everything that I do is soap almost everything so But I'm going to tell you that everything I developed in this is based on cosmetics So the question is for you is soap a cosmetic and the answer is Sometimes so if you want your soap to be soap You have to have a consist of an alkali of salt of fatty acids, and that's no problem So as you mix lye and oils you you meet that definition so everybody meets that definition usually and The product must be labeled sold and represented solely as soap so that means if you sell something that cleans You are selling soap and the cosmetics don't apply to you However, sometimes your soap is a cosmetic so I do not sell soap I Sell a product that will make your skin feel good after you use it. It makes your skin feel soft. It feels moisturizing I Make the process of making soap the interaction between the lies and the oils creates glycerin Glycerin is a humectant it attracts moisture out of the air to your skin and doesn't that sound moisturizing Soon as I say any of those things. I'm a cosmetic So because of that everything I've developed in this presentation or in my own practices is based on I am a cosmetic I'm not a drug If I sell a soap and I tell you that this soap is really good for acne Hmm I am crossing a line So even if I formulate it maybe it's a high coconut oil soap So it's high in cleansing if I promise that it's going to do something I fall under the food and drug administration And have to have my product tested and whatever it takes to be approved There are other examples are antibacterial cleansers Then they used to talk about the one but you know a lot of people a lot of the our soaps are good for people with Psoriasis and other skin conditions, but as soon as you start talking about that you're a drug So everything I talk about today I'm going to talk about is going to be based on what the federal drug and Cosmetic act talks about so there's two things that they really talk about is you must sell a product that's not adulterated or misbranded and That's what I'm going to talk about because what I did then is developed my good menu a good manufacturing practices So that I can meet these two answers or Things you have to meet All right, so here's the first goal. I'm going to create manufacturing and testing protocols I'm going to establish GMP to reduce the risk and the documentation that you can use for this also is ones from the federal government That basically exactly tells you what's in their regulation and then Marie Gale also puts out a book that is specifically directed towards GMP for soap makers and cosmetic makers So it's very good for us Just to give you an idea these are all the sections GMP is big and it gets real detailed and my goal was not to add all of this administrative work to make my job harder My goal was to make my product better and so that everything I do I did To create accountability for me so that my customers could could have that sense of That they knew what they were going to get every time so I don't look at it as a A bad thing even though it's a lot of regulation or a lot of documentation Because it's going to mean a better product and accountability for me Just you know GMP is not regulations it is practices it is not enforceable there is no audit from anybody The cosmetics I believe the government wants you to register it is optional And so I haven't done it and probably won't because I'm not sure what benefit that would give me but It is just a practice It is big you can tell from that previous slide So what you want to do is start with the biggest or the easiest areas that have the most risk to make mistakes All right, so now we're going to start talking about The different parts of GMP so the easiest place most Times to start is with your master formula So this is basically your recipe with enough detail that you will fight when you follow it You will get the same results every time and without it you can't guarantee that to your customers with it You already know of the base that you can create a consistent product A couple of things that contains the ingredients in the quantity detailed steps But not just do this do this do this but it also includes you know What temperature should the ingredients be at that step or how do you know when mixing is complete? What trace looks like or a thin trace or a thick trace? Also details for quality control. What does it look like? What does it smell like? How thick should it be when it comes to cream soap? Those types of things You know you have the right amount of detail when a Person that's reasonably familiar with similar projects products can follow your master formula So and that was the hardest thing Because the examples they go way way way deep so remember my goal was not to create this Administrative nightmare so that was one of the hard things was to find a level of detail that was correct The second thing is the batch record so it is Documenting that you are following your master formulation the easiest thing you can do is kind of start with your master Recipe and then create checkbox. That's the easiest way to move from that to that Includes the date made who made it how many units and also a batch record or batch log number All right, so that's the recipe now This came second for me, but really in the process it happens before you make your recipe is your ingredients spec So if your ingredients are not consistent from batch to batch You can't even if you follow the same recipe you may get different results So this part is establishing standard criterias for your ingredients and for your materials Then you're also going to look at your suppliers and who will supply them to meet your specifications and Then as you go through your master record then you'll verify the ingredients before using them One thing I learned is that you want to have two vendors for each of your ingredients or materials because what if they run out and you need to get some made or What if they quit selling your product and I you know you've all had that where they're back ordered and you're struggling to all of a sudden find it The one thing I ran into was I used a lot of Malibu bottles for my lotion and I have yet to find a substitute Supplier that I probably should have never started I should have picked something out and I'm using another bottle I don't like it as well That's the way this all right So so far this is everything we've talked about You need a master formula batch record a bachelor material specs inventory log and inventory batch record so that seems like a lot of information So let's take a second look at it So this is then how it starts right so before I can order ingredients I have to set my specs This is my example of what I use for my two material specs I probably have a sheet of paper that has four of these on a page so that I can cut them up and I will have them Posted on my racks so that when I look at them I have in front of me my shelf life When I and it also tells me who I will order them from it also has the scientific name And we'll talk a little bit about that in the end why it's important Here cocoa butter raw When you go to order if you don't have this now, what did I use in that last recipe was it raw or refined? Hmm because there's a difference in color and there's a difference in order and there's a difference in texture So when you go to order it, that's when these things become important When that ingredient then gets shipped to you you come in and you have your incoming raw material log So there you're going to write your lot number and what I do for lot number is I use a System where the first two numbers are the year that I received it in so I'll have 15 dash And then I'll have zero zero one, and I'll go through and that's my lot number When I received it the name the quantity and those things expiration date Which is really cool because I have it on the specs so I know where that to find that information and then a little bit of the other Information there is a final column that says accept doesn't meet the specifications And that's real easy again you have them right there in front of you you know how it should look and you should know how it should smell An example of one that you don't think of maybe is like Tubes where the lids don't fit on type like lip balm tubes or I had a batch of Bottles where the little plastic had a little catch on all of them I mean those are the kinds of things that you start to notice when you are actually inspecting things as they come in When after I Write on my log then I also Create a label for the product that I have fixed to it And that just is real simple it has product name lot number and expiration date and that way when I pick something up Because one of it was to verify it when you use it in your in your rest in your recipe right and so there is a quick way to verify the expiration date Just so you know well when I started this one of the things I did do was an inventory of my Ingredients and anything that I couldn't go back that year to find the the invoice for and I knew some of it was older than a year Those special ingredients you got to try once And I threw out because I couldn't Validate that and so I said gonna do it right gonna have that consistent product so there was ingredients I threw out at the beginning of the process Here's an example of my master batch recipe so it's kind of like the bottom part of my cream soap recipe and then it has the directions and I Include the ingredient how much of it and Also, then I include the NC name because I want those so Accessible when it comes to writing labels that I just make it part of everything and Then those are the directions. So yeah, so now you can see You know I weigh the coconut oil and add it to the slow cooker. I weigh the sunflower oil and add it to the slow cooker They're pretty detailed Possibly you could say add your soft oils add your hard oils. You know you would have to really think about that However like number 13 just to point out it's like pour the lies into the water Under the stove vent on high, so I think that's good because You do and I also talk about stir it isn't you know it stir until it's dissolved and water is clear So that's an example of not only you know mix the two, but what it should look like afterwards To me This is the best part that I've really loved is the batch log It has product number and I'll talk about how I come up with my product number in the next slide product name date Here's my batch number So the first thing that this does is when you start the next batch You go to the batch log to find out what batch number you're starting with next so that's a big thing I use my batch log when I say okay, which soaps are done curing I go to my batch log I say okay these and I'm ready to be done curing I didn't talk about that But you would also have a master recipe for how to package your soaps So it isn't just for the manufacturing side But it's also for the packaging side and how you get them out the door You think the cream soaps are probably harder because how am I going to get them in my jars so they might feel like a little bit more Then it talks about how many units so if I make a Log of soap at 16 bars at four and a half ounces each and so that's well fill in So product number you have to come up with your own way This is what I do. I have the first two letters talk about what kind of product it is So my CS is cream soap my LS is liquid soap my BS is bath soap or bar soap Then my middle one The next segment will talk about what recipe it is so under LS dash form one that is my form My first recipe if I have more liquid soaps I'll add form two The bath soap you can see there I have a swirl recipe that's a little bit slower moving for me facial soap will have More gentle ingredients and so it's formulated different so I will That tells me what recipe I'm using and then the last segment will tell me fragrance There Because I also and I'm trying to do this better I don't buy a lot of different colors when I make soap I try and buy my primary colors and mix them Well if I want to get the same purple now, I'm gonna have to start documenting So that'll come into play even when I do that or how much fragrance this kind of soap gets over this kind of soap That all comes into play and that's why it's important to have them for that So on that batch log then that's it my product ID will have my BS dash SW dash whatever All right, so now I'm ready to make soap finally and so now I'm going to follow my batch record So it's similar to the master record except you can check things off except there's a few other things to point out at the top You have your product ID so I have that you also have your batch number So those are the two things that this will identify this batch of soap and then you also have your date And I put a start time and an end time because I want to know how much my soap is costing me to make so that helps me with my labor When I do my costing I will start an end time for manufacturing certain end time for packaging and So I get a true cost of my labor And then I'll have the grams Listed and then I will also document the actual amount used and again This is because what is my standard operating procedure going to say if I get a little bit too much is that okay? Is 5% over okay as 1% over okay or 1% under okay? I mean what what is my variance level that I'm okay with? Because I don't always pour straight and then as soon as I do that then I create a little tag That has the product name the batch number the manufacturing date and that goes with first with the log And then after I cut it it goes with that and that's how it's identified on the shelves I Didn't say that when I create that tag for the ingredients a lot of times you have to put packaging tape over it because I'm telling you there is not a whole lot of inks that can hold up to oils and So that helps All right, then standard operating procedures So these are the ones with the most words I think and the harder Because you just do it or you don't do it you should be doing it So the good thing about standard operating procedures is it makes you question Your your how you do things so I have a scale is it accurate? How are you going to know how often should you test it to make sure it's accurate? Is there a right answer the right answer is whatever you put in your standard operating procedures and there probably is a little bit for some of them a A little bit better the calibrate your pH I think meter is supposed to be every month But there are other things Safety precautions look at I'm wild hair Do I need to wear a hairnet? You know all of those things I have a workshop my husband walks by my workshop and wants to come in Do I let him in after he's been out in the goat barn? You know it's some of that stuff which He doesn't like it when I think like that and I can't come out The other thing we didn't talk about is 10 minutes okay Is how I how do you handle complaints, so there's another? Possibly log that you can create but Afterwards it's really hard because it's the emotional thing do it ahead of time. It's not so bad All right, and these are examples just of other things That you can talk about I guess I did show you on that other screen there was a link Marie Gale also has a Good book on standard operating procedures So there it is so oh we're going to talk about labeling Yeah, so that was the other part for cosmetics you have to have unadulterated product and you have to have good labeling So we're going to talk about that next and They have different rules for your front panel which is what the Customers are most likely to read and the other panels which are called information panels and on the front panel You have to have your name your identity and your your contents your contents must be in both metric and in US measurements You have to identify is it so perso whatever else is it? And also then this is the part that I put up with from the government then is Then that your text they get very specific and needs to be an eighth of an inch high based on the letter lowercase o Placed bottom parallel in the bottom 30% of your label These things They will say good practice is even if you're selling soap to have this much okay? Again those soap is not regulated The information panels the back or side panels and that's what they say if you're selling soap you at least want to have your name and address Oh Okay uh Directions for safe use and you have to have your ingredients and warning statements So let's take a look at a couple of those your name and address I live on the farm Do I really want my farm address on my label? The answer is no, but you will the Now the the caveat is is if you're listed in a printed phone book you don't have to So I may look at that I do have people that drive up in my yard and Oh, we just stopped to see your your Thing and that's okay, but I would prefer a phone call Can I use a post office box and the answer is no? right now the H H H SCG handcrafted Soap cosmetic guild is putting together a petition to take to allow PO boxes But right now you cannot use them has to be your physical location Ingredients you need to use the NC name Which is from the cosmetic ingredient dictionary? Except your botanical ingredients you use their common name so You list them in order the ingredient that there's the most stuff is first and then you go down if you buy any type of a Base or a blend you have to list those ingredients Individually, too with respect to your soap so you can't just add I don't buy any base blends or bases, so I'm not sure what you have but you have to split them out well I I used to do a lotion base that I would buy so I can't just say lotion base I would have to list it any ingredients I have a really good recipe now Ingredients a couple more things Fragrance you can list as a catch-all you don't have to break it free so a lot of us like to say that we're phthalate free or paraben free or all those things They don't have to list it other products don't have to list it because of this and you can just list fragrance Ingredients that are less than one percent you don't have to worry about the amount There any order is fine Color additives there is a list of approved color additives And you have to abide by that but you can list them all last No matter if they're above that one percent or above that other So those are always last After all the other ingredients So some of you use essential oils So do and you'd like to probably say hey I use lemongrass essential oil What if you use lemongrass and tea tree? So if you want to list that you are using a lemongrass essential oil and you also have something else you have to list all of them You can't you know if it's a proprietary blend and you want only want to list a couple of them Nope you have to list all of the essential oils if you don't want to do that Then you have to list it as fragrance and then you don't have to give out your proprietary blend There are some special rules about Trade secrets and those I don't know nor did I include them so So that kind of the end of my presentation was there any questions for me? So the question was is how many goats do you need to before to make your to make it worthwhile? So what for a bar of soap? I say that one-fourth of your bar is goat's milk So if I make a four ounce bar, I need one ounce of goat's milk So in a gallon of goat Milk I get a hundred and twenty eight ounces so that can make me a hundred and twenty eight bars from that one gallon of goat's milk So if you're making milking a goat and they're giving you a gallon of milk a day You're making a lot of soap every day So one goat for you to start we'll do it and I only have a handful of goats that I milk I don't the rest are meat cross Or meat commercial meats You
