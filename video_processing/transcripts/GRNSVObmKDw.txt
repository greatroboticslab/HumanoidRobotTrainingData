Howto & Style
 What's up modern stedders? We're here at the Mother Earth News Fair and we're looking at some nice gardening tools that this gentleman makes in his backyard. Let's find out how he does it. So what's your process of making your, of all these nice fine tools? Well, obviously it varies a little bit from tool to tool, but first step is the forging. We start forging all the shanks first. The blades, I cut these blades out in a plasma machine. We buy this in 4x8 sheets. And depending, like I say, depending on the tool and quite what we're doing, we'll do all the forging, get ready to weld, and then there's a cleanup step to get this down to pristine metal for the weld. Weld them on there and then the trowels, for example, they go back, they go for another round of forging where I cup them and put the bend in them. After that, they sit and cool off a little bit to where we can mess with them again. And then they go back into the forge a third time for a heat treat cycle. That's the, you can see the heat treat line here where we've got a hard edge out here that fades back to softer, more ductile material in the center. Yep. We'll be fine. Yeah, a little bit of rust on this isn't going to hurt it. Within the first couple hours of using it again, it'll be shined up and look like a new one again. These tools are awesome, guys. I'm going to leave a link down in the description below. Hope you guys enjoyed that video. Don't forget to go check out Will over at the Homestead Iron.
