 If you want control over your tomato plants, start with controlling the water. Irrigation is your main steering control. Feed too often, and you waterlog your roots. Too little, and they dry out. Underwatering a plant is better due to recovery time. If you overwater, it can take days or even over a week to get back on schedule. Start small with your seedlings, clones and adjust frequency and water amount based on media, phase, and plant size. It's not one size fits all.
