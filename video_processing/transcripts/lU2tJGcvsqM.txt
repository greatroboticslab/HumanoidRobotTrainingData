 Chris and I had the opportunity to finally get down to the National Farm Machinery Show. It was our first time ever actually going. I've wanted to go for years, but running my business and being such a small business, it's hard for me to get away for that many days and not be able to do all the other stuff I have to do. But this year I bit the bullet and went down there, and it was a lot of fun. We got to see all sorts of stuff. Spent a couple days there, or parts of a couple of days, talking to a lot of folks. The second day we saw things that we missed the first day. Either you walk right by it, or there's so many aisles that, well, you just get confused on what you saw and what you didn't. And they have stuff for tractors big and small. I mean, a lot of the equipment that was there is not really relevant to my business and to what I sell or what I use either. But it's still cool to see some of that really big equipment in person that's in pristine condition, right? Brand new showroom quality. But of course there were plenty of different tools and tractors and all sorts of brands. You could sit out and try them out and see how they felt. So a really good opportunity. If you ever get the chance to go, I'd highly encourage you to do so. They say if there's one show you're going to go to, this is the one. We bumped into a whole pile of YouTubers out there too, so you'll probably see some familiar faces in the video. But I thought we'd just kind of take you through, mosey on through all the booths that we saw. Just kind of like you're there yourself. So let us know what you think. Here we go. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Are you exercising? Stop driving, man. Thank you. Oh, you're fine. Hey, we got the big map now. Okay, so we're... Let's get out of the way here. This is like their 1025R model right here. Yeah. It's 20S. See, it's got one of those flip-around seats on there. There's no third function. Oh, geez. 104,000. 45, 40. Yeah, they're good-looking tractors. They're good-looking tractors. They're good-looking. It's been disgusting, you know. Forever. It's been disgusting, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of hydraulics there. Oh, cool. Oh, spoilers. 24-mile house. That's cool, Baylor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I got to check that out. It says Tree Terminator. That could be cool. No, I'm just kind of looking around. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are these guys, uh, the three-foot one? Yeah. Oh, this is a three-point mount. Yeah. It's like a little mini one. I wonder if this fits on, uh, if a subcompact would lift it. Ooh. Ooh. Yeah. 10 percent. That's because you have 10 percent pricing. Yeah. 10 percent. 20 inch. Yeah. Yeah. Nasty. Yeah. 80. 333D minimum. I'm afraid that. The hydraulic flow is almost the same. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's almost the same on the JCB. All I need is 10 gallons a minute. Oh, okay. At 2000 PSI. Wow. So any 50 horse power skid loaders got that. Oh, yeah. For sure. Not much at all, even for the bigger one, the 20-inch? Well, 20 inch, I need 15 gallons a minute. Okay. But still any skid loader today is producing that. Yeah. Wow. You just have to have the 20 inch, I'm looking at lift capacity. Okay. Wait, lift capacity? This weighs 1,400 pounds. Oh, oh, okay. and the 20 inch weighs 2200 pounds. Okay. So you have to have the carrying capacity. Yeah. But this one here. Is this a 14 inch? This is a 14. Wow. That's sweet. It only weighs 800 pounds, but there's a lot of head average on out there. So. Is this a telescope or no? It doesn't telescope. It just rotates. Okay. Swivel. Oh, nice. That's cool. That's handy. So that's good for limbs and stuff then too. Yep. On a skid loader, you got eight foot of reach here. So you ought to be able to reach up about 16 foot inside. Okay. Up to 10 inches in diameter. That's sharp. What's the tree terminator? Is that the mower? Well, tree terminators are named brand. Oh, it is. Oh, okay. So all of these are tree terminator. Okay. They're made by Grace Manufacturing. That just happens to be our rotary mower. Okay. What size does that got? Five inches in diameter. Okay. All right. And what kind of float do they use? Standard float. Up to 25 gallons. 15 to 25. Okay. So we have a little version of it that will go up to 45 gallons. And what diameter will that cut? Eight inch. Oh. That's nice. Huh. Okay. That's cool. How do you guys sell? Mostly through distributors. Okay. Depend on where you're located. If we have a distributor in your area or not. If we don't, we just sell direct. Okay. Where are you located at? I am a dealer in Michigan. So. Up in Michigan. Yeah. But I sell. Farmco is our distributor. Oh, are they? Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I sell online though. I sell nationwide. So. Well, you can buy from Farmco. Good. Okay. Well, that's good to know. It's our distributor up there. Okay. Huh. I'll have to check that out. That might be worth looking into. This is the Voltra I have right here. Got that same one. OK. All right. 30. I don't even have a rep here. That looks. That looks sweet. Those triple stack of weights. No, double stack of weights. Got a little bit of a counterweight up here. Pretty sick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. oh wait yeah they do okay that way all the stuff's way back there but you're still total control up here huh but it's all electric then wow interesting is it the same series then yeah it's the same sprayer it's just kind of here much okay so in other words if you want to do all three at the same time you flip that on okay yeah and you need it to increase your pressure a little bit six eight ten twelve twenty four maybe twenty five twenty six i don't even know what they'll say oh man it seems like so much maintenance oh oh I think this would be like what the summit size is like. I think so. This must be like a fairly economy model. 7320 power shuttle. This is kind of like the M4. It's pretty similar overall. This must be the... Is it not? Baller cab, isn't it? Is this not the... Huh? Reason other than just looking? No, I'm just looking around. I'm looking for new manufacturers to work with too. Fill out my lineup if I need to. What do you mean? Depends. Depends whatever. I just want quality, good pricing, features, accessibility. You know? So... I know your business model. I kind of observed your business model. Yeah. You would like the gentleman over there on the phone. Yeah. These are very tech. He kind of gets out about that. Yeah. Are you doing anything with summit? Or are you just influencing? Summit tractors. Are you developing new products or just trying to perfect the one you have? I agree. So... Are you... Now your equipment like... I'm taller than it. I just feel like all the moving parts on those things. Oh, okay. There's a PTO. Guess what? Yeah. See, you're on the pump. And that's probably... Yeah, I mean, that's a good thing. Yeah, I mean, like this... Take some random pictures. Yeah. Are you... Are you guys still doing just the one pin and then the bolt-on second pin? Yes. Okay. It's a big cost consideration. Could be... It's a lot. And then it doesn't... Well, most of them have... Did the coupler have two holes? Yeah. I mean, so they'd be able to... Because if you had... If you needed this... You know, I'm selling... When I'm selling these, they're like a 5 series, right? Like a... Yeah. 520M or something like that, right? Cool. Yeah, and that's pretty much you can do that. Yeah. So you can retrofit though your old... Yes. Oh, sweet. You have that cross here, you can do that. That's... That's huge. One of the newest things. That's a big deal. The location was great, I thought. It is a good location, yeah. It was really easy to get in there. You definitely weren't gonna get anybody that came by. But yeah, it works out. Do you guys have any of the... Like your three point stuff... Like your... I didn't read that close. I just saw like they all posted it on their... What's that? But he's there. Over seven foot tall, isn't it? Yeah, I don't know. I didn't have any of the managers. Should've just kept the manager, you know? Huh. Kind of missed it though. Actually, I can't even get a video title anymore. But, uh... Backo? Doesn't... It's actually... I feel like this tubing here is a lot smaller. North Carolina, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty sure. It's a lot smaller. It's a lot smaller. Yeah, that's a lot smaller. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot smaller. Yeah, yeah. I think so. I think so. I think so. I think so. I think so. I think so. I think so. I think so. I think so. North Carolina. Well, that's where their headquarters. Doesn't say that's where it's made. Hey, how much? How are you? Good. I was looking around today. Is that a flail mower there too? Or is that a tiller? That's a tiller. That's a tiller? Yeah. Okay. So flail mower flail. You're like the only ones on the market that make a quick hitch compatible flail mower. Oh, sweet. Been since 1980. No kidding. Yeah. Wow. So yeah, we manufacture North Carolina, but we've got dealers off the line. Interesting. Oh, they have cedars too. Wow. This would be great though if we're around the ponds, you know. Yeah. Oh yeah. Right. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This would be great though if we're around the ponds, you know. It would be fun to have a blower mounted on the skid steer, you know? That would be sweet. I bet that thing would chuck it, you know? Well, actually, the designer was fired. He was let go. He was still a lot of. Not contacted here, but he was trying to contact the other guy. I mean, these grill guards, I've seen a few of these now that have like nothing on there. You know? I don't quite understand that. There are no armrests. Lovely. There's the only thing on this whole fender here is the joystick. Got your controls up here though. This is nice. Wow. This is quite basic. Huh. Those are fat tires, aren't they? That brush marks. Stanford's car's head Imagine half how should I be talking about finding a camera. Wow. A brush mark. Please do not sit or stand on moor. 56 grand. Oh, 40 grand. Oh, but you get a... Where's that... Yeah, that's sharp. Can you see it digs the initial, softs it up, this flings it out, and then it smooths the bottom of the trench right there. I think I've seen these online before. Halsey was I like the Kubota batteries probably. Nice. Yep. Like, it looks fake. I will say, look how short these ROPs are. These are great. Hey, I found them. That do what exactly? Is this a drain a lake? Is that what it is? How's it going? Good, how are you? Good. Good. Got some cool stuff here, man. Looks like it's built like a brick house. Wow. Huh. Yep. Did you get something at the show? I'm sprinkling skid steer stuff now and then. Where are you from? From Michigan. Oh, sure. To this show? Mm-hmm. That's big. I know, yeah. It's about as big as it comes. Yeah, that's what I hear. If you're going to go to one, this seems to be the one to go to. They do a lot of skid steer stuff, but I do. I just. Oh, yeah. We're by 30 miles from the skid throw and quick attach. Oh, okay. Those. Well, we're getting a lot of, I guess, traction in the motor show. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Huh. Kind of shows it all. And, then also, you and our one bigger team, but they're tanking today. Basically make sure they would both work in there and so we wanted to just put one in. Gotcha. Got a safety bar. Brace the neck, break the shoulders. Yep. And the way this is set up, this is ground level. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Probably be all right. Yeah. He keeps doing it, you know. He's a trooper. Safety is convenient. One pin, one bolt. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah. Yep. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Nope. Perfect. I can say these are a lifesaver. Huh? A lot of our personal. Thank you. Yeah. I'm going to just decide. I'm going to. I can't. All right. So let's see. We got to go. Wow. That's a whole other. Whole other world in here, isn't it? Right. Let's see. I've heard about you. I've talked to. Hang. I've talked to other people. Talk to you. I don't know how we ever talk. I know. That's just how it goes, you know. Today, huh? Yeah, we got a meet and greet. Do. We got a meet and greet. Do. Yeah. The bunch of people stop by. I'm doing well. How are you? Nice to meet you in person. You know Tony? Yeah. We just bumped into each other. Yeah. So I was looking around the rest of the area for you, but you're blending in. Everybody's here. They're doing good. That's awesome. Arms family. I watch you all the time. Likewise. I still don't know how you do it. Do a video every day, man. Can I tell you what? Facebook has been really good for me. Some people are doing it. I know. I know. Do you? I don't. We put them on the phone. I don't. We put them on the phone. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. We put them. We just download them the same video we put on YouTube, you know. Is it any good? Not really. This thing? Oh, this is kind of hydraulic. Kind of fingers on it. What do you mean? I'm in a car right here. Okay. Wow. This is $100,000 and then this is what he won. Wow. Actually when you hit it, you kind of get that, that, that harmonic noise. Oh yeah, yeah. I heard it. Yeah. Touches. That's crazy, man. No. Good to see you. Yeah, you too. You too. Yeah. How's it going? Nice to see you. How's the show? Fun. Yeah, we were here yesterday too and you can't see it all, well you think you see it all one day and you don't. You miss all sorts of stuff, you know. But then you get pulled in different directions and all that kind of thing too. So yeah. It's a big crowd out this morning. We were just talking about it. I think it's bigger today than it was yesterday. That rain's helping right now. Yeah. Yeah, it is. It is. But the line even to get in was long. Just, you know, through parking and all that. But, so, that's a good thing. Oh yeah. You got anything that, for like compact tractors that maybe I should take a look at? Um, are you selling our root rake grapples, like our baby root rakes? The light duty root rakes? Yeah. So, I just looked at those the other day. Is the more work saver maybe on those or? Well, so the big, the huge concern with small tractors is lift capacity, right? And so like the work saver grapples with little guys are. Yeah, that's the root rake. I really prefer that. I think that does a better job. Yeah. This thing, you put a six inch branch in there, it'll just rattle ahead this bottom to pick something up. Oh, yeah. That's what calls you times. A few times. I do it right, kind of clean up. With this, you end up standing it on end, you're hard on your dump cylinder. Yes. Weren't they? Yeah, yeah, they are a little bit more money. And, so no 72 then for like a four series? No, I would. People would love to have a two inch receiver in those forks. They would, they would. Well, you know, I mean, Wild just orders a whole pile and I have them bring a few skids, you know, what do they come in six packs or 12 packs? I can't remember, but. Right off the top of my head, I don't remember what our up chairs are. Okay. And then the pulverizing basket at the end, that's going to break down the rest of your clumps and kind of give you a smoother finish. Okay. All right. I think quite a bit lower than one of these guys. Oh, for sure. So, shoes on. Yeah. Yeah. Big old. Well, but still, even the business end down here. You know all that? Hey, how are you doing Bill? It's just a really, sell this to make any money. And if you ever want to sell the company, I'd be interested. Yeah. If you had a patent on it. Oh, no kidding. Yeah. I like it. Yeah, and 30 days later, it was, a little back. Walk it out here. You know? You should visit Facebook, Democratic I believe but not all your friends do and that's why you deliver if you want this. Because it's a bigger, beefier one. There's a lot of people here. I was coming by to see everybody. It's like the highest concentration of YouTubers in the area. I gotta get pictures. I'm taking pictures. I can't post them because I ain't got no signal. Look at that. I thought she was a millennial horn. Yeah, right. You too, want to take a dump on one? They just come from your damn state. I got a YouTube channel. I mean, mainly the small compact tractor type stuff though. Clips it, cleans it. I don't know. I just had a new radius lower. No. I had a disc. It's healthy. Like green. Yeah. I like green. I like grains Oh, these are on a disco, too. I know. But maybe the language is not official. Huh? Jake. What am I missing here? Thanks, buddy. So there's some sights and sounds for you. Just kind of, well, let's just say it was a lot busier the second day than it was the first. I don't know what the last couple days are like, but we went the first two days and they got really packed out. But man, it was a good time. I think we'll probably make it down there again. I just kind of moseyed around and Chris followed along with the camera. I think next time we do it, though, we'll probably both be mic'd up. A lot of good, well, you're just noticing things, right? So a lot of new equipment that you're seeing. You're trying to figure out what some of it is or maybe what differentiates it. And so there was a lot of good back and forth banter. We talked to quite a few reps, too. That was pretty fun. Now, of course, we do sell tractor attachments. That's one of the main reasons we were there to kind of seek some new manufacturers out.
