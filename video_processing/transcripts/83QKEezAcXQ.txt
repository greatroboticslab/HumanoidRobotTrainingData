Tech alone ‘won’t raise farm yields’

 Hi, my name is Onyeka Akuma and I'm the founder and CEO of Farm Crowdie, a digital agriculture platform that connects small scale farmers with investors for the purpose of boosting food production in the country. Farm Crowdie started pretty much about 21 months ago and today we've been able to work with about 7,000 small scale farmers across 10 states in Nigeria. So what we've done is we've pretty much simplified how people now get involved in farming practices. So now you can go on our mobile device, on our mobile app or you go on our website and decide that you want to be a maize, rice or soya or cassava farmer and then at that point you make a decision and then invest your money through the platform. When you do so, we then engage a farmer on your behalf that becomes a partner with you who then goes to work on the farm and then he's providing you with updates in front of pictures, videos and text until the farming cycle is done. In addition to that you can also visit your farmer that you've partnered with to find out about the progress of the farm right here on the farm. So that level of involvement where you're now partnering with real farmers that are working on farms elsewhere gives people the opportunity to now be anywhere, now use their mobile devices and now I too have now become a farmer because I got involved with Farm Crowdie. And then at the end of the harvest season you then get your money back and then return after harvest. So you just be able to go through the full cycle through your mobile device or the website. Farm Crowdie itself is designed for the guys that want to invest but don't want to go to the farm. And so you're now able to bring in very true platform for us to do work with the farmers. On the farmer side however, the advantage we're able to bring to them is that we get them the imputes they need at no cost. So they get imputes, seed, fertilizer, label. They get technical know-how to work on the farms and they get market access for them to sell their farm produce. In all of these points, when it comes to imputes, there's not much around technology that we do in our regards. When it comes to the technical know-how, in order to extend the hands of our extension workers, what we do is we provide the farmers with the ability, we're building solutions around, providing farmers with the ability for them to start interacting with tech-calfing specialists without them physically being there. Using ussd codes, touch points like that to reach out to them to get them to provide whatever questions they have. And these tech-calfing specialists are able to respond to that. On the market side, we then provide the farmers with the best market available. As a result of the efforts from our end, we're able to source for people that are looking at buying the commodity or buying the harvest. We're now introducing African farmers to the technologies we tell them will help them improve their farm operations or increase the yield by providing demonstration farms where we're able to now find ambassador farmers. So in the community of 100 farmers, each having a hectare. If we get two or three that we can work with in the first year, we can show that, see how we're able to improve this yield, see how we're able to get market access, see how we're able to deploy the imputes with him and see how much the farmer has made. That in itself helps to sell. And irrespective of how ignorant the farmer is, he sees farmer A doing well. It's enough knowledge for him to know that he needs to jump on.
