 Do you see our screen presentation effectively? Yes, we see it. Okay, very good. So, yes, I'm Jason and I have been working in Vietnam since 2006 in collaboration with friends at Canto University. I have worked there on a range of different basically soil related projects, but firstly with ACR there on a rice shrimp project looking at sustainability of the rice shrimp system. And then that led on to what we call the focus project, which is farmer options for crops under saline conditions. And with me, I have Brooke who is postdoc on that project. Hi, everyone. I also have worked in Vietnam for a while, but started in 2015 as part of my undergraduate project. And I have progressed through after getting my PhD and now work full time on this focus project and interested in soil plant sort of microbial interactions. So it's a great, great space to explore this. Right, yeah. So yeah, the project is funded by ACR and it's led in Australia by us at Charles State University. And our in country lead is Canto University. So just as a brief intro, of course, the delta in Vietnam is hugely important to the country. It's about 12% of the area. It's about 12% of the area. Very flat area. And so it is all pretty much less than four metres above sea level, except for a few hills or what the locals call mountains. But yeah, so a lot of it's a lot of it's even less than two metres above sea level. Agriculture is hugely important to the economy in the delta, with 80% of the jobs associated with agriculture in some way. And the delta produces over 50% of the country's rice production, and a lot of that is exported as well. So the economic value is quite large. So the food bowl of Vietnam is the delta. However, over the recent years, there's been competition for the water that's coming down through the Mekong River. So with upstream water use and damming, we've had due to climate change, drought is a lot more regular now. And even the rainfall patterns have been disrupted. So 10 years ago, the dry and wet season were very set, whereas now they're quite variable and unpredictable, which causes problems, of course, to the farming, the cropping systems. Seed level rise is an issue being close to the equator. And so the seawater rise has been recorded as being about 12 to 14 millimetres per year. And of course, as the seawater rises, the saltwater starts coming up through the canal and river system. And so in this diagram in the map here, you can see that there's lines that show the extent of salinity coming through into the delta inland, up upstream, up canals and salinizing the land. And so you can kind of see there in 2010, you know, and it's around the coastal areas or pericoastal areas. 2016 was a rather large drought effect and salinity really started to impact rice crops and farmers were in a lot of trouble because they never experienced this before in some areas because it had moved so far inland. And you can see there in 2020 it happened again and even further in some areas. And so you literally have a situation where people who have been able to farm a certain way for decades, all of a sudden were starting to be impacted by this seawater rise and the saltwater intrusion coming up the canal system. And of course, their response once that happened was, OK, I can't irrigate from the river anymore because it's saline, so I'll groundwater pump instead. And of course, removing water from a delta system makes the land subsidence worse. And so whilst the seawater rise is that 12 to 14 millimetres per year, land subsidence is around 40 millimetres per year. And so the net effect of that, of course, is around 50 millimetres a year in a system where you are two metres above sea level. So that's like, that's pretty, that's a bad situation. And that's the situation that we're working in. And of course, the problem is that that salinity and the effect of the drought basically have hundreds of thousands of hectares impacted by salt and by lack of water. And you have all that loss of production, loss of farm income and impact on communities, rural communities. So that's our problem. And of course, this, the worst of this situation, the worst of the saltwater intrusion and the drought occurs in the dry season. So in a lot of areas through the delta, they'll grow three crops of rice a year. And our problem is largely in this early dry season situation. And so it's this third rice crop that gets often will get killed by the salinity. But even in areas where they grow two rice crops, they stretch that out such that that second rice crop is still susceptible in some years to impacts by salt. So our, what we're looking at is alternatives to rice in this dry season period. And the farmers that we work with and the DAD, so the Department of Agricultural and Rural Development, government agencies that we work with, they all say you can teach us to grow new crops. We can use new soil techniques, but the crop has to be valuable. We have to, it has to have a stronger market value than rice because we can grow more rice and the farmers will still be poor. So the alternative has to be, has to be a marketable, profitable crop. And so we focus on that as well. So in looking at these alternative crops, we look at the crop, but also the soil management and the agricultural management of the field to be able to grow those crops. So we've kind of got the biophysical, the crop, the selection of the crop species and also variety, and then the soil management that supports that, that, that crop and that sort of thing. Brooke will go into more detail, but we're talking about raised beds to minimize the effects of, of water logging, mulches to minimize evaporation and decrease the effects of salinity, for example. And then of course there's nutrition on top of that. We are looking at the socioeconomic value chain sort of market analysis. So, you know, if we grow these crops, is there a market for them? What are those markets? What are the barriers to adoption of those crops within the supply chain? So we, we're examining those within the project. We need to have a really good understanding of how salinity of the soil and the waterways changes through time and space. And so if you look through the literature and online, you'll see maps of the delta that change that shows salinity, but often they're created by monitoring points in the waterways and not actually measuring salt in soil or salinity in soil. So we're looking at doing that by a range of different mechanisms. And so we have a team of people who actually measure salinity in soil and also the waterways, but we also are doing it with remote sensing as well, because we have a really strong GIS team that's capable of doing that sort of stuff for us. And so the value of doing that is we can understand what can we grow, where can we grow it and under what conditions. And then with that spatial temporal mapping, we actually can match up where you're going to get large enough scale of land to support those new crops to maybe then inform government to say, look, you can support private industry here or change policy to create incentives for businesses to come in and fill this. Nice part of the supply chain to enable uptake of this alternative crop and give it a value. And then the fourth part is we're looking at the role of gender in the whole process from knowledge creation in the research team through to the extension to growers, the uptake on farm and also within supply chains as well. Understanding that it's a really rapidly moving space and often that impacts genders differently. And so we need to just understand what we're dealing with there and how can we help offset some of the changes that are going to be occurring. Cool. So for the purpose of this presentation, we'll focus on the biophysical aspect of the project. And that comes down to looking at alternative crops to rice to suit this dry season period. So when we first started out, we had to make a criteria that we could identify crops that could be suitable. To start with, it was saline tolerant crops. So obviously towards the end of the dry season, the saline intrusion is really gets quite high and soil salinisation is the worst during that later reproductive phase. So salt tolerant crops that can grow and reproduce and then create a profitable yield was the criteria we looked at. Water use efficient crops or crops that used lower amounts of water to complete their life cycle was something that was really important. You can get crops that are salt tolerant, but use a lot of water and in a system where there's freshwater scarcity, it's just not suitable. There's a risk. There's a high risk of failure. We also needed crops that could fit the climate of the Mekong Delta in that dry season. The temperatures can get to 35 degrees. We get these variable, very low rainfall patterns. You're relying on irrigation. So these sort of crops that fit there, not a crop that's a cold tolerant sort of crop. They had to be able to work in with the available labour that exists in these small holder farms. There are some crops that can fit both the salt tolerant and water use efficient criteria, but require great amounts of manual labour. And that just doesn't work in the system. So finding something that we can adapt with the available mechanisation and tools available to farmers. And most of all, as Jason said, it had to be something that is profitable at the end of the day for the farmers, because they need a yield to sell at market. Otherwise there's no point in investing in this. So we sort of based our crop selection off these criteria, came up with a few different species to test and understanding that there will always be more species. We can't test them all, but we can look at the adoption protocols and practices of how that occurs. So we did a range of glass house and greenhouse trials, both in Australia and Vietnam. And these helped us sort of work out the salinity and drought or water use screening of different species, as well as once we identified species, the varieties available in Vietnam that could be best suited to those perhaps different spatial areas. There may be areas that are saline affected, but has lots of water. And there are varieties that suit that. Alternatively, there are areas of the Delta that have less saline intrusion, but water is an issue. So you sort of suit varieties to those areas. So we also did water use efficiency sort of screening. And through all of those, we did things like measuring plants or parameters, lots of different leaf indexes, prolines, yields, biomasses, roots, nodules, all those sorts of things. So from here, the range of trials that we did, it helped us establish what we could use in the field. And so some of the crops we've trialled, cowpea as a legume, beetroot, watermelon, maize, quinoa, we've done a range of different crops. And we utilise the information from the glass house and greenhouse trials to work out where they are best suited in the Delta. We have trials across, it's a transect across the Delta, starting in Sok Trang, which is quite close to the coast where saline intrusion is the worst, all the way up to Ang Yang, where it's a broader scale cropping systems. Freshwater scarcity is more of an issue rather than saline intrusion. So there's an adoption of different species there. We have these dry season trials, and then it goes back into rice cropping after we're finished. And we are looking at both the performance of our alternative species and then things like the impacts of that on rice afterwards, as well as different varieties where they suit, where they're best located. So with those field trials, we've got the species that we've selected, but we've also looked at different management practices that we can use to enhance and optimise the growth of these alternative crops. We use a soil monitoring moisture device called Chameleon soil moisture sensors. These are Australian made and I'll go into detail in the next slide. But we help farmers understand irrigation schedules. They're familiar with growing rice, which is obviously flood irrigation. These upland crops, different water requirements. We can make more efficient water decisions. And so we're using these tools to test those thresholds there. Rice straw mulching, different mulching trials. We're doing rate trials, combinations with things like compost and biochar. Chameleon, so monitoring irrigation with mulch. So it's just integrating these different management practices in things like raised beds, as you can see in one of the pictures up the top there. So chameleons are a pretty cool device. So this is a very cool device. They are developed originally by CSIRO in Australia, and now they're sold through the Virtual Irrigation Academy, which is a non-for-profit organisation. They measure soil moisture through soil tension. And the beauty about this is rather than interpreting something that could be complex to a farmer, as in a reading in kilopascals, it comes up with a traffic light system to indicate the level of soil moisture that's there. And this makes it really easy to use. It provides real time data back to the farmer. And it's relatively cheap compared to things like tensiometers. They are, however, limited by quite high levels of salinity. And we're working to see where those sort of thresholds exist and how they fit in with our system. So the traffic light system, just very quickly, blue is, it's been calibrated to mean you've got a soil tension between zero and minus 22 kilopascals. So your soil is essentially wet. You don't need to irrigate it. The green is moist. And once a farmer sees the red lights come up, they know they have to irrigate. You can have multiple different layers. So each light corresponds to its own sensor. And that sensor can be put at different depths. So you could have zero to five, five to ten, ten to fifteen centimeters. So if you can use the farm, or we use them spatially because we've got shallow rooted species, we might use them between treatments to determine what irrigation is happening there. So it's a really useful tool for farmer engagement and as an educational tool, but also a research tool for us. So there is a chameleon card version, which is a cheaper method of it, but it doesn't log data like the Wi-Fi one does. So you can see a farmer here in Vietnam. I think the video will play. The light's flashing. So he attaches the wire and then it will indicate, I think, a green light there. So hopefully he doesn't go and irrigate that crop. But yeah, super easy to use. So that's what we're sort of utilising in our field trials. And without that intervention, the farmer behaviour that's been observed is they irrigate every day because they think they have to. And they've got no other information to say that that's not a good idea. But we've used the chameleons to demonstrate that actually you don't need to irrigate every day. Yeah. So when this is just an example of sort of a field trial experiment we've got set up and we have what we would call the farmer practice, which is that irrigating every day or whatever they perceive as their ideal irrigation. And what we've found is it follows something along the lines of what they would do with rice. And then we compare that to our treatments of a chameleon with no straw and then various rates of straw mulch to see what water savings we can get. And it's been we've done this over a few years now and the results are really consistent and exciting. We have found and so we'll report beetroot or red beets, whatever you'd like to call it. This is just some from a recent trial that we did. And along the y-axis, you can see the water applied. So that's how much water over the growing season that this trial used. And we used farmers in this, so we're engaging the farmers in the field trials and getting sort of buy in there. We can see your first column is a chameleon with no mulch. And so that was, you know, you're irrigating based off what the chameleon says, but you don't have any mulch. The next one is the same. It's chameleon, but you've got seven tonnes of rice straw there. And that's then compared to a farmer's irrigation with 10 tonnes of mulch. So more mulch than the chameleon one. Yeah. So our seven tonne was something that we came up with with our experiments, sort of demonstrated seven tonnes was the optimal rate for rice straw mulch, whereas the farmers were doing 10 tonnes as their standard practice. So that's why that rate is different. Bit of a comparison. We're trying to also show there's efficiencies, hopefully through less labour and straw and use like that. And this was really cool because we had, here's our beetroot yield in tonnes per hectare. And you can see mulching makes a huge difference. So chameleon, no mulch, it's significantly less yield, but the chameleon with seven tonnes per hectare, and then the farmer irrigation with 10 tonnes, there was no yield difference. So the take home message is that you can use less water and less straw if you use a chameleon and you get the same yield. And we've had this, not just across with beetroot, we've had it with maize, watermelon. We're extending that now into cowpea and quinoa. So it's exciting to show the farmers these benefits. They don't have to water every day. You don't have to put on as much straw, but you still get the same yields that you would if you used that much water and that much mulch. So this is really, it's just a feel good moment when you see this data. So what we know from where we are at this point in the project is that we have found alternative crops work. And as I mentioned before, you know, people approach us all the time with different crops. You know, have you tried this? Have you tried that? We're not there to find the one crop that will save everything. It's the principle of how we implement and adopt new crops and the criteria that we need to focus on, and how we can work that into a system that's been predominantly rice based for many, many years. So we've grown these crops, novel crops in areas that have not seen alternative crops, and they work, which is good to know. And they're profitable. Profitable. Yeah, yeah. Be true. I don't have the quote here, but we interviewed this farmer in the picture, and he made, I think, 27 million dong per thousand metre squared compared to rice, which was two or three thousand. So significant increases in farm income, which is fantastic. And I think the next point, you get that water saving if you combine some management practices to help optimise those crops. There will be, there's many other things that you can do, but these are two achievable and accessible tools for farmers. They have rice straw. Chameleons are relatively cheap. We're looking at ways we can, you know, get more of these tools out to farmers or increase awareness of irrigation. The seven tonne mulch seems to be the magic number consistently throughout our trials, 10 tonnes. It either, you know, it doesn't improve yield or improve anything. So that's a good threshold to know, and we sort of work from that now. It's better than two and a half tonnes, but seven tonnes is no better than 10. So that's useful to know. And we have found that 25% saving in labour, and that would be through irrigation, like not having to irrigate daily. You can get that back to a household, and we have interviews where farmers have said that they now have more time to take their grandchildren to school and things like that. So there's social benefits as well, as well as 25% savings in fuel, and that's from running pumps and things like that. So there are all these sort of other benefits to the alternative crops and the management practices that we're looking at. However, there are still, of course, things that we still need to know and need to find these out. And these are research questions of interest. Timing being a big one. So the finding those sowing windows where we avoid abiotic stresses like temperature, the saline intrusion, those sort of water limitations, they are really important to fit in with a cropping calendar of rice that's already there. And that's a really big challenge because one of the effects of the climate change is the unpredictable weather. So in our journey working there in the last few years, we've had the early storm events that have flooded sites, and we've had the heat wave effects that kill seedlings, whereas the year before that didn't happen. And so when you talk to the farmers, has it been this hot before, and they've never seen it this hot before. So things are changing. And so that unpredictability is a real issue for us trying to fit these new crops into the system. Yeah. And then, as Jason said, it's fitting them into the system and then fitting them into their cultural practices. So Vietnam has a big holiday in our new year, but it's Tet. And when you speak to farmers or researchers, they say no one will grow crops over that period because they require irrigation daily and everyone takes two weeks off or 10 days. So it's working out, it's, you know, we might have the scientific answer, but it's how that fits into a socio sort of family household dynamic practice and the implications of changing something like that. So we have to sort of look into that as well. And then on top of that, it's then optimising once we've sort of got the timing right and it fits into a cycle that works for the farmers. So we're looking at the soil, and we're looking at soil constraints, those sorts of things. The soil is, has been growing rice for many years. There's probably micronutrient research, macronutrient. But it's a small gamut of optimisation that could go into that to further in a way that's low input and high productivity, high profitability for farmers. Those are the sort of questions that we're looking at in the future. And of course, those alternative crops, if they have benefit to the subsequent rice crop, that means that you can wind back the fertiliser inputs, then you change the risk profile because now you don't have so much capital invested in fertiliser, for example. And so if the crop fails, the losses aren't as great. So there's those sort of things to take account of as well. Yeah. So with that, that's a nice little wrap up of our project and our team and fantastic team members in Vietnam who really do a great job of pulling all these field trials and research questions together for us. So it's a great place to work and explore these big picture questions. Yeah. Thanks for the opportunity to present. Thank you very, very much for this wonderful presentation. I enjoyed it a lot and have a few questions myself, but I will give the floor first to others. Questions, please. Also comments are welcome. Suggestions and Stefan is first. Yeah, no, a great presentation and a lot of learning for us in the Asia and Meka Delta initiative. So linking up is really, really useful, valuable and hope we can do this further going forward together. That's just one comment, but my question is a little bit around the choices that you made that the initial crops that you tested. Did you do some sort of market analysis before? Because you sort of didn't talk about that. That's fine. But just to know, did you do a market? It does be through the market out there. There's a potential there or for the melon or whatever it may be. Quinoa, etc. Over. Yes. Yeah. So we did in as far as we knew that we couldn't do every single crop. And so we grouped them into sort of, you know, cereal types or grain crops, vegetables and did it that way. But what's what's what I've learned out of that process is that the scale of operation matters a lot. And so there are some small, small farms where perhaps some more labour intensive niche, like beetroot or something like that, which they can sell locally at a high price works for that small farm. Whereas if that was done on a bigger farm, the higher labour requirement, more labour units, all of a sudden that's not economical anymore. Whereas if you move somewhere to a larger scale, then mechanisation becomes super important. And something like quinoa is viable, whereas it's not viable on a small farm because, you know, it's you need to be mechanised to actually make that function. And so so whilst we're doing those, we are doing those supply chain studies, we we started with the agronomic to get the ball rolling in that. And now we can refine and probably chase the winners a little bit better, if that makes sense. Yeah. And I think matching up existing small markets, households, you know, the growth of vegetables sold on the side of the road. You understand there's a familiar that rarity there. And it's just as Jason said, matching that to where those smaller communities might exist or if it's broader scale and you can get harvesters in. Yeah. Thanks. I my question is actually very similar. So I use my current power to jump the line a bit. Sorry, Mike. How did you come up with the actual crops that you were testing or that you tested in the in the field? I mean, you showed the requirements and kind of the the general framework that they should should should meet. But there's probably still I mean, dozens of options available. Did you sit down and brainstorm or did you have like a process for that? Did you ask experts come to university? What was the. So we so we had we had the literature. We had, you know, what's possible from the literature. We worked very closely and and and it's my mistake. I have not got that on my my final slide there in terms of who's in the team, but the the DAD, the Department of Agricultural Rural Development. We actually worked really strongly with the the field staff there to hear what they wanted, what they are interested in or their farmers are interested in. And so so we like I guess quinoa we bought bought in as like that didn't come from Vietnam as an idea, but but everything else is pretty much that the farmers were interested or the DAD staff have seen it growing somewhere else and wondered, is that possible? And so so yeah, it's ground up a lot of the cases, but we had the literature there to sort of feeling well, this should work and that should work or when we didn't want to we didn't want to reinvent the wheel. So if you know people have grown tomatoes, then fine, we already know you can do that. And and just a quick follow up was the is a general generally crops that are grown in the Mekong Delta already because sometimes you also mentioned new crops. So what's the the mix between crops that maybe not those farmers, but that were kind of common in the Mekong Delta and completely new ideas? Yeah, the beetroot's new and quinoa's new. So yeah, so they're out there are newbies. But yeah, the the cowpea we were really keen to get a legume in the system. Soybean was recommended from DAD and we with our sort of knowledge of the literature, we tested soybean, but knowing that it's only moderate salt tolerance and consequently it failed. So looking then they they're interested in the legume. What can we find that fits that growing calendar? And it's you know, shorter duration was also a big requirement trying to get something that can get through its reproductive phases and avoid those abiotic stresses. So cowpea was was great because it's a multipurpose crop and finding crops that have beyond one benefit, whether it's because it's a legume or it could be used as a forage crop or it could be harvested as a bean consumed as a vegetable. Those sorts of things became appealing and then the farmers really got on board with that, which is great. So it's sort of a yeah, you know, the suggestions are passed in and we try and optimise what crops might suit that. And if it's if there's longer term legacy effects as well through nitrogen fixation, I mean, what a win for the system. Okay, so so it's a it's a mixed methods approach. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. Okay, great. Mike, you've been very patient. Yeah, thanks very much. And thank you for a very interesting presentation. My angle comes from the aquatic side, the the fishy side, rather than crops, but of course, recognising that the the integrated systems, rice fish and other crops fish, are of course, interesting for for delta environments today. And on another one CG program called ACN. And we're looking at, among other things, regenerative agriculture, which involves soil health. And some time back James Quilty, who you know from ACIR asked me and others to evaluate a rice shrimp project, which I think you were also involved with. Okay. CSU has taught be a that we need this but I'm not sure how far that got developed after that project ended but we had it set up we got it to a point where we had the structure there it functioned but like any any decision support system it's value improves with data going into it and so I'm not sure how much has happened since the project ended okay thank you and the next question part of the question is have you come across something called a bio func tool it measures soil health by gathering a range of soil properties to give a prediction about soil health short answer no but one of the things that we've we work with the farmers because we initially started with training programs to train the farmers about salinity as a as a because it's such a high risk factor for cropping and what came out of that was actually they need just soil soil health training and so it was amazing what the farmers could tell you about their soil just from their observations like we keep growing rice and the yields keep going down we keep putting more fertilizer on but the yields keep going down uh but when we grow these alternative crops everything changes and the next you know the next rice crops better and and so they they put it together they realize that soil health is really important but they don't know much about it and so we have changed our training from salinity training to soil training soil constraint training and um and that's we've done it and you'll have to forgive us for just being Australian people working with Australian farmers and understanding what that's like uh we've used the models that we know work with our farmers and took them to Vietnam and the Vietnamese team like oh this isn't going to work like no one's interested in this stuff you won't get farmers engaged in this we have to look trust me it works farmers love this stuff and we did it and the farmers engaged and the the dad people oh we've never seen farmers engage like this you know and so farmers are farmers they they understand the soil they understand like they want to know more about it if they don't know they want to learn and so so that was um that i don't know the bio fun tool i'm not familiar with it but anything that it links soil fertility or soil health to a farmer is is going to work i think yeah as long as it's hands-on okay two two quick extra questions the chameleon tool what's its lifespan uh good question it depends where and in what conditions it's being used the uh creator of the chameleon is is called um richard sterzacker he's wonderful and he continues to develop the product and um takes feedback uh from from a whole world like range of developing countries that are utilizing the chameleon uh he's had chameleon sensors last one cropping season he's had them last five cropping seasons so it's it's finding what parameters affect those um and why they would disintegrate quicker he has work on extra durable sensors that are thicker and he's working on coatings and different things like that to you know expand their um longevity we've got two years out of them yeah but the the actual sent the the computer part of the sensor will you know will last for a very long time it's just the actual sensors that go in the ground that may need replacing and they're they're very cheap so one last question uh have you looked at genetically modified crops for saline resistance we haven't no and and there would be you would have to do a bit of work with finding policies um and how that matches in the systems okay yeah great thank you very much thank you thanks montham thank you i see these chameleon sensors by the way can i ask roughly yep so the card the chameleon card is about fifty dollars australian with that comes with three sensors already and um the wi-fi is is 150 200 but looking at um so they're actually produced in africa which is where richard started a lot of his work in tanzania and countries like that trying to um solve water crisis issues there which is there's some great work that he's doing and developed a factory um there so there's they're working on trying to get them the price lower each time and more accessible for farmers yeah so those cards are our go-to for the farmers because it's it's you know economically viable for them yeah yeah i just see a question in the chat um from stephan i think about natural inoculum of the cowpea there is no current available viable inoculum that's commercial in in the delta but we have found nodulation and we're doing work on identifying and and um looking at salt tolerant rhizobium so there's there's a space there which is exciting and and it's great that the cowpea that we sewed had had nodules when we when we looked at them which is which is great a great sign thanks there's also another question in the chat and that's also a question i had regarding the salinity levels in the different uh sites that you had you mentioned four provinces so it's it's probably it's it's a gradient because it's up up rather upstream to coast um did you i mean target the crops to the different levels and what would what's your how how did you do that and what are the levels that's me answer questions yep so in socktrang they're oh they can get up to so the vietnamese use grams per liter so um the canal the sluice gates will shut at four grams per liter of of the water irrigation water so that was the basis that we used in determining if a crop would be suitable understanding that soil salinization over the the you know course of the dry season that can get a lot worse and solute potentials and things like that so if if a crop can't handle that um it's sort of out of the equation but we were finding um canal ec up to i think there's been 14 15 desi siemens recorded um we've got data that sort of says eight and nine um in in those areas of the peak dry season and then um that sort of trend follows slower in the lag with the soil yeah and so and so using mulch and and irrigating we can we can minimize the solute potential even though there's salt present we can minimize the effect of the solute potential so we can still get the plants to grow without that mulch there of course you get the evaporation then salts concentrate the solute potential will kill the plant but the other thing is our because of the nature of the problem uh it's quite normal to grow these plants when there is no salinity but the salinity comes as they grow so it's the end of their you know it's like brooke says the reproductive phase if you get the salinity then that's the problem and so the the duration of that that crop becomes really important because you can with the right short duration you can miss the salinity risk you can actually have your crop harvested before the salinity comes in but where where where we've done trials in the field you know we've we've got even though like brooke said like they you'll shut the sluice gate at four grams per litre um with evaporation and then even irrigation followed by evaporation you'll get higher salinities in the soil and and they will harm the sensitive crops for sure so that's in provinces where there are sluice gate protection we've got other provinces where the sluice gates are so effective that you don't get salinity coming in but you you've you've effectively got a trapped water source and so water scarcity becomes an issue so salinity uh even though our project is was focused on salinity is it's actually in some provinces it's water scarcity is the problem so these alternative crops are still better than rice because it's a different risk profile different water use uh and so it's still much more sensible to grow an alternative crop than it is to try to grow rice in the in the dry season when you've got a limited amount of fresh water available to you um and then that's why the chameleons are so important because you you optimize that water use efficiency so you're not wasting water and then there's more water to to go around within those trapped enclosed systems yeah maybe you can come in here yes so go ahead yes um so i also would like to acknowledge uh this very nice presentation brooke and jason as what i really liked was that you always had explanations also you made it an overview and you had always examples so it was really nice and you also showed us your own lessons you learned so i'm really valuing this in your presentation and i was quite triggered by one that one of you said that it's very important the principles of how to implement and adopt and then i thought um yeah is this something one should go further with as it's it's really this type of thinking of uh what is needed why we are doing this uh why not that uh coming to this point of uh yes uh irrigation every day that is uh maybe common practice but it's not a best practice uh and so this uh working with with people in this food system uh more looking into the principles of how doing things so how thinking it through so not coming up to solutions saying okay now use beetroot and then uh so many days before or after tet but uh yeah more go into this way of doing things yeah thank you yeah and it's interesting like and and i'm living off i only really worked in vietnam uh as my international experience but the farmers there they'll see something work and just pick up and go with it and so uh the willingness you know you go from literally going from hey um let's consider growing alternative crop instead of rice because rice is risky and then they see it and now let's grow two alternative crops and it's like whoa just calm down like maybe we just get one right first but they they're wanting to keep going faster and faster and so um you know being there to be able to support that interest and that enthusiasm but also protect people from perhaps the risks that come with with changing so rapidly um but so there's a balance there with dealing with the individual the individuals right i think that's the key to it like you you you've got to tap into that enthusiasm and and and uh they're there uh it might be their age and stage and and who's there to farm with them or what their goals are um become become really important and we you talk about learning which we've spoken about a little bit there's so much learning involved in it but um of course but uh when we when we see the farmers with around our field trial and their neighbours then want to get involved and they start expanding out um then you start we have the it's it's uh because if they're not going to grow that alternative crop and they want to grow rice well now we've got a hydrology conflict you know because some people want to have flooded fields next to something that needs to be drained and so those issues become become important yeah yeah yeah and maybe even other things like um you have less rice but you need uh the rice as a as a mark so and and if you use the rice as a mark what are you not doing with rice that you may have done before so then there are always uh yeah a lot of things to to be looked into whether with one that is very good you are causing something else where maybe something is missing at the end so that this it's really these uh discussions about trade-offs what what we are using and in what way yeah yeah in bangladesh in one of the projects we've uh quite interestingly com had a profitability analysis combined with the risk analysis and then you can also see okay some some cropping systems may have higher profit but also have a higher risk and that's that's i mean important to to balance um we're running out of time i would like to still ask you uh what's your what are your next steps what's what's coming next are you going for a second phase how long is the project running what's your do you have a scaling strategy what is next in your vision so we we're roughly halfway through um and like we we started in the covert period so it was a pretty rough start but um luckily the team at canto uni um did a lot of work um good work that got the project loaded off in the right direction earlier so that was good we're about halfway through and so what we what we are looking at doing now is is our struggle like brooke said in her presentation that that fitting timing into a cropping calendar is very crucial and so we want to do more work around timing timing of sewing and timing of these land management practices and preparation uh and and i think um we need to probably start factoring in some like modeling um you know climatic conditions into that and and and factoring that into the outcomes and sort of using our field trials to validate those models um so we need to do that we need to at the moment all of our fertility is based on what is common practice in the area which is largely coming off what people do if they grow maize um and so there's a fair bit of optimization to be had in that space um but yes moving forward so this project ends in mid 2025 um and so we are looking at at developing a new project that uh still looks at uh using alternative crops developing further on what we've been doing like brooke says focusing on legumes a little bit more and of course um vietnam like every other country in the world you know um soil carbon greenhouse gas emissions have to be factored into that and so so um looking at the benefits that our improved systems with these alternative crops that deliver benefits for the farmers but also benefits for the system and quantifying some of those as well so that that can be used so it's quantified it's known that if farmers change to this practice then these are the benefits um that come from it social as well as you know physical yeah very interesting thank you i'm sure uh you'll get that uh work funded um i also hope that we keep on engaging and maybe even uh try and formalize a collaboration uh in more detail uh in the future um for now thank you very much for the presentation it was very enjoyable and the next delta talks i'm not exactly sure if we have a date already uh we have in about four weeks the international rights congress coming up and the whole world of course is uh very busy with that and focuses on that so i'm not sure if that is maybe in the way and we need to find an alternative date we will announce that asap yes so thank you everybody for participating uh thanks for the opportunity it's great to see you again too thank you okay thank you bye thank you bye bye thank you bye bye thank you thank you uh Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
