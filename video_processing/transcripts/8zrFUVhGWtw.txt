 Hello, I am Nambal. My name is my good partner. My main theme is National Forming. My subject is National Forming. And National Forming is divided into the types. One is National Forming and one is Adromalacharya. Natural Forming is a practice of growing crops in the industry. It is introduced and developed by Dix and Dixer in 1999. He was the environmental health scientist in Colombia in New York. As you can see, in the water plant, it will supply water to the other portion of the plant. Without missing, you can dip it down. Now the water is transported to the plant. So we are using here the dripping system. The dripping system will help the plant for the supply of water. The dripping system means we are inserting balls to the plants. And along with the water, we are adding manually this clean soil to water. It will give nutrients to the plants. Hydroponic form. Hydroponic form. Hydroponic form is a plant which grows in the water. That is called hydroponic form. It is demonstrated by John Sachs in the year of 1967. But I want to explain how the plant will grow. Here, we have set up one of the plants. In the last day of this is water. It will force the water to the upper canal and it will flow to the air canal. Why we have ironed the acanolite? For the easing of the water. When the easing of the water, then you can add it. Organic and fresh manure. So we are using manure mix. It is prepared by the cow dung. It is purified in this plant. And we will get the liquid water. That we are spraying to the plants. It will help the plants away from the insecticides. And next is panchagalaya. Panchagalaya. Panchagalaya is a natural fertilizer. It will boost the plant growth. It helps to control the pests. It helps to the good fruits and good production. And the seeds and the seeds. And the seeds of the plants are not the fruit and the seeds. And the seeds. First we have to mix the fruit and the ghee for 4 days. And we have to decompose it for 4 days. After decomposing it for 4 days, we have to add all the products. And we have to decompose it for 10 days or 2 days. And we have to keep the fruit and the seeds. And we have to keep the fruit and the seeds. And then panchagalaya is helpful for the plant's fertility. Next one, what is the panamut? Next question is self watering system. Imagine if you are going to a drip for 1 or 2 weeks. There is a doubt that the plants will dry. The doubt is clear that it rises by adoption of these types of citrus. Next type of citrus. We are taking a box and inserting it. In that hole, the water plant should be correctly flexible. And we have to add water in the box. And in the water plant on the base, we have to put holes and we have to put the good water absorbed such as cotton and wood. We are promoting cotton for absorption of water. And the cotton will absorb water and it helps the soil to moisture. When the soil is moisture, the roots will absorb the moisture necessarily soil. If you want to add any organic water such as it is liquid or liquid soil. If it is in soil state, we can directly soil in the soil. If it is in the liquid state, we can directly flower in the water and it is absorbed by the water and it is literally absorbed by the roots. And for benefits of vertical farming, nowadays we can see soil fertility is decreasing day by day. So we have to promote these types of farming for good yield for farmers. Who are the small and marginal farmers. They have to promote these types of farming. Who are putting high income in the chemical inputs. They have to promote these types of farming. And it is only natural. It will not damage our environment. It is eco-friendly in the nation. So that finally we want to conclude that we have to promote these types of systems in our country for the protection of our environment. Thank you. Thank you.
