farmer every uh aspiring peak farmer to know before you're delving or thinking about getting into big farming 10 different mindsets 10 different mindset i want you to have yes so number one number one uh is i want every big uh aspiring people to ask yourself a very important question and the question is are you really ready for this are you ready for peak farming uh do you feel peak farming is meant for you because just like you may have understood about life generally not everything is meant for everyone there are certain things that some people are meant to do some other people are not meant to do so you need to ask yourself are you ready for this that is this aspect of business is this aspect of agriculture meant for you are you able to handle these challenges is it something you are passionate about is this something you will give everything to you will put in your best or is this something you just feel like uh experimenting on so you need to understand that everything in life and peak farming is not an exception it all requires extreme passion you have to be passionate about what you do you have to put in 100 100 into it so it's not going to be don't feel it's going to be a cakewalk where you just uh leave your peaks in a pen and uh voila that's it and uh the money keeps rolling in it's not like that there are lots of intricacies that you have to understand about peak farming that you have to uh be prepared for before you get into it so that you don't have heartbreaks so please the first question the first mindset you have to ask yourself while you're watching lots of videos on how much money they made from people and everything is to ask yourself are you ready for this is it meant for you is it something you are meant to do so that's number one mindset number two is what's your business plan you have to have a business plan i think i've told you i've been saying this in some um previous videos i've been to certain fans and uh honestly if those were the if those are the people you look up to you would not want to get into the family because uh they are not in business i can tell you 100 if you do good audits on their farm you would discover that these guys are not in business they just have a farm they just have their farm they have animals there but they are not in business so you have to have a business plan what's your business plan what do you you him to do now let me just walk you through some certain mindset around the business plan you could have for instance do you want to be a breeder that means do you want to have breeders on your farm do you want to be the person that brings in uh that um produces the piglets on your alone or do you want to be a breeder and be a partner that means do you want to pick up the piglets also and also grow them to maturity you have to have a business plan you have to have a very solid business plan what do you aim to do don't just get there and just take pigs and just start wearing them ask yourself what do you enjoy there are different aspects of this thing for some people now all they do is buy the piglets they buy the piglets and they fix the piglets somewhere they wear them up in about six months after six months they dispose them they get new piglets that's a business plan so these guys those guys that do such thing they are not interested in having breeders at all all they are interested in is to have uh if a repeatable breeder farm where they will get their piglets from every uh every time they they have in uh they are available and they are interested in having and put them in a pen get the feed feed them uh take them to maturity and dispose them that's a business plan okay if you don't want that plan probably you just want to be a breeder hello that means your own job is just to give piglets out to other farmers so all you have to do is to have the breeders the sow and the boa uh and uh you call for farmers uh neighboring farmers to pick piglets from you every now and then there's a woman i know that's literally what she's major majored in uh recently on this farm we got piglets from her from that farm she don't keep she hardly keeps any pig till six months or or there about what she has about i don't know how many uh female pigs she has very great pigs very good breed and uh she has the she has the tea and she has the uh africa the south african large white and she has a good boa she just has uh the pen she has is not it's not a very big farm but at least she has i think probably almost hit um breeder females so all she do is produce the piglets people come around pick the piglets from her and that's great and she's doing well uh we did the estimate of how much you'll be making every year she's making solid money there she's not rearing anything up to six months she uh after uh having the winners maybe uh five weeks six weeks she disposes all of them get the breeders ready for uh mating again and then get them uh bread and then she makes new piglets again that's a business plan okay and you can do both you can decide to have your breeders maybe you have four females and then you decide to uh get piglets out of them after you get piglets out of them you raise the piglets to six months so in that case now everything has to be well planned don't go into this without having a solid plan if not you would you would just uh find yourself having lots of heartbreaks because you will be you you would be one of the people that would get into the family and get out a lot of people come in and get out in just like how almost every other i got your adventure is lots of people delve in especially when they watch lots of videos and this round they get delve out because they didn't have a plan so they were they were not able to uh uh to face the challenges that came with whatever they were working with now i go with the next mindset and that's have a good budget uh have a good budget you see your plan your business plan must be dependent on the budget you have you know one of the reasons why you need to have a good budget is for instance now you need to know that uh pig farming is capital intensive it's these guys don't uh they don't hit grasses like that you can't feed them on grass like that just like the good good farm good farming where you could literally get them to graze on free grasses and everything these guys you have to house them housing them after you're done housing then you have to feed them in the morning in the afternoon so it's a capital intensive business so you have to be ready you have to be ready for all these costs you cannot get the pigs into your farm and malnourish them and expect to be in business have a good budget make sure before you get into um people you know what you are getting into you know the cost you are getting into how much would you need to raise a single piglet from one month to six months if you know how much that is then you understand okay how much do you have how much are you if do you have how much capital do you have available for you do you think you can raise 10 piglets or do you think you can raise 20 that should be what should be your driving force your budget don't get into this and just probably you just see animals somewhere and they told you that uh the animals are quite cheap and you just feel oh i saw this opportunity let me get 20 of them and you get 20 of them and then you can't raise them and then you are out of business and then you are struggling and you're having real issues and the pigs can't eat and they are catching diseases and they are not uh attaining the right kg uh a pig was i know of a farmer that sold his pigs after i think over six months those pigs did not some of those pigs did not weigh 50 kg after six months after over six months peace did not weigh uh 50 kg i don't know if you of course if you're an aspiring people you may not understand how terrible that is but you see this piece you're looking at in this video on this farm they are less than they are uh more like let me just say about three months on this farm they are weighing some of them will be weighing if not at least probably 40 kg already and somebody had uh pigs for over six months and could not attain maybe i think maybe he got 48 kg or there about in some of them or 46 or there about and he has been keeping these pigs for a lot of time that's exactly what i'm saying have a good budget know exactly what you're getting into because you need to plan for the right fit you can't plan for wrong feet you can't plan for just pkc so that's what i'm telling you please have a right budget so that you won't get out of business soon enough number four start small grow big start small grow big please you need to know this if you have a lot of money to raise uh maybe 100 pigs i beg you don't go for 100 pigs initially if you're a new pig farmer please decide to go for a little number first no matter how much resources you have available to you please start small and grow big there is a reason for that it's not it's not money is not the only issue in pig farming you need to understand management management is also very important you need to understand there are challenges that may come to hit to to to your farm your location may have some certain uh challenges that you may not be aware of some certain things that you may not be aware of you may have issues with your workers you may have issues with your water supply so it may not just be that oh you didn't have money that was why your farm had issues it could be some other things that you have no power over and that's what i'm saying start small and grow big if you have the money i would advise you that no matter how much money you have make sure you don't start with more than 10 females honestly that's even so much imagine having 10 females on your farm if those females give bad you could literally have 100 piglets from just one bed in like uh four months in four months time if you bring in matured females on your farm you could have you could literally have 100 piglets in four months and that's a lot of money if you consider breeding those guys still six months so you need to be very much ready for whatever you are going into but please start small and grow big number five focus on your animals improve structures later now i understand the importance of structures in pig farming i want you to know that i understand it i understand the importance of a very solid structure and i'm not saying you should build a less solid structure but be very careful of not going into lots of designs and all these things initially of course when you make great profit on it you can go on to making a lot of improvements in your structures you can go on to um building with using high on and all those things but if you are an intending pig farmer and your budget is not very large of course if you have the money you can go for good structures and of course it would not mean anything to you but if you are having to if you are having to uh juxtapose between your animals or your structures i would advise you every time anytime every day that you should focus on your animals focus on their feeds focus on their drugs on their medication focus on their water supply focus on those things don't focus so much on if you look around this farm see some people use you you could have seen some of our videos where we made use of bamboo sticks to do the uh the partitioning see those animals are doing fine inside of course that's not the best that's not the best structure of you if you could if you could look at let me try and show you if you can look at this you can look over there you would see woods being used to partition the uh the uh pen over there of course if you if you have money spend the money but i would advise you if you are if you have to juxtapose between what you should spend your money on your animals or the structure focus on the animals you can use you you need to learn how to improvise you need to learn how to be resourceful do lots of things with uh materials around you don't focus too much on i need to make everything solid with cement the cement bags are very expensive so if you can do anything with whatever resources you have around you please do it and focus on your animal health focus on them eating properly focus on them eating the right amount of protein focus on all those things and you will never get it wrong in peak farming so please focus on your animals improve structures later if need be number six as i said already just to emphasize on it be resourceful try and improvise on certain things you don't have to always spend money you don't have to always spend money it's not every time you have to look for uh the most modern way of handling something be uh resourceful try and improvise try and uh get uh things around your area try and look for things that would lessen your cost the aim for a good business uh activity is for you to have lessened cost so that your your your your profits can come out from there you don't have to spend too much on your business so instead of you running around looking for the most modern thing right there you can see we're using the walu system i so much love the nipple drinker i believe you have seen an improvised uh way of doing the nipple drinker that was released uh some some you should have seen it in one of our videos on how to uh improvise the nipple drinker using a bucket those are some of the things i'm talking about you need to find a way around all these things don't be too focused on spending money uh on just everything you need to learn how to be resourceful resourcefulness is the ultimate resource resource is the ultimate resource so number seven market research cannot be overemphasized your market research if you are new to peak farming i understand you may have seen so many things on the media talking about all you need to uh understand about uh uh peak farming and how much uh it has good sales but please understand your location and understand what your location needs you need to make sure that your location is in demand for this thing don't be too carried away with what you see on the internet market research cannot be overemphasized before you get into into peak farming go around your area and find out what's the demand for pigs in your area and what size are they are they in demand for what do people need what do people require are people searching for the piglets so before you think about going into breeders farm ask yourself is are people is the demand for piglets in your area is it very solid you have lots of farmers looking for piglets before you decide to be a breeder farmer and ask yourself also if you want to wear it to six more like what's the number what's the number of pigs that you think you will be able to dispose in a month so that you don't have 100 pigs and the demand is 50. so you need i understand that in some places the demand has not been met but be sure that that's the case in your area for ask yourself where are you locating your farm and how long how what you what will it take for you to transport your animals from your farm to wherever the market is you know obviously markets will be somewhere somewhere but you have the right resources to transport your animals from where you are if there are there are no markets in area to where market is these are important things you need to pay attention to so number eight invest in knowledge invest in knowledge train your workers you see it is uh deception real deception if somebody tells you all you need to do is just to get pigs and put them in a place and that's all that's real deception i'm telling you it doesn't work that way you need to have somebody somebody somebody somewhere that is an expert somebody that you can always reach out to somebody that you can always call upon you could go get to your farm one morning and you will see your pigs acting out you can see you could decide you you could discover some certain things that you've never experienced before
