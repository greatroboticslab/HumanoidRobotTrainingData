 Music What's in this field here Don? This is sweet potatoes that we had just planted. Okay. We planted some of them a week ago and then the ones that are being irrigated now we planted yesterday. Okay. And it's very important if you don't get rain after you're planting to, if you don't have irrigation, it makes it real difficult for the plants to get established after you plant them. You've got your tractor hooked up to a pump? It's hooked up to a water pump that runs on a PTO. Okay. Power takeoff. Power takeoff. Okay. And it produces about 110 gallons of water a minute. So this is a pump. That's the power takeoff comes out the back of the tractor. And you can use that power takeoff for any number of things right? Oh yeah. It's used to run most. Most anything? Most applications behind the tractor. Okay. They're all, if it requires a PTO they're all adapted to a tractor. Okay. Okay. And that thing actually moves, is that correct? You've got it on our cable and it... Yeah, it winches itself across the field. That's why they call it a water winch. A water winch. Ah, okay. Because it drags a hose behind it and we hook it to a tree and it winches itself across the field. Nice. It's got three different gears on it. And depending upon how dry it is... Oh, as far as the speed goes? Yeah, as far as the speed goes. So that's how you regulate how much water you put down, is by how fast it winches across? Right, it's got one, two and three and if I put it in the fastest gear, I can put a half an inch of rain on. See how far you get a dig, Bill? Before you get any moisture. Not even hitting it yet. So these are, these are, now these are red potatoes? What kind of... These are red potatoes. Can I get you to hold those up again? I wish I had a hill that had more on it. Here, I'm going to put both of these together. There you go. You say these are potatoes that, this is what potatoes look like when they need a little rain. Yep. Okay. See these, actually, if we did not get any more rain. Yeah. Or like, let's say this crop didn't get water any time this week. Uh huh. And we didn't get irrigation on it. Then what would happen is, these small potatoes would size up as long as the vines are still green. Okay. That's how they would size up. But that's not what you want. You want your potatoes to size up with moisture rather than from the vine. Oh, in other words, it would be taking the moisture out of the vine there. It would be, that's, and then when the vine is dead, the potatoes are done growing. Okay. There's at least, at least a good month's growth here. Yeah. Where these potatoes could size, this potato being, uh, not much bigger than a marble. Right. Would, could size up to the size of your fist by the time it's to be harvested. So that rain is really critical right now. Very critical. So, some people go to Las Vegas to gamble and you choose to farm I guess, huh? That's exactly right. Wow. So here's the potatoes that we get at the farmers market. Nice. If, if we don't get any rain, if this storm misses us tomorrow night, I'll have to set up irrigation over here and that's going to take me a day or two. Wow. At this point every day is critical. Sure. Great. So maybe, maybe Mother Nature will be kind to us tomorrow night. One hopes so. How many feet long are these? The greenhouse is 128 feet long. 128 feet long and you've got all tomatoes in here. All tomatoes. And this box that you've got in here, what is that? That box down there is a beehive. It's a beehive. It's got bumble bees in it. Okay. And that's how we pollinate the tomatoes. Okay. When the flowers, flowers like this, when they open up the bee pollinate, maybe with a little luck we might see some bees pollinating. Okay. And then again we may not, it depends on what the humidity is in here. Right. And they only pollinate when the humidity is just ripe. Oh is that right? But sometimes you'll still see them flying around pollinating. And it looks like the more ripe tomatoes are at the bottom. Is that? At the bottom. And as they ripen then you just, you'll be picking this cluster next week. The next week you'll be picking off of this cluster. So they ripen from the bottom and then they keep on growing. They grow up. They grow up to these spools that are on a string. Okay. And as they grow, you take and let them down like that and move them to the right. That's what they call leaning and lowering. I've never heard of that. And then the vines eventually at the end of the season, they'll have a big long column of vines. You can see they've been lowered quite a few times already. So the vines are all leaning this way. And you've already picked the tomatoes off the bottom. They've already been picked off the bottom. Okay. Like several weeks back. So you give them a little bit of slack with the reel and move them to the right. Just like a domino effect. And when they reach the end? Because they get down the empty row. Then you turn them and send them the other day. and what are they planted in they're planted in a media called pearlite pearlite pearlite okay it's a white media it comes out of volcanoes oh and then it felt like a vermiculite or exactly and that's in the same family as that it takes the place of soil okay then how does it get watered they take it out of volcanoes and then they pop it just like popcorn oh wow and then it turns into this I didn't realize that it makes a good media base for soil I did not realize that and it really holds water well and how does it get watered through these feed tubes each tomato plant has its own feed tube wow so they have plenty of water and it's all put on a chidal okay that's what they call cat facing cat facing cat facing and it's due to cold temperatures during pollination interesting right after pollination okay so that's that tomato was formed way back in February very small tomato and that's why it turned out that way cat facing interesting so this is the strawberry this is how we grow the strawberries we grow them in stackers like this this is an ever bearing variety and this now they're held up with pipes and then you've got this black pipe is what water this is a feed tube and then they're just put on stackers that we evolved so when you're picking you can just spin this like you can oh very convenient like a miniature carousel you might say yeah and uh here's there's one that being an ever bearing variety we'll see what the summer brings on sure sure nice and this is the same way we grow our greens for the winter time oh is it right is that right winter farmers market oh in stackers like this okay this is probably this is probably equivalent to um maybe uh uh several acres of greens outside sure because of the way we grow because of the vertical stacking exactly perfect and it's and the same with the strawberry operation sure that little uh half acre of stackers is probably equivalent to like five six acres of strawberries that's amazing and the tomatoes the same thing wow same thing wow would be equivalent to wow that particular house of tomatoes would probably be equivalent to about 50 acres of tomatoes wow all those all those is it all right if we try one well we all enjoy your your produce at the farmers market and we certainly appreciate you taking the time today to show us around oh well it was a pleasure was all mine okay thanks don you um you Thank you.
