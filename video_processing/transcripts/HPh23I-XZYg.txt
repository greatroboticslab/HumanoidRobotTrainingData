Science & Technology
 It's time to start this, let's say, disappointment within the Cedric webinar initiatives. And actually, the Cedric webinar initiatives derived from, let's say, a project, which is the Cedric project that has been financed by the Inter-Record Italia-Austria and co-founded by the European Union. The Cedric project involves several entities as the ICGEB as coordinator, leading partner, then University of Udine, the Free University of Bolzano, the University of Innsbruck, and then other, let's say, project partners like the CCHIP group, Echenbichler, the Biotreat and ERSA. Basically, the title of the project is Creating of a Sustainable Cross-Border Agroecosystem by Leveraging Root Microbiome Biodiversity. And the main aim of Cedric is to strengthen the microbiological biodiversity of areas and soils characterized by a poor or an altered microbial ecosystem. Basically, the main aim of the Cedric project is to develop and validate methods, let's say, concerning the root microbiome transplantation. And the other, let's say, main aspects are related to the creation of a platform for agricultural, scientific and business stakeholders in order to promote the transnational and scientific knowledge to sustainable methods applicable in the field. And also to develop the training program, training program and dissemination programs, which are focused on the role of healthy microbiome in soil ecosystem and agricultural productivity and all the benefits associated with this with this aspect. So, let's say, related to this last point, we had, let's say, the task and the honor to develop this series of webinars, which basically follow under three main, let's say, big topics, which are the soil health and the biodiversity, the bioinoculants for agriculture and the sustainability and science communication. And in particular, the seminar we will have, we will have, we will have, we will have here today by Lucrezia Lamastria is within this last topic. And in this table, you can see, let's say, the program of the webinar we are going to, let's say, to give or to organize in the next future. And after the seminar of today, given by Lucrezia, the next appointment will be on the next 6th of February, in which our, let's say, project partner, Silvia, will give a very interesting seminar about biostimulant. So, to introduce our today's seminar, I would like also to introduce Lucrezia. Lucrezia Lamastra graduated in chemistry and pharmaceutical technology at the University of Turin in 2005. Lucrezia Lamastra graduated in chemistry and she obtained a PhD degree in 2010 by, from the University, the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Piacenza. And currently she is associate professor in agricultural chemistry at the same university. And during her career, basically, she developed a growing interest in sustainability. And this led her to coordinate and participate in different nationally relevant projects. In particular, over the last decades, her research has been dedicated to examining the, let's say, the complex relationship between agriculture, food production, consumption and environmental sustainability. And her activities has basically, basically been focused on assessing the impact of water usage and climate change within the food production system. And to, let's say, to pursue her research objectives, basically, she applied a multidisciplinary approach involving chemical analysis, environmental modeling and LCA methodology. And that has been basically employed to evaluate and to mitigate environmental impacts, providing valuable insights into enhancing the sustainability of the food system. So before leaving the floor to Lucrezia, I would like to make some, let's say, practical recommendations. So I would like all the participants to invite all the participants to make sure that their microphones are muted during the presentation. And at the end of the presentation, the webinar, we will have a question and answer session. And so if you have a question, you can, let's say, you can book your slot by raising the hand or by typing the question in the chat. And I would also like to remind you that the webinar is recorded. And so the recording will be shared on the project website soon after the end of the of this event. So with this, I stop sharing my screen and I leave the floor to Lucrezia. Okay, good morning to everyone. Thank you, Yuri, for introducing me and for inviting me to present today into this seminar. So I'm starting to share my screen. So during this presentation, I will give you also some questions to you in order to interact with. So during the presentation and not only at the end, when Yuri and Maria invited me to present into this seminar, I didn't know the audience and I selected to be more general about the topic of my research. that are, as Yuri introduced, related to the measure of sustainability in the agri-food sector. In the case in which my presentation is basic, you can stop me and we will move to the last slide in which I will go farther into the results of my research. But for me, it's important also to introduce the topic in which we, the background in which we developed, the way in which we are able today to measure sustainability. So let's free to stop me if it's really too basic for you. So first of all, we have to introduce what is a sustainable agriculture. In 30 slides, you can see the definition provided by FAO. So sustainable agriculture is not only crossing the four and the three dimensions of sustainability, environmental, social and economics, but contributes also to all the four pillars of food security. So availability, access, utilization and stability. As you can see here, there are five key principles of sustainability for food and agriculture that are presented into the slides and are increased productivity, protecting the national resources, improve the livelihood and foster inclusive economic growth, enhance the resilience of people, communities and ecosystems and adopt the governance to the new challenges. So, but if now today in 2025, we are speaking about sustainability is probably because we are aware that we are not so sustainable today. So I start with a question. So, you have to take your phone and count your code in order to enter into the system. Okay, three people, four people. Okay, three people, four people. Okay, I will wait at least 20 people to start. Okay, so we start in order to start. So we start in order to avoid to this time. The first question is about the planetary boundaries identified by Rockstrom et al in 2009. Okay. Okay, most of you answered correctly. One of the nine planetary boundaries identified by Rockstrom. It was the loss of genetic diversity. Okay, the fastest was Monica. And the second question is about the current concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere. The second question is about the ship that is going to be affair that Commander S Footageitan was in the South Island the state of inferiormaan realît storage for Theparre zweite. Dr.co. I thought in this case, most of you answered it correctly. So we move again to the the slides in which as you can see here we have a picture taken from the very famous publication of rockstrom et al in in 2009 in which they defined the safe operating space for humanity setting nine planetary boundaries uh in 2009 three of these nine planetary boundaries have been crossed and were the one about the emissions of carbon dioxide the rate of biodiversity loss and the one about the nitrogen use so the amount of nitrogen removed from the atmosphere in this publication they set the the proposed boundary and also they measured the delivery in which uh we were 16 years ago in respect to these proposed boundaries as you can see some of them like for instance the atmospheric aerosol loading or the chemical pollution have been defined as important but without having the proper way to measure them having a boundary and so without having a boundary it was also impossible to select what is the current status in respect to this boundary some years after the same group published another work that is a little bit an update of the first work of roxner methal in which some the concept of planetary boundaries first published in 2009 has been improved introducing some more boundaries and underlined again in this case that four of the nine planetary boundaries have been crossed the additional one is the one about the land system change and again has been defined that climate change and biosphere integrity the two uh are two uh core boundaries to define this safe space for humanity so considering that to measure climate change we have a lot of indicators we can start defining considering goals that and one of the planetary boundaries already crossed is the one about the concentration of carbon dioxide and the atmosphere we can start discussing about the climate change so as you probably know climate change is something of uh natural that the humans are able to improve increasing the emissions of greenhouse gases so this is uh so this is uh so this is uh so this is uh taken from the last report of the international intergovernmental panel on climate change and in this case is underlined again that human activities uh through the emissions of greenhouse gases and the global warming uh through the global warming uh uh and global surface temperature uh reaching 1.1 celsius degree above the level uh that we have before this is just to have a little introduction i have another questions for you i have another question for you is something that is written into this uh report and so why global surface temperature will continue i put again the qr code to increase them until at least the mid-century in all the media the global warming uh okay in this case we have a last answer but most of them are the correct one so um this is a one question based into some of the statements reported into the report i showed before so uh the question is why global surface temperature will continue to increase uh the the the the uh also if we imagine um scenarios in which emissions are reduced and this is why some of the greenhouse gases are very long lasting into the atmosphere and so also if we stop today to emit some of them we cannot completely stop our emissions of course the effect cannot be be immediate due to the lifetime of these gases into the atmosphere the atmosphere the atmosphere the atmosphere the atmosphere the atmosphere the atmosphere about the difference between mitigation and adaptation in addressing climate change and mitigation focuses on reducing the causes of the climate change and so the emissions of greenhouse gases while adaptation is to adapt to the effect of the climate change the end of so the ranking will be shown at the end so as you can see in the slide the mitigation is aimed at tackling the causes while adaptation is to reduce the effect so i added this definition just because into my presentation also the one that yuri made at the start i brought it at i worked to mitigate in some way or to find the best way to mitigate the effect of the climate change and so the work we are doing is to reduce the emission of some gases mainly greenhouse gases related to the agro food chain and so i'm going to move a little bit to some other topics uh here just to have an idea of what but it's better to i come back i will show you the questions because i'm very okay most of the cut through period because i babysit for returns to be avoided and theację journey is about about the statement of the conspiracy documentary please Okay. Here we will see why it's not completely true with this Britain. And I move to a previous question that is this one. What is the contribution of agriculture to global greenhouse gas emissions? Okay. So as you can see here, it is written, what is the contribution of agriculture to the global greenhouse gas emissions? While the other question was about the impact of the livestock sector. So if we move to the slides, you can see into this slide, what is the contribution of the agriculture, forestry and land use to the global greenhouse gas emission? These are results of some years ago, 2016, in which agriculture contributes to less than 20% of the overall emissions. Into the right, you can see how much are the emissions related to agriculture in Europe. And if you check in Europe, agriculture is contributing to less than 10% of the overall emissions of the greenhouse gases. So considering that livestock is part of this sector. So it's part of the... I'm sorry, but I'm into a class. And so we have also the birds. So as you can see here, agriculture accounts for the 20, more or less the 20% of the global level and the 10% at European level. So considering that livestock is part of this sector. It is impossible that... And it was included into the second question. The first one I asked you to answer that contributes to the health of the emissions overall. Overall, because livestock can be the health of the emissions related to agriculture and not the health of the overall emissions. So somewhere information are not always the proper ones. So if we move to the food sector, you can see that food does so the whole agri-food system, not just agriculture can contribute, can be slightly different considering different totours to the 26 or 30, 34% of the overall emissions. While these numbers are different from the previous one, because in this case we are considering not only the agricultural sector, but also the following phases. So the transformation, the transportation, the packaging, the cooking phase, and so on. So from the 20% to the 30% considering the agri-food system. And moreover, we have to consider that before, into the agricultural sector, there was included not only the agricultural production related to the food production, but also to other uses. So the agri-food system impacts more or less the 30% of our emissions. So climate change in yapmış large In cost of offshore performance, so people could not takeraisem into our technical order and givealım source for funding forSc hypn economies, but also to all. Okay, in this case we have a lot of answers, but not always correct. The first one is the correct one. So methane has higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide, but lower than nitrous oxide. So we will see into the following slides here. What are the global warming potential? So we have this global warming potential to transform each one of the greenhouse gases into carbon dioxide equivalents. And this table is taken from the IPCC report and report for each one of the greenhouse gases. The global warming potential considering different time frames. So 20 years, 100 years and 500 years. And for the first time in the last report, so the sixth report, the global temperature potential have been introduced into this report. So global temperature potential are different from the global warming potential because they considered how much the temperature will change at the end of the period of time. But now the scientific community is not always agree in using GDP instead of global warming potential. Also because the modeling to obtain this value is different and is more complicated. And because we have to consider how much the climate system responds to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. And there are a few works in which GDP is used instead of GWP. What is the main difference? The main difference is about the methane emissions. As you can see into this table, if we consider global warming potential 100 and we compare the value to the one of global temperature potential 100, you can see that we have 27 for the global warming potential and 4.7 for the global temperature potential. Why is this difference because methane has a very short lifetime into the atmosphere and so the effect into the temperatures, into the increase of temperatures using the GDP model are probably differently estimated, giving us these different values. So methane is more powerful than carbon dioxide, less powerful than nitrous oxide. These are the three main greenhouse gases related to agriculture, while the other greenhouse gases are more related to industrial uses because our refrigerants or fire extinguishers. So molecules used more into the industries or into the distribution phase, the refrigerant phase and so on. Here is a slide in which we have the comparison between results obtained for Australian capital carcass using two different matrix. So in this case, not the GTP, but GWP star. GWP star is another matrix similar to the one of the GTP. GTP is the one selected from the IPCC to be considered. GWP star is something of similar that consider differently the short-lived climate pollutants like methane, for instance. And into the future, probably we will find more works in which GWP star is used mainly into the livestock sector because as you probably know, the methane emissions are due to the intake fermentation and a different accounting of methane can give us different, completely different results. As you can see here in which using GWP star, as you can see into the right, we have a big reduction of the emissions due to the enteric methane. But how can we measure the impact of these numbers and these results like the one of the previous slide? How can we obtain the way in which we can obtain these results is considering the whole life cycle from the cradle to the grave? And now with some little example, I will try to explain why it is important to consider the whole life cycle and not only one of the phases or one of the indicators you have. Because I stressed now the importance of the greenhouse gas emissions, but we will see one indicator is not enough to pretend to measure the sustainability. So the question was that we can consider biofuel carbon neutral considering that the emissions of carbon dioxide we obtain after the combustion correspond exactly to the same amount of carbon dioxide as being stored during the carbon cycle into the plant. So, do you have to answer to this question? I will put again the question. Okay. Okay. We can't avoid to consider all the processes we have before. So, of course, the emissions we have during the combustion corresponds to the amount of carbon dioxide stored before into the plant. This is true. But to obtain these biofuels, we have to produce them. So, we have to have to grow the crops, to have a bio refinery system in which, for instance, biofuels are obtained. We have a distribution system. So, we cannot consider them completely carbon neutral. And moreover, this is another point that is very important. When doing life cycle assessment, we cannot consider just one indicators. There are a lot of works in focus that just into the greenhouse gas emissions or the water footprint and so on. But freely to measure the sustainability, to pretend to measure the sustainability of our food or crops, we need to consider more than one indicators. Because, for instance, in the case of biofuels, we have also the release of nutrients from fertilizers. We have other kind of inputs and impacts we can have related to the use of the production of biofuels. This is another example. This is taken from a works made in Sweden, in Sweden, in which they compare organic versus conventional crops, considering this case, the Witten piece. And considering what is the show into this picture, what is your opinion about? Well, for example, how do we process that? It depends into your opinion. depends is the proper answer is my favorite answer. So as you can see here, we have other picturing other works in which conventional and organic hot brains have been compared and results can be very different considering different indicators. This is why one indicator is not enough. And moreover, another important thing to be considered when doing a life cycle assessment is the selection of the functional unit. As you can see, we have into the table, table four, into the right, three different functional units. One is one tonne, one is one hectare and one other is 1000 Canadian dollar. So results can be different using different functional units. When doing a life cycle assessment, we cannot consider the quantity providing the same quantity, providing the same function, but we have to consider what is the function of the, of what we are analyzing in order to report the results related to the function and not to the quantity. For instance, one tonne can be, can be useful in the moment in which we are comparing something that the, in which the same quantity is able to provide the same function. But if we compare one tonne of tomatoes with one tonne of milk, the functions probably are not the same. And so we cannot exactly compare just using the quantity, different food products. So life cycle assessment, consider the whole life cycle from cradle to the grave. We cannot avoid it to consider what happened before and after, and moreover, consider a broad range of environmental issues. So using just one indicator is not enough to pretend to measure the sustainability of a production. Moreover, it's quantitative and based into models that are based on proven causalities. Life cycle assessment is based also on standards and the entity standards for different life cycle. In doing life cycle assessment, we have to follow four different steps. So the first one is golden scope definition followed by the inventory in which we collect data, the impact assessment in which we transform the data into the impact. And at the end of the interpretation, what is very critical is to select the functional unit as explained before, because this is the reference of the study. And we have to compare properly the function and not just the amount. This is the last question for you. I will stop it before the time. I will stop it before the time. Now we have a lot of different answers. The proper one is the second one now, because we cannot consider the function of food just to provide a certain amount of food, because one kilogram of meat is different from one kilogram of food from a nutritional point of view. If we have to compare two different foods, we have to compare the same nutritional content of this food. So this is why often it's difficult to evaluate the sustainability in the food sector. And there are a lot of works also supported by the FAO to find the proper nutritional functional unit in order to have a common way to assess the sustainability into the food sector. Just to show you an application in a few minutes of how lifecycle assessment can help us to assess the sustainability in agriculture. I will present you some data obtained in a project funded by the Italian Ministry of the Environment, in which my university has been involved since the start in 2010. So this program is called Viva, and it's based on indicators. What has been our work into this project? Our work has been to develop for indicators specific for the wine sector. The sustainability of the wine sector, that are in today's slides are called in Italian, but you can easily understand the translation, hair, water, vineyard and territory. So we developed the framework in which the sustainability of one sector can be assessed. Not only one indicator, but more than one. And also into territory, we added something related to economy and society, because we have to remember that sustainability cannot be just the environment from an environmental point of view. And after the evaluation, the ones that have the certification can show into the bottle, the label you can see into the right and the scanning of the QR code. It is possible to see the results that are obtained from the certified bottles and understand what are the impacts, for instance, into the greenhouse gas emissions. Into the water scarcity, into the vineyard due to the management of vineyard and also the ones related to the social economic part of the sustainability using the territory indicators. So this kind of instrument developed into the Viva framework can also be useful to compare, again, as we have seen before, to different ways to produce. Like for instance, into this work, we compare it again organic with conventional, in this case, viticulture. Again, results can be different considering different functional units. And the question is again, what is the best functional unit in this case? Is it better to consider the surface or the quantity of wine produced? Considering that the wine is the product that at the end is actually sold. So, results can be different considering different functional units, but also considering different indicators. So often to have an answer is not so easy as we thought at the start, because we have the instrument to measure, but the instrument sometimes provides some results difficult to be understood. So we have to evaluate differently the different results provided. Here is another work in which we applied, in this case, the path methodology. Path is the methodology developed by the European Commission to assess the sustainability following the life cycle assessment approach. In this case, we worked with different farms producing milk to produce Grana Padano, and we compared the impacts of the permanent middles farm, we have into the Mantua district in Italy, to the mountains farms that produce Grana Padano in Trentino, the small plain farm. And with the mountain, small plain, permanent middles with the national average of farms producing milk. In this case, the best results are the ones of the permanent middles farm, because if we consider a product like the milk, what is very important is the feed production and the permanent middles, allowing this case to reduce the impact due to the self-produced feed. And so in this case, the results showed the best performance for this kind of farms. So this is another way in which life cycle assessment can be used into the agri-food sector. Another example is the one in which we tried to apply life cycle assessment approaches into the evaluation of the circular economy systems. Because as you know, to move from a linear system to a circular system is mandatory to be more sustainable. But often the way we find to be circular are more impacting than the normal way in which residues or waste are used like waste. So this is an example developed in which we used Hermet and Lucens to transform fruit and vegetable waste into their biomass, mainly made with fat and protein to transform them into energy. So this is an example of the energy production. So this is an example of the energy production. The energy production is through a pyrolysis plant in which biochar can be obtained. And also the effect of biochar has been tested as a soil amendment and also as an instrument to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Results have been published related to the Emilia-Romagna region into the paper. You can scan the QR code, but I can send you all the references. And really, we tested also another possibility to use the Black soldier fly not only to produce energy, so to transform them into biofuels, but also to use them directly to feed other animals. Also, if now considering the regulations we have in Europe and in Italy, the use of a Black soldier fly fed into the waste is not allowed to produce feed that can be used again to feed other animals. So we tested it is a way without can use it due to the regulations we have. Here you can see the results compared to the normal treatment of waste into the Emilia-Romagna and into the left, into the table and into the right, into the graph. The comparison of the different system we tested because we tested different mix of waste. We tested different mix of waste and also different efficiency due to the different condition in which a Black soldier fly can be used to transform them. The goal was to transform the fat contained into the Black soldier fly into biofuels by doing a transist certification. And as you can see into the right, the best option is using high efficiency. Because we have a lower feed conversion bratsia, so we are able to obtain more larvae using less ingredient. And using a mixed food residues in which not only vegetables but the introduction of other kinds of waste are added to improve the nutritional quality of the substrates provided to the larvae. And in some of the right, this kind of transformation is more sustainable than the production of biofuels from soybeans. So it depends on the indicators we use, but can be an opportunity to transform in some, in some cases that the waste into something that can be used. But we have to be aware that sometimes we are improving the impacts if in comparison to the normal treatment of waste into the Emilia-Romagna. So these are just some examples of how life cycle assessment can help us in solve the problem of sustainability into the agri-food system. So we can use it to obtain the most sustainable way to produce. We can use it into an eco-design approach to design before doing the best way to use something or to produce something. Can be useful and I think it's very useful in designing circular systems. Because always we think that something can be sustainable, but without having the proper instruments to measure the sustainability, we cannot say that the reuse or the recycling is always the most sustainable way to use the residues. So in conclusion, what is the life cycle assessment is a compass needed to address sustainability. Sustainability must be measured and not only declared because we agree we need to be sustainable. We know that at the moment we are completely unsustainable, but to do something, we have to follow the results of some measures to find the proper way to be more sustainable. Life cycle assessment is based into the models. We developed a lot of models for instance about the proper way to measure the impact of pesticides into the environment. And these models must be updated over time, considering the knowledge we are developing into this field. And often the best solution is a compromise between different results because it's very difficult to find a solution that is the best from all the perspective. But different kind of results must be integrated in order to have the best solution for the problem we have. I hope you enjoyed this presentation. Also, it's very basic, but to explore better the opportunity of life cycle assessment. We will need more time. In the case in which you need something more or in the case in which you have some questions, I'm here to answer you. If you have a question, if you have questions or post, I will answer those questions. And in the case in which you would like to write to me, I can provide you my email and we can continue our discussion also by email. So thank you Lucrezia for this very interesting seminar. So now the floor is open for questions. So whoever has questions may raise the hand or write the question in the chat and I will read it. I would like to just show you that the winner is Gianluca. Gianluca. So I don't know if Gianluca is really brilliant, but... I guess no. He's the winner. Okay, thank you. Followed by Maria and Alessandro. My pleasure. Okay, so we have a question in the chat by Valentino. He thanked Lucrezia. He thanked Lucrezia for the presentation. And the question is, what is your opinion on taking account of ecosystem services provided in a process, for instance in agriculture, when assessing LCA? Some scientists have proposed to allocate the whole CO2 equivalent balance of the farm sharing it among main products and co-products as well. It has ecosystem services provided. So fertility could be one of these possible co-products to be taken into account in order to allocate the whole CO2 equivalent balance of a farm. Thank you again. Yes, thank you for the question. Very interesting. As I mentioned before, when we define functional unit, when considering agriculture, there are a lot of functions that agriculture is providing that are not only the production of food. So in the moment in which we shift from the production of food that we can introduce the accounting of all the other services provided by agriculture, like for instance, other ecosystem services. There are a lot that are growing literature into the accounting of ecosystem services using a life cycle assessment. The problem at the moment I'm seeing this is just my opinion is to have a consensus model that can be used in order to obtain standardized results. And moreover, another opportunity I'm seeing for agricultural production to include the benefit of agriculture into a life cycle assessment is to consider the carbon dioxide stock in agriculture, for instance, shifting from a conventional agriculture to the carbon dioxide stock. And moreover, another opportunity I think is to consider the carbon farming, for instance, the carbon farming, instead of other way to make agriculture. So something is changing. But at the moment, I agree to consider all the other services provided by agriculture, like impact that can be positive or negative, must be measured before the carbon dioxide. a positive positive must be measured before confirmed. But the current problem is that we haven't a consensus model. I think we will have because there are a lot of working on this direction and the water policies are going into it. this direction okay sorry valentino could you repeat sorry thanks again thank you again professor lamaster for your explanations sorry for my technical difficulties on the internet connection so i'm not able to probably the um probably my my comments i i gave right now uh where um didn't didn't didn't reach the the um the platform again thank you for the full explanation that are was all the all the points that you uh mentioned are very interesting insights in in view of uh considering further options and uh uh promoting the the the role of agriculture in in the in the environment conservation thank you again thank you thank you to valentino now there's a question uh by eribert in some eribert uh yes thank you for this very interesting talk um i have a question concerning the different cattle raising systems that you have that you have shown and it's a bit contradicting to that what i am teaching or i used to teach to my students that the cattle raising uh with concentrated feed maybe from from soybean uh evolves less carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases because um because of the microbiota in the rumen um so the the rumen microbiota seems to be more targeted towards producing methane if um if hay or uh or grass is used as a as a feedstock then when concentrated food uh feed is being used uh actually i'm basing this on a on a study made in italy i don't recall who the authors were but that was uh quite uh quite uh nicely showing the big difference in uh in methane emissions uh by the rumen microbiota okay so in this case we consider the food life cycle uh mainly we can say that the con the carbon footprint of one liter of milk is divided into three main um process contributing to the emissions that are the enteric fermentation the feed supply the feed production and supply the manure management in this case we estimated the methane emissions considering the guidelines of the ipcc and considering of course the nutritional the nutritional content of the different feed we analyzed them so we used a tier three approach in which we have specific information about the different feed the one obtained from the product from the product from the product from the product from the product and we have probably an increase into the enteric fermentation but what is reducing into this case is the production of feed so if you i share again the screen just to explain better um what i'm trying to explain um the differences are very very little so here you can see uh the national near feeds for national italian representative farms while into the right you have a permanent middles farm as you can see weighted and normalized the results are very similar for one liter of milk what is different if you calculate the percentage probably is the amount of self-produced feed that contribute considering that permanent middles doesn't permanent middles don't require a lot of work to be cropped require less input so in this case the permanent middles farm um contributes as the same as the national italian representative farms in which insulate are used and here the advantage is not in the phase of the enteric fermentation but in the phase in which we are producing feed okay moreover you have to consider that this kind of farms into the mantua district are very particular because um are we selected 70 farms to make this study but they have a very high efficiency also if reducing the nutritional value of the feed provided so it's a very particular case in italy because as you can see for instance mountain farms that use the same kind of feed the same nutrition have higher impacts so mf and pmf have the same kind of nutrition showing different results so it's a particularity of this kind of permanent middles farm into the mantra district that are able to combine high efficiency while using uh grassland grass products mortgages uh and the advantage is the reduction of the input due to the uh self-production feed them and the lighting reduction into okay yeah this correspondence corresponds quite well with with that what i thought yeah uh okay thank you you're welcome thank you thank you now it's time for the question of rebecca hi thank you very much for your interesting talk for me were many new concepts and my question may be um i'm going to be silly but i have to do it since i work a long time with cyanobacteria which is photosynthetic organisms so um you present some um okay how the co2 bio is biological to reduce it for organisms and then um fix it by photosynthetic organisms entering the cycle which understood but then you showed that is um that um co2 produced by um biofuels or for the industry is not taken by by the photosynthetic organisms so i was wondering um from from the ignorance why if this co2 is maybe related with other um with other um i don't know um composting in in the atmosphere or they are not available as co2 in the atmosphere or why the the photosynthetic organisms will not take that co2 since i just feel my culture speak co2 in organic co2 and then they are capable to to fix this co2 do you know that's not my question maybe this is a question sorry no no no no if uh you can uh uh help me to explain better for instance that uh biogenic carbon dioxide is not taken into account into the assessment in general but for instance methane biogenic methane is taken into account biogenic carbon dioxide and not okay this is a basic into the life cycle assessment and i presented you a consideration just to explain you to consider one phase is not enough because in them for instance the emissions during the combustion of biofuel but can be also wood for instance are not considered the emissions of carbon dioxide because they are considered biogenic and the amount emitted is considered equivalent to the amount that has been stored before into the plant structures used to produce the biofuels or wood for instance i think you that we have a lot of other way to uh store and to use carbon dioxide at the moment not considering into life cycle assessment for instance i would like to do a work in which we are able to estimate them because it's another opportunity to completely understand the impact of agriculture without considering just the emissions we already know but some benefits from which we have to know something more that uh probably we know into the field but outside when someone else doing life cycle assessment that is it doesn't know how agriculture works probably have not has not an idea of this kind of effect so like the first question so we have to do something more to uh develop life cycle assessment related to agriculture considering not only the carbon dioxide emission biogenics it is very easy to be understood and to be explained but also some other opportunity agriculture has to store carbon dioxide but also to provide other kind of services that can be very useful from an environmental point of view okay thank you Victoria it's your turn oh thank you thank you i uh thank you lucrezia i mean for me it was i learned a lot and i like and i think for many scientists like me who are very let's say fixed in one topic and genetics or some specific mechanism to listen to this kind of to the to your talk is is very important so my question is very general i mean i just like to have your feedback on what is the state and what is your belief of this i mean i read i'm not an expert but i read about carbon capture by the soil so the soil as we know today is the most biodiverse um biodiverse i don't know a niche or place on the planet uh there's more microbes in on the earth than anything and it's where everything starts and also the earth is we know it's so important for the one health concept uh human health starts from the soil so and i read about carbon capture from the soil uh the microbes can using carbonic anidases can fix co2 or i don't know what is your belief of this is this uh uh too optimistic or is this realistic that in the future scientists can develop mechanism to fix co2 uh and and bring it to to the then this can then be provided uh you know cementized or or provided to plants or or or whatever i really like to to have your feedback thanks thank you no i hope that uh our idea that is your idea is not too optimistic that so in the future we can have a uh this uh opportunity to uh have a model a consensus model to assess the key the this kind of benefit um to the future so uh what i what i think is that at the moment the soil is completely underestimated into the life cycle assessment approach because if you check all the most used 15 indicators about soil that is just land user okay so a measure of the land used to produce something without any specific stub indicators to um consider the quality of the soil of the soil and so okay it is important to uh reduce the use of soil but we have also to the screen to separate different uses of soils because there are some uses that are real soil consumption and some others in which soil is is can be improved and can provide a lot of services so for instance from the life cycle assessment approaches to footprints have been very commonly considered like a carbon footprint and the water footprint but no one about the quality of soil so also if soil is fundamental uh for agriculture for biodiversity for a lot of services at the moment is completely uh underestimated into the life cycle assessment approach i think that now we are moving to the carbon farming approach is something is changing and i hope that in the future more important will be will be given to the soil i think that now soil is underestimated also because this kind of approach the life cycle assessment uh born into the industry sector so and after this has been translated into the agricultural sector and so at the moment we are adopting something that is born for other purposes and now is the moment to develop a proper way to assess this kind of benefit or something like benefit also using this approach thank you thank you okay okay any more questions for lucrezia from the audience no so i think we can thank lucrezia for this interesting event thank you thank you to everyone for participating um my slides can be shared with all the present and as my contacts too so if you would like to go further into this discussion i will be available to discuss further with you thank you thank you and congratulations very nice uh presentation very clear you're a very good speaker thank you thank you thank you thank you okay so thank you again lucrezia and just uh before let's say closing the event i want to remind you again the next appointment of our webinar uh which is on the 6th of uh february with uh the topic of biostimulant so thank you again for joining and for the discussion thank you bye bye my uh
