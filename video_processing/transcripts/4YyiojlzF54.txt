 Thanks very much. So today what I want to do is try to talk about mob grazing and I guess mob grazing has probably been around for maybe 10 years and when you talk to people about what is it, no one can give you a real definition and there was an extension agent in Nebraska, Terry Gompert, who did a study, a survey of producers and basically tried to get some information about what that is and basically there's probably it's a high stocking density from maybe 20 to 25,000 pounds of live weight of animals to maybe somewhere up towards a million pounds and so people are moving livestock perhaps once a day to several times a day when you start moving to higher stock densities and with that one of the targets could be you know high trampling and high consumption of forage and another component to this of course is there's more labor that's involved and so there's really no you cannot no one's made a definition of what it is there are people that said it's a high stock density or it's an ultra high stock density and and perhaps people throw out things like well yeah you know 25,000 pounds of live weight per acre is really kind of a souped up managed intensive grazing and so really you've got to be up towards that 200,000 300,000 things like that but when there's really no standard definition and no um no no group has come up with that definition so basically i just kind of showcase it as is really shared characteristics usually when you're talking to to people about mob grazing or you're listening to gurus talk about mob grazing they're really talking about probably two things and one is what they call a landscaping where you're trying to improve the probably the soil health and the vegetation of that land so the idea is kind of of reclamation so there may be land that had been beat up in the past and you're really looking at trying to use the livestock in an intensive way to try to to get more of that uh litter and that biomass above ground biomass and and try to trample it with livestock and get it in contact with that soil surface so you can let all that soil biota uh do its work and try to to add organic matter to that to that soil surface and and it also in that process we're hearing people are are making improvements um with that livestock action uh adding diversity uh to their systems another aspect about what's happening with as you increase that stocking density uh what we're finding is that we're actually getting increased harvest efficiency so um that translates to a higher carrying capacity so what i mean about um harvest efficiency is that it's that percentage of the forage that's produced how much of that goes down the throat of the animal so in range systems rangeland people we talk about utilization and utilization is actually the disappearance of that vegetation not that has part to do with consumption but it's also disappearance that's lost um through a maybe destructive forces such as trampling and consumption by wildlife and insects and those kind of things and the natural weathering process and so we've in in um more semi-arid arid systems where perhaps um people have been using more season-long continuous grazing when you have very large pastures we've talked about concepts of take half leave half so that we're aiming for a 50 percent utilization and that means uh we're leaving 50 percent of that biomass for plant vigor for that plant community to sustain itself and so what's actually happening if we leave 50 percent and take 50 percent really only half of that half that we're taking is actually going down the throat so in our very um conventional systems under season-long continuous grazing moderate stocking we're only getting about 25 percent harvest efficiency so when you have that assumption and you make your calculations uh we can set that stocking rate and so um societies like the society for range management that works with ranchers and and range professionals we've developed these kind of safety valves where we know in our in in the way in the rangeland ecology that we can sustain that range land uh with a season-long continuous grazing model or system with taking a 25 percent harvest efficiency results in actually 50 utilization and because we were having some of that forage that's disappearing by insects and wildlife and then we're we're maintaining that um that plant community integrity with a 50 percent utilization and so what we're finding is actually that mob grazing is kind of ignoring this take half leave half rule and just blowing past that and we're getting much higher um efficiencies of harvest and so i'm going to show that uh we're actually getting somewhere towards 35 maybe 40 50 60 percent harvest efficiency and and that is not in a season-long continuous system so i'll have to bring together these concepts of of use and then rest periods that happens with the mob grazing so this study uh was funded through a research and education sare grant and we had um several producers that were contacted and were interested in in developing this these producers were already doing mob grazing and what what i wanted to do was to kind of come alongside them and say you know we're not going to ask you to do anything different than you're doing what we'd like to do is actually document what you're doing so that we can share that with with the public and kind of understand um you know what is mob grazing for some people in south dakota and actually this also had some other additional funding with it with a with a an nrcs cig grant where we we partnered with some with some people in nebraska so there's actually five other locations in nebraska where that were kind of following similar similar protocols so you can see we've got a nice uh gradient across the state of south dakota on the east side across the west and we had a few partners up in the in the north and kind of in this region close to aberdeen and if you go if you look across south dakota on the on the i-29 quarter on the eastern part of south dakota we're probably 23 inch rainfall and you get out towards rapid city and then we're around 15 to 17. so in the middle of the state they're probably around between 17 and 20 and further out so we've got a nice uh understanding of that rainfall and how that looks in terms of the vegetation and we're going to see that people are adapting to that and they're doing things differently because of that so this is a stocking density kind of characterizing what people are doing in terms of the um thousands of pounds of beef per acre so we've got a couple of these sites um the new wonderwood site and the queen site are out west queen is by wall south dakota and the new wonderwood is just by rapid city and so you can see their stocking densities are somewhere around 20 to 25 000 and as you uh move towards the east then we're but are typically what we're finding is they're somewhere around 50 000 pounds uh per acre is our stocking density and in 2012 there was a a quite a severe drought and so that definitely dropped the stocking rate the one outlier is actually reliance and that's actually showing on this graph at 300 000 he was actually at a million and he was doing that just for fun to try to demonstrate what that would look like so i think he was moving somewhere to 12 or 15 times a day to be able to achieve that so the he had i want to i think it was somewhere in the out of 300 pair that were on a piece of ground for 45 minutes and he had set up ahead of time some bat latches so that they were going off on timers and so the cattle were actually moving themselves and so and i want and then we had a comparison there was a rotation that uh that was just moving once a day or twice a day at 50 000 so on so he kind of has this really extreme so it's kind of fun to fun to look at all right there's a lot of information in this particular slide so i've got to take you through it to kind of draw out some really important things here so first of all what we did is we went and picked four locations with a graduate student where we did some pretty intensive of clipping of vegetation so we would take a quarter meter square and run several transects and we would clip all that vegetation uh prior to to the cattle turning out onto these areas and then we would we would get the staining biomass and we'd get the litter the old litter that was on the ground and then after the cattle were into that spot and they moved on to another spot we'd come back and locate those same transects and then we put down another quarter meter square paired that up with the previous one and then we collected and separated stuff that was newly trampled the old litter and the stuff that was left standing so what we could do by subtraction is kind of get an estimate of disappearance by of consumption and how much is newly trampled and those kind of things so the first part that you see the the the darker green is basically the the standing biomass of the vegetation before the cattle were put into it then the the gray bar is the post vegetation and the the lighter green in the middle this is the pre-litter that was already existing and then this is the post the post litter and so some of that and theoretically should be the same if the cattle aren't eating litter which you wouldn't expect so there's going to be a little sampling here or there but one of the things that i want to draw your attention to is this last bar which would be the trampling so that's that new litter and so what i want to show is is uh if you make the subtraction so you're starting with your pre-biomass and then with your end biomass if you if you pull out how much was trampled then you can get how much was consumed by livestock and so what i've put down here is the harvest efficiency so these numbers are the percent of that was down the throat of the existing the pre-biomass vegetation so you can see that there's a a wide variety but you but it's more than our typical um if we planned a season-long continuous grazing at moderate levels that's at base 25 percent so why why these producers are doing this is because they're getting uh with this intensive stocking densities up to that 25 to 50 000 to 200 or maybe a million is is they're getting higher harvest efficiencies so to put this in perspective if you think about in western south dakota with our our stocking rates are about a half a um per acre and that translates to probably a stocking density for a six-month grazing season that's less than 500 pounds of live weight per acre and if you come over to the east side of the state where we have stocking rates somewhere maybe one and a half to maybe two a ums per acre at a traditional rotation you might be at five you know moving cattle once a week we might be at five thousand pounds per acre of live weight and so what we're seeing is even though when we go up to 25 000 pounds that doesn't seem like a lot but it's you know it's probably five times more intensive than our our typical rotations that we used to be doing you know when we're starting to move livestock once a day and so one of our producers that that's by haytie you know he was moving um cattle twice a day and his stocking densities were closer to that 200 000 the chamberlain was around 50 000 pounds per acre so part of it is going to be the vegetation so what we've been finding is that in as the vegetation is shorter and in a vegetative state they tend not to trample as much because it's sparser than and what they're doing is they're consuming more and it's actually hard to get uh newly trampled so out at this quin site you know we're we've we've got about uh maybe um 20 percent of that is getting trampled and and and interestingly enough at the at the chamberlain site you know they're not trampling that much but at haytie um they were getting a little bit more trampled and the haytie site uh a little was about or about the same as productivity of the chamberlain but it has to do with you know if that vegetation gets taller you know they're more apt to probably knock some of that down so from the late there's a remember the two goals that why people are probably doing this there's a landscaping goal where you really want to trample that vegetation to try to build soil health you know get more land covered and then there's kind of maybe a stocking uh carrying capacity stocking rate uh you know a harvest efficiency goal where you're trying to get more consumption and maintaining animal performance and so in that same net standpoint then what we're probably meeting you know that those goals from that that increased harvest efficiency so this is where the economics play in that uh you're spending your time you know most of the producers probably spend about a half an hour maybe an hour at most to move the livestock a day and it's it's paying off in terms of they're able to you know increase that stocking density um and getting that higher harvest efficiency and so what we're finding is that how how do they do that if these harvest efficiencies and these utilization rates remember utilization is basically the consumption plus trampling and so those are pretty high notice if you just calculate utilization that would be your pre-vegetation minus the post vegetation and that difference is really high so a lot of times we're getting 80 utilization and of that 80 percent maybe 40 or so of it is is down the throat the other 40 may be trampled or you know there's some proportion of those and so from a as a trained person in the range science that is uh stressful because we're thinking oh we're blowing past take half leave half and and that can't be good for the plant community is that actually a sustainable practice so had to wrestle with with these concepts so so here's what's happening you graze a a piece of land for one day or for half a day and you're not coming back to it for a whole year so they're getting a long rest period you got a very intensive you know utilization very high but a lot of rest so what i like to do to translate what this means to me is let's for example let's say you you're harvesting a hay field well we harvest hay pretty much every at the same time every year so let's say you have a hay field it's july 1st you come in with your sycabar mower and you cut it down at you know a few inches off the ground you're probably getting 80 90 percent harvest efficiency and we do that for 50 100 years whatever and it comes back and you get the same productivity every single year obviously there's fluctuations based on you know rainfall but that's a sustainable practice because it's always producing about the same amount so if we switch to these higher stocking density kind of systems where we're only on that piece of ground for half a day or for a day essentially we're kind of taking that same concept and and applying it to livestock so the livestock are the mower yeah they're not getting 80 or 90 percent of it they're maybe getting 40 and knocking down 40 or they're getting 60 and knocking down 20 but you get the point that because we have such long rest periods up to a year it does not hurt the vegetation now we know that um it's some of the rest periods some of that time period you know is going to be dormant season so when we talk about resting for an entire year there are times when you can rest land in the winter it does really no good it's going to be key on what's the growth rate of these plants afterwards so if you graze these things in a stage where they're the grass is in a boot stage and you hit it hard every year you're probably going to set it back because plants are most vulnerable in the boot stage if you wait till the plants are headed out and graze it that time of year you're probably not going to hurt the plants because when plants have headed out they've put down most of what they need from the root structure so when i think about a simplistic way of grazing and what kind of impact am i going to have below ground is just think about when the plant is tall it's probably tall below ground when the plant is short it's probably short below ground so depending upon when you graze that's kind of reflective of the impact that you're going to have below ground so when we graze when the plant is tall we're not going to hurt it because it's probably set a lot of you know root structure on a side note i had a grad student that at our vulga site which was near brookings to kind of play around with different stocking densities so we had our producers where we we let them do what they wanted to do and and and the kind of vary between 25 up to maybe 200 000 pounds stocking rate and so what we wanted to do was look at stocking rates from from 50 000 pounds up to 800 000 pounds so what we did is we just we would put the enough for one day or two days or we would go towards you know moving maybe um eight times a day or ten times a day those kind of things and so we buried that and then we did the same thing we went ahead into the paddock before they came and clipped the samples separated into those standing vegetation litter and then we allowed the animals to graze those paddocks and then we pulled them off and then we went back to those same areas and put down a sample next to this area that we clipped before and then we had the new trampled we had the old litter and we had the standing vegetation so what i'm showing you is the the utilization so the remember the utilization is what was um is the pre-vegetation and you subtract off the post so utilization is consumption plus trampling and in to in 2012 we had that we had that drought and so we had uh some issues of course um didn't want to hurt the grass and and didn't have as much forage uh and then in 2013 it was a little bit uh wetter and so what you see is kind of is that um what are we achieving you know how much are the cattle eating and knocking things down and what it kind of appears that is that how much it's what stocking density is enough it are is a 50 000 pound stock density enough to to achieve some of these things do you need a hundred do you need 200 you need 400 800 because we have producers um throughout north america that are going from anywhere from that 25 to 50 that maybe are going up to like dennis um uh neil dennis up in canada that may be up towards a million and so is there kind of this law diminishing returns is like how much is enough and so what we found is that you know in that that there's a you know an increase in utilization then it kind of levels off and the same kind of thing here is that there's there's only so much you can do and so what we're finding out is that you know yeah maybe um you know at 50 000 pounds depending upon the the vegetation we where we're at you know maybe 200 000 pounds is enough and that and that may be moving twice a day in in higher rainfall environments but 200 000 pounds of stocking weight or live weight in western environments with less vegetation you have to move several times a day so and then part of the other thing was just to kind of compare this to two folks that are doing mob grazing so at some of the sites they had a comparison that we could do with mob grazing and here this is just ocular estimates of of the grass cover so it wasn't the it wasn't clipping the vegetation but we would make these ocular estimates of before and after and and so what i'm showing you again is the is the before you would go into the paddock and then the after and then you can make those subtractions to get at that utilization and and kind of consumption things and so what we're showing here is that yeah they're getting more they're getting more utilization compared to the rotation with the mob grazing same thing so when you just look at mob versus rotation so so the bottom line is you know again just reiterating why are people wanting to do this why are they intensifying this uh rotational grazing with this mob grazing and it really comes comes down to it is that um they're gaining a higher harvest efficiency there's that uh higher we're getting higher utilization but it's a safe practice because we're only on that that piece of land for just one day and it gets to be rested the other parts of the year so here are some just some pictures of before and after um so this is uh a 57 000 pounds stock density just you know moving once a day so that's what it looks like another graduate student looked at some some of the the weeds and so we looked at uh western snowberry which is a native shrub and we also looked at some of the um the the thistles and as you increase that stocking density cattle then tend to to to utilize some of those broadleaf plants that they normally wouldn't do so that's part of it as well this is the one that was at uh uh reliance uh a sandy soil where he um grazed at that million pounds they're only on that on a piece of land for um i think it was a third of an acre 45 minutes with a 300 pair and so they really trampled it and really high distribution of of um of dung and then the there's where the the rotation for 12 hours on 55 000 so you get a much higher utilization so here's new percent new litter cover this is again an ocular the the one that was um quinn and the um the new underwood sites are really far west and so only five percent maybe ten percent new litter these are areas that were receiving 15 inches of rainfall and it's just darn hard to get new litter i mean when you're there there's a lot of space in between plants so can mob grazing be used for landscaping in semi-arid arid environments it's very challenging because there's not a lot of biomass to begin with and to and to in order to maintain performance there's not much to trample and this is dung uh density so we we looked at paths per meter square and so that's one of the things is that we're increasing utilization and getting more evenly distribution of density of the excrement we had a couple tours for the researchers on the project in 20 in 2012 and 2013 and we also made some videos um if you want to just go to the south dakota grassland coalition sdgrass.org you can find these videos you can search you can google them or go onto youtube and you'll find them uh pat guptill is the one by quinn uh charlie totten's by chamberlain and then rick smith is by watertown and those are available to look at so bottom line is producers are getting a higher harvest efficiency we've also taken soil samples to document carbon but we haven't got all our soil samples analyzed and so we're we're still waiting for those but what i would say is that i don't expect soil carbon to probably increase that's a slow process especially you think about those western environments where there's not a lot of new litter being added it's that's not the mechanism for it to happen when you're only getting five percent new litter on the ground it much makes a lot more sense that you probably can increase soil carbon as you move further east where there's a lot of biomass and you can get it trampled on the ground does that make sense so my guess is that we're going to see these benefits um return to us from the higher harvest efficiency to pay for the labor and make make these ranches more sustainable and these guys are only doing it for maybe 60 days um it's not sustainable to kill yourself working that hard either and so there's there's reason you know a time period which which they're doing for so what we're going to we're expecting a graduate student in the econ department to finish up his thesis here this semester and then we're going to be able to put that uh economic analysis that he'll do uh um when we write our final report so the question is how many how big are the paddocks so they'll rain they're typically uh five acres uh of what uh and then it's just depending upon how many pair so the one by uh chamberlain he would give four to five acres and he'd have 250 pair um the one producer that's since uh by selby he's actually here today uh he's i think he's around four or five acres and that same kind of thing so they're at that 50 000 pound stocking density so the question was did the did the producers increase their overall stocking rate for the year and i would say for yes for that piece of ground they are increasing their stocking rate their carrying capacity so these typically are our older crop our cropland long time ago been planted back to to introduce species and they're purposely getting more bang for the buck on that spot there are some the one in reliance it was native or not reliance the one by uh chamberlain was native and we think with uh with the system that he's doing he's probably a two and a half times higher than the typical nrcs recommended take half leave half for season long so we are getting higher stocking rates for those pieces of land and it was mostly um not virgin native most of them are these old cropland that was in the west it's crested like monospecies yep crested wheat crested wheat grass alfalfa out west intermediate wheat wheat grass um brome grass kind of things kentucky bluegrass and the central the one in haytai by watertown rick smith it's a a planted back uh blue stem big blue stem kind of thing and and so what they're doing is they're intensifying on land that can handle that but remember it's getting rested for essentially a year and then how do the animals perform like how so they're watching body condition we didn't have weights and most people don't take the weights but you can tell the producers that they're doing this for 30 days or 60 days and then they kind of go back to a rotation where they're getting moved you know once a month once a week twice a week kind of thing so they can cows can compensate there's compensatory gain so even if they're challenged a little bit for 30 days or 60 days you'll find that they will make that up in a later period it's mostly yep everybody that we're working with our cow calf pairs except pat guptill that he's got um bred heifers and i should mention gary that's um cliff mill saps over by gary he's got steers so he's around 17 000 pounds stock density and he's actually moving through maybe two to three times a year so he wants to make sure he has good animal performance to put gain on steers so there's two people that have yearlings every else's cow calf pair giraffe man on the ground so
