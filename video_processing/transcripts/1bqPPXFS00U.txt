Howto & Style
 Friends, welcome back to Bloomer Home and Garden and today we are talking once again about the garden. Today we're talking about soil testing. So you can see our garden is all tilled up. The soil is really soft and fluffy and it's ready to plant. Or is it? There are a couple important steps before we start thinking about actually putting our plants in the soil. Just by looking at the soil we can't tell what's in here and if it will be beneficial for the plants that we want to plant. That is why soil testing is so important. Just like we need nutrients and vitamins and carbohydrates to be strong and healthy, our plants need certain vitamins and minerals as well that are typically found in the soil. However, this garden has been planted several times and the plants that were here before took out certain nutrients and I need to know what is existing in this soil before I put new plants in. So soil testing measures those important minerals and substances that are nutrients for our plants that our plants need to grow and thrive and eventually produce the produce that we're looking for in our garden. Some plants do not like soil that is high in acid. Most vegetables do not. So if our pH is not correct, our plants are not going to thrive. So soil testing is kind of like a little money in the bank, a little assurance to tell us what is going to happen to our plants once they go in the soil. Part two of that is amending the soil before the plants go in. Now once we test our soil and we get the results and we know what's in here and what is lacking, then we can add those things that are needed. That is called amending or fixing and making the soil proper for the plants that we want to put in here. Now there are several tests that you can do to test your soil. They can be as simple as a one test just to test the pH. You can go deeper with nitrogen and potash and several others. Another thing that you can do is take some soil samples and send them into your Cooperative Extension Office or other agricultural lab. That also has a fee but they give you a complex rundown of exactly what's in your soil. That also takes some time. So for me the best way to test my soil is by using an at-home test. Now the one that I have selected is easy to get from Amazon and I will link it down below. Let me show you what that test is like. I am using this Luster Leaf Rapid Soil Test Kit. It measures its pH, potash, phosphorus, and the nitrogen content. It's a very simple test. We're just going to collect some soil and then we're going to add some water into each of these tubes and add a little powder from the capsules and it will show up in these ranges and show us where we are on the scale from too much to not enough. Help us decide what we need to add or subtract from our soil. So to gather the soil for our soil test we're going to want to go down a few inches. We're going to want to get the soil where the roots of our plants are going to be once they're established. That's where they're going to be sucking up the nutrients. We really don't want to get anything on the top of the soil because nothing really grows on the top. We also want to get our samples from several different areas in the garden so we have an overall view not just one spot. We're going to need the soil we collected. A couple of quart jars. Now I'm doing three separate tests. I'm going to do the test of what the soil is made of. I'm going to test our garden soil. So I'm doing three separate tests. I'm going to do the test of what the soil is made of. I'm going to test our garden soil and I'm also going to test the compost that I want to add into the soil later. So I'm going to do three tests but for each test you only need one jar. You are going to need right where지�les I'm going to see the water cover. You are going to need a water meeting covering the vegetable can only be in the water which I'm using and I'm going to take a couple of parts of my water cream measuring devices as well and I'm just using this purified drinking water you want to be sure that the water is purified and not well water because that's going to alter your testing so purified water I have some notes here labels that I'm going to use and then of course I have something to jot down my test results of course you're going to need your soil test kit now that I have my half cup in my nutrient testing jars I'm using a totally different jar for the soil test it even has a smaller ring around the top so I can tell it apart should my label get knocked off or something I want to be able to tell that it's distinctly different because this is the soil type test not the soil nutrient test we're adding in our two and a half cups of distilled water for our nutrient test testing test and now for the soil type testing the soil was halfway up the jar and then we add water until it's three quarters full so the entire content brings the jar to three quarters full so it's not three quarter cups of water it will depend on your soil if your soil is heavy or if your soil is light how much water you're going to add here but you're just going to add until the jar is three quarters full and don't forget to add your teaspoon of liquid dish detergent to your soil type test jar only not the nutrient jar just the soil test give everything a good shake you really want to mix it up get everything stirred in really really well this is going to help us get the best results so give it a good shake and then you want to set it down and not disturb it again once you have your jars filled you want to place them back away where they're not going to get disturbed again and i realized that i also wanted to test for the raised bed garden and i didn't do that so i'm going to go ahead and get that one ready and i will meet you back in the next video in 24 hours but first we're going to go over our little test kit and i want to share just what's in it and to let you know that i will be sharing the review after using this product this is the first time i have used this product so we're opening up and the first thing i like is that is it that's just how easy you just pull that back card so i like it this card you want to hang on to it looks like just a piece of cardboard but inside they have given you all kinds of valuable information information on what the tests are how to test what's beneficial and all those things that you can do the success of using the test and they also give you all the information about determining what to do after your test results so i thought that was a load of great information especially if you're just starting out or you need a refresher this comes with an eye dropper this comes with an eye dropper of course the capsules you see me unpack and it comes with the four testing vials and it comes with the four testing vials and the phone and the phone is coming out of the phone as you can do this for the test success of using the test and they also give you all the information about determining what to do after your test results so i thought that was a load of great information especially if you're just starting out or you need a refresher this comes with an eyedropper of course the capsules you see me unpack and it comes with the four testing vials and these were a good quality plastic and they were large print easy to read so this was a plus for me also by the way guys zero sponsorship for this review this was just one i picked up off of amazon i want to try it but if i'm going to try it i want to give you the information too so i like that the capsules are color-coded and you cannot mix up which one goes in which container the fronts are easy to read and of course the lid is color coded to the little plastic information on the front the range and the capsules are color-coded to that and you get lots of capsules so that you can repeat the tests more than once so that is all a plus love that as you can see everything is clear and organized and easy to use they also send you this little piece of paper that has a ton of information so for flowers plants shrubs trees everything that you can think of they have it categorized and the ph level that they are most healthy at and there's also an order form to order more supplies so this is not a one and done test guys this morning everything has set overnight and we have some interesting findings let's look and see what kind of soil we have and i'm really nervous about the outcomes i really want to know what is in the soil so it'd be interesting to know what i'm going to need to do to make my soil ready for that well here is my soil type jar and as you can see it did separate and what does that separation mean what kind of soil makeup do i have what are the things combined that makes my soil what it is we're going to take a look now according to the science behind this project sand which is the heaviest of all particles is going to fall to the bottom the middle layer which is very hard to see but it's right here it's about a quarter of an inch thick that would be the layer of silt clay will be the top layer and if you're lucky you'll have a lot of organic matter up here and that's good thing that is very good to have a lot of organic matter the combination that we're looking for is 40 percent sand 40 percent silt and 20 percent clay as we examine my garden makeup you can see my layer of sand is a high percentage my layer of silt is not and then we have this layer of clay which is probably more than the 20 percent we want it to be so obviously my makeup is not that perfect 40 40 20 recipe that we are looking for and i know that's true because we live in an area where the soil is very sandy and sandy soil drains very rapidly it's a blessing and a curse water does not stand nor does it last for any length of time and what happens is as that clay dries out it forms a crust and then the top of my soil is very hard it often cracks open and you know the recipe for making bricks is sand and clay and to bake it in the hot heat so that's what i get and i know we can make this better i have some organic material we can add more organic material into this by taking the things that i've added to the raised bed and that compost and adding it into my big garden soil i believe that we can certainly make this and get closer to that perfect 40 40 20 recipe here we have our three jars and this is our raised bed soil this is our regular garden soil and this is the compost that i had delivered that i would like to add to this now i think adding this to this because we just looked at that garden makeup it's really going to help that middle layer that i'm lacking in now these i didn't separate because i didn't do that kind of a test i didn't add the soap and i didn't shake them um other than just to mix them so we don't know the makeup of how much sand and loam and everything well we do this one because we that's the one we actually measured but for the raised bed and the compost i really didn't feel that that was important the raised bed is all added soil so i have bagged soils that i've purchased and then last year i added a lot of this and this year i filled my beds with this and i mixed it really well so that's why these two look alike because there is a lot of this in this and you can see though that there are other things in here because while this is real watery at the top this does have more heavy materials in it so let's get into the nutrition content and see what we have now i'm going to start with the large garden soil first and we're going to do the ph test first the ph test is done a little differently we're just going to put soil in the container just to that little line and i don't know if you can see them then there's another little fill line with water and we're going to put in the tablet and it will tell us on the scale where our ph is for the large garden soil now there is a sweet spot it is right in here and that is where our vegetables like to be so hopefully our ph is at that level let's take a minute to talk about ph and why we test it what is ph ph is a measurement of the acidity or the alkalinity of something in this case we're talking about our soil it is measured on a scale of 0 to 14 and 7 is neutral as the numbers go down from 7 it is more acid and if it goes up it is more alkaline and like i said there is that sweet spot about six five point five six point five somewhere in there now there are acid loving plants and fruits and there are some who like it more alkaline but for our purposes we want it kind of right there in the middle soil ph also influences soil dwelling microorganisms and organisms like earthworms that provide benefits for our plants and help our plants take up other nutrition and you can see here that just in the few seconds that we're testing we're kind of right in that slight acid 6.5 perfect spot now we're going to move on and do our garden soil nutrient testing and we're going to test for the important nutrients found in the soil or should be found in the soil and we're just going to use the water that we've already mixed up yesterday and allowed to sit overnight and we're actually going to test all three soils but right now we're going to start with the large garden soil and we're going to do our nitrogen our potash and our phosphorus and i'm just going to talk about why we do the test you can see how i'm doing the test so if you have questions go ahead and put them in the comment section but we're just going to get in and talk about the importance of these tests now nitrogen is needed in the greatest amounts it's what feeds our plants it is the first number on all fertilizers both organic and synthetic not only is it the most needed it's the most readily lost from the soil as our plants are planted they're taking up those vitamins and nutrients and they're using it up so it gets used up easily and it's vital it's the natural part in chlorophyll manufacturer through photosynthesis it stimulates leafy green growth and promotes that healthy plant and encourages seed and fruit development or produce as you know tomatoes and peppers and all those things so you can tell when you're deficient because you have overall leaf yellowing and very weak plants and if your plants are weak it limits the ability for them to take up phosphorus which is another important important part moving on to pot ash or potassium they call it potassium or potash because back in the day they extracted it by putting ashes in a pot and squeezing them down and getting the nutrients out potassium or potash is one of those essential nutrients for all plant and animal life it synthesizes plant sugars and it helps it uptake food it protects the plants against stream temperatures fights stress fights diseases protects against wilting strengthens those roots and the stems it helps them use water efficiently so without it magnesium stagnant or would cease to grow and it would be a crucial balance in the alkaline soils so very important that we keep up with our potassium phosphorus is another important element it's also included it's that second number in all fertilizers and it helps plants uptake those other nutrients building strong roots and it's easy to see your deficiencies because your deficiencies because your plants are small they may not produce any flowers and because most things are grown for their blossoms their blooms their flowers their produce it's very important to replace that phosphorus okay our time is up and our tests have settled it is now time to determine the makeup in our plants and we have the color along the left side it's going to match with the ones along the right and wherever that color is that looks the most like the one on the other side that is it so it looks like our acid is just about perfect and our pot ash is in the sufficient range it looks like we have plenty of phosphorus in this garden so it looks like we have a lot of good nutrition going on now it's really important to document your findings because you think you might remember but you won't and i'm doing three different tests here so i want to be sure to document them so i can come back later and know exactly what i need to do i really like how well this kit cleans up because we're going to do another test we're going to go ahead and wash everything and get it ready for the next test these little plastic id cards that are on the front come right out they're plastic so they're not going to get ruined when you wash it when you're ready to dry it just to make sure that it is really dry on the inside you don't want any other residue go ahead and use a q-tip now we're going to move on and we're going to test the soil from the compost and just see what kind of nutrients are in the compost that i've already added to the raised beds and that i want to add to the big garden we're going to go ahead and start with our ph and again with the ph test you add a little bit of soil in the bottom your distilled water and you give it a good shake of course you add your little green tablet in there and that's going to tell you your overall composure if you have a swimming pool you probably do these very similar tests to test your ph and other things that are in your swimming pool so you may be used to these kind of tests or you may use them for something else next we're going to test our acidity in the soil and again we want that sweet spot right around 6.5 and we're going to do the pot ash as well and you can increase the pot ash in your soil by adding wood ashes to your fire now you want good wood ashes here you don't want to use treated lumber or anything that you've burnt like that but if you have a fire pit at home and you burn and have fires or you have a fireplace or a wood burning stove emptying your ashes in your garden is a great way to improve that overall potash and then till them in in the spring so next we're testing our phosphorus we're going to give that a quick shake and we're going to wait our 10 minutes and see what our results are well it looks like we have a lot of alkaline in the soil but it's not too acid so i think it's going to be okay there is plenty of nitrogen now remember this is a compost so it's going to be higher in nitrogen and good fertilizer so that is a plus now the pot ash here looks like we're kind of a little below adequate and the phosphorus is the same it's kind of between adequate and sufficient so this is the makeup of the compost and adding that to the test results that we've already gotten in the big garden i think i can safely add this without having to make any adjustments to anything i think we're totally fine to add these and it will affect our outcome adding a little more nitrogen will be fine and um yeah i think it's going to be great to add to the big garden now another wash and now we're going to test the raised bed now i'm really excited to get the results of the raised bed because like i said i've controlled the soil i have added really expensive organic soils and compost to this bed so i know that it's had a lot of good things go into it but because they are a small area my raised beds are three foot by five foot and i plant them every year again the soil is taken up with those things that we use the most and and so our plants have already used up a lot of those things but i add in every year so i think i should be really good and so like i said i know things get used up i've put a lot in and i have control of this way more than the great big garden so i'm anxious to see where we are and if i should feed this year or what i should do to make sure that i'm getting great crops and i usually do my kitchen garden where the raised beds are usually provides great produce healthy plants it's a beautiful garden when it's in full bloom so i think we should be just fine i will have for you in the description box ways that you can amend your soil if your ph is too high or too low if you need more potash if you need more nitrogen i will give some good ideas down in the description box below now i'm ready and look my soil is completely alkaline my veggies are not gonna like that at all i'm really glad i haven't planted yet nitrogen really low here isn't it wow i'm really surprised i have to say i'm really surprised i thought that this would be really good my potash is not too bad and my phosphorus could use a little bit more i'm very surprised i have to say this garden needs some work now that i'm done i'm giving everything a really good wash this stores back in this package really easily guys i'm gonna give this a five star review i'm so happy to have this test i loved everything about it thanks so much for coming along today and learning all about testing soil and learning the makeup and the nutrient value in your soil i sure learned a lot today some things i wasn't surprised but a couple things i was really surprised so i learned the fix for the big garden and this particular makeup is to add that compost mixture in before i plant it's going to really help this middle line the silt and really help keep moisture in my garden and not drain fast because it's sandy and also it's not going to change any of the nutrients but even though i used that same compost in my raised beds and added a good organic soil in there i was really shocked to see how depleted most of the nutrients were in those raised beds so now i have my work cut out for me i'm going to up that nitrogen content of the raised beds and do a couple other little twists before i plant them and i'm so glad i learned this because i'm planning on planting in just a couple of days here so i'm really glad i learned this information i hope it inspired you to take that extra step and learn a little bit more about what is in your soil so that your garden will be a success your plants will go strong healthy roots and produce an abundance of fruit so thank you so much for stopping by the farmhouse today guys and until next time be blessed and be safe and i'll see you soon
