 Hey, it's Jenny and we're out here in Monroe County. I've got my new friend with me, Jackson. Jackson, hi. Yeah, he's already ready. How hot do you think it is today? 93 degrees. He knew that right off the top of his head. I'm going to go with about 5,000 degrees, but whatever. And today, we're laying Polly Pipe in the field behind me. Okay, what does Polly Pipe do? It helps water our fields. Helps water your fields. And what field will we be watering? I don't know the exact name of it, but bean field. A bean field. All right. Well, do we actually need that today or is that just to keep some people back? No, we'll be needing sure. All right, just checking. Just want to make sure for my safety. All right, so before we lay, I mean, do we need to get stretching? Do we need to be limber for this? What? No, you're just going to be walking to the other end of the field. Okay, you're not going to do it? Okay, I'm going to get my toes and I'm just going to limber this way and this way. You know, feel free to join in anytime that you're going to do it. Okay, all right. That's fine. All right. What is this? It's a pivot from where the pipe comes out of the ground. Okay, so this is like our water source? Yeah, so the well over there is sucking out of the ground and there's a pipe that brings it up here. Okay, and this is the Polly that we're laying. All right, so what are we going to do? We're going to follow this tractor. Cisco. And he's going to be making a ditch underneath the ground. All right, so what are we going to do? We're going to follow this tractor. Cisco. Uh-huh. And he's going to be making a ditch underneath there. Uh-huh. And it's going to stretch it out across the field. And then about this row and that row will get water, but this row won't. Okay. Okay. All right, and what are we going to do behind it? I got to put dirt on it so it doesn't blow off. All right, well, why don't I follow you? You can show me how to do that and maybe I can give it a go. Maybe? Yeah. Would you be cool with that? Yeah. All right, cool. All right. So we're trying to water from this side of the field because there's a hill slanting. That way. And the water will fall down that. Okay. But we're going to lay it across this way for it to go that way. Got it. Yes. All right. All right, let's see this. Let's lay some dirt. All right, so this takes a lot of concentration. No, I mean. What? Did you say no? You're walking on a polypite. Yeah, but there's like dirt everywhere. I mean, I guess. I feel like this is. I'm just waiting to eat it, you know? Well, if you eat it, you'd probably have stitches in your chin. Okay, that's good. Chill. Chill. Do you have you ever fallen doing this? Yes. Okay, that makes me feel better. Five steps. Put a shovel of dirt on the polypite. All right, let's do it. You switch. Like right here? Yeah. That enough. That enough? Probably. Just a shovel full. Just a shovel full. Just a shovel dirt? That's all it is. You're making this look a lot smoother. Yeah. We sure did pick a hot day, didn't we? Yeah. Good and hot day, too. That's half the work. That's half the work. That's half? Half the work? Cool. Cool, cool. All right, I'm going to grab some of that water. All right, Jackson. What we got here today? It's a well. It pulls water out of the ground to put it in our polypipes so we can pop them. All right, so what we just laid down, water's about to flow through it and that's all coming from here. Yes. So what do you have to do to make this flow? You just turn a lever? He turns it on. That's it. You just turn it on. You turn it on, water shows up. All right, and we're about to go pop? Yes. What do we call it? A popper. A popper is what you have. Yes. This is not a medieval weapon. This is an agriculture icon. Popper. Yeah. All right, so you're going to show me how we do the popper next. Yep. All right, well, let's go do it. What is that? Oh! John! We got adult kid farmer John over here. Did you know that was going to happen? Yes. On that well down there, that's what it's called, right? Yeah. We laid the polypipes and that water's pushing through here? Mm-hmm. Okay. And then we take that poker that you had? Yeah. We got to find that thing. And we basically poke holes in here and that's on the water. Shoes down that way? Yep. Anything else we need to know about this? Like what's happening down there? What's Cisco doing down at the... He's holding water pressure down there so the water can't go past him. Okay. Okay. Anything else about this? Are there certain holes? Are there certain size holes? Yeah, there's a bunch. You can have an inch, half inch, all variations and it depends on how long your field is. So if you have like a really short and skinny field, you can do like an inch, a hole. But if you had a long field like we have here, we're doing half inch today. So when we're done, when you're done with this polypipe, when you're done watering the field, what do you do with it? We recycle it. You recycle it. Make the world a better place. Woo! I figure words of encouragement are better than me being over there. Good job, Jack J. Good hard day's work, Jackson. Yeah? Yeah, but we're not nearly done. Wait, what? Yeah. How are we still not done? No, I got a rest of the day to go. Oh, alright. Well, I think my job here is done. Thank you so much for helping me lay polypots. It's been good. I'm gonna go hit your ride somewhere over there. And there you go...
