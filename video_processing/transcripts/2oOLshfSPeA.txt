 Music One of the most exciting projects we're working on in the Wet Tropics is called the Major Integrated Project. It's working in the Johnson and the Tully catchments in the Wet Tropics. The key thing with the Major Integrated Project is it's not just about water quality for the reef, it's about sustainable communities. This project is really important to us because it's about a grassroots design. Rural communities in Queensland are really important to everybody, those small towns. We've been through disasters, we've got ups and downs with agricultural prices, but we're all trying to work together and actually ensuring that we're here for the long term.
