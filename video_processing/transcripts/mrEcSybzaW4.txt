 When growing basil on an aeroponic tower, you can expect abundant yields. However, it is important to know that basil requires six seeds per hole for the propagation process. This will allow you to achieve a nice cluster of basil. It then takes about three weeks until your basil seedlings are ready for transplanting on the aeroponic tower. And after six weeks of growth, your basil will be ready to harvest and you can make yourself a nice batch of homemade pesto.
