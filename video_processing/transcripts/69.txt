 One of my favorite plants to complement the garden are peppers. Peppers come in lots of different shapes and sizes. They certainly come in lots of flavors, and there should be a pepper that just about anyone can use and like. Peppers do well in a high organic matter soil, and they love full sun. They have to be planted after the last frost, but they do survive pretty well in cooler weather. And then when they really start growing is when it really gets warmed up. They tolerate heat better than almost all of our garden vegetables. They like warm temperatures enough that they do really well in hoop houses, greenhouses, and that type of situation where we're adding heat. There's hot peppers, there's mild peppers, you can eat them like an apple, and then there's some that, boy, you don't want to eat plain. Peppers are wonderful to use in your garden to complement your other vegetables. They grow really well and they do well in most gardens. They have all types of uses in the kitchen. You can take the hot peppers, the smaller peppers, and just pop them in a Ziploc bag, put them in the freezer. You've got them all winter long to use. The bigger sweet peppers, we can dice them up, put them in an old style ice cube tray with water, freeze them, and then pop them in a Ziploc bag. Anytime you're going to make fresh salts or soups, just take them out and put them in what you want to use. Of course, the best way to eat a pepper is to eat the sweet ones like an apple all summer long, warm off the vine. This is Hudson Hill with the University of Wyoming Extension.
