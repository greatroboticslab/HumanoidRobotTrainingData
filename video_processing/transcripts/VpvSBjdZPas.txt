 Hello and welcome to an early morning episode. In this one I finally get to prune my apple trees. So right now we are about a week and a couple of days away from spring. Which is a little late to be honest. Ideally you would do this in January or February. But the buds haven't broken yet. There's no green showing. So it's not too late. We're still good. So I'm gonna do it now. Now these trees are one year old. Which means I've had them for one year. I think when I got them they were probably about a year old. You know for the nursery to grow them. Because obviously they have to get them up to size. So they're about two years old in total now. It is pretty normal for your tree to be about one or two years old. Now as far as pruning goes. There's a couple different choices. Most commonly for apples and pears. You would prune them to what's called a central leader. Which is where you have a single trunk coming up. And then anywhere from three to five branches coming off horizontally. Where all your fruit is gonna be on. These branches are ideally spaced out pretty evenly. So let's say two or three inches or about ten centimeters apart. So they all get their own light. And they all face a different direction. So like north, south, south, east, west. You know they all get their own little space. All facing out a different direction. All around the center of the tree. From the center of the tree. Alternatively you could also prune them. And this is most common for stone fruits. In something that's called a vase shape. Or also called an open center. This what you do is you lop off the top of the tree. Usually about 30 centimeters or about a foot off the ground. So like say right here. Maybe a branch left over. They will all come off down here. About three or four branches shooting up. Again spaced out evenly. But they're all coming from the same point. That causes problems when you have snow or anything like that. Weighing down on those branches. That's why it's not ideal. These branches they might snipe off. So what I'm going to be doing. Is pruning my apple trees into something that's called. A modified central leader. I got this idea from Steven Edholm from Skill Cult. So give credit where credit is due. I was always going to do a central leader. But a modified central leader sounds even better. This is where you're combining the central leader. And the vase shape combined. You have your branches coming out. Evenly along the trunk. And they're all growing up. To kind of compete with that central leader. So you don't get that too much of that apical dominance. Which is apples and pears like to do. So you have about three or four branches. Ideally coming out horizontally. Growing up. All competing then for that. For that main apical dominance. Which helps to keep your tree small. And I'll explain and document. And show you how I'm going to do this. As we go along. So with that said. Let's get down to the first tree. Which is my Calypso. So with the one year old apple tree. There's really not a whole lot of pruning that you have to do. It's more so just guiding it into the form. That you're trying to train your fruit tree in. And as you do this every year. You'll find that there's just. It's just maintaining. The shape that you have set up for your tree. And it becomes very little work really. So the first branch is pretty obvious. You can see it's swooping down. Ideally this tree was swooping over a little bit more. And I had it tied up at the top here. To kind of straighten it out. Because it was very. It was leaning over a lot. And that caused this branch. Which was horizontal. To be very swooping. So I'm going to correct that. First off. And how we're going to do that. Is by. Pruning it down to a bud. That it comes out more horizontally. And ideally. It's on the top here. So it'll also swoop up a little bit. So this bud right here. Fits that build perfectly. So I'm just going to prune it down to this bud. Which will take off. All that swooping. Motion that we've got going on currently. So here we go. We're going to leave a little bit of a stub right there. Just like that. It takes off all that swooping action. That we don't want. There's only one other branch. That I want to prune on this tree. And that's at the top. So let me show you that now. So as you can see. I still have it tied up. Although I could probably remove that after this year. As you can also see. I've got way more than the three to five branches that I was suggesting. I'm not really worried about it. I'm going to do my own interpretation of it. I feel like as long as it has. You know light. Then it should be fine. Then it will be fine. I guess it's going to be a little bit of an experiment. But I know it'll be fine. A lot of this is also fruiting wood. Like this. Back here. There's some fruiting wood. I've even got some up here. And down here. And I obviously don't want to remove that. Down here. I obviously don't want to remove that. So there's a lot of branches I'll be leaving. But I'm going to be maintaining it over the years. And I'll be taking you guys along. Now. The branch that I was talking about. Is that. Little fork that you have here. And this is kind of what I'm talking about. With guiding the tree. You can see that I've got two branches coming off of the same area. Which is not ideal. That's going to swell up. So you're just going to want to remove one of them. However. If you look a little further. You can see that. This branch. Is already here. Which currently is being shared. Right above this one. So that's not good. These two are going to compete. For light. So ideally what I want to do. Is remove this one. And then just let this one. Take over. Because this has more of its own area. You know. This one is a little. Is going on a slightly different angle. Than this one down below here. So. That's the type of things. I would want you to think about. When you're making these pruning cuts. Now. I'm going to prune this. Which might start sparking. Little buds. And growth happening at the cut point here. Which you're going to want to take out. When the time comes. You could just rub off the little. Little buds there. Leave a little bit of a stub. And there we go. So there's a little bit of a stub there. Just a little bit of a stub. And it's going to have more branch spark out. And we're going to want to remove those. Because we already have a main branch. In this one. That's already going to be the main scaffold. So we don't need. That branch. Any branches beside it. So that's pretty much this tree done. It's. It's very minor. Like I said. It's. It's just small changes that you're making. To the tree. So let's go on to the next one now. So this is my. A disso apple. And I'm really glad that I have multiple trees to prune. Because it really allows me to show you some of the different scenarios. That you're going to run into. When you're pruning your trees. So with this one. There's really only one branch that I want to remove. And. That's. The fact that they have two central leaders. You don't want that. You want just a single central leader. So that. You know. You just have one single trunk coming up. Where all the energy can go into. Having two is not good. It's just going to compete. They're just going to compete together. And you just don't want that. Ideally you just have one. Where all the energy can go into. I'm going to leave this. Branch right here. This could be a side branch. Or alternatively really. What you could do. Is if you didn't. So let's say I didn't want this branch here. What I could do. Is prune it off. Right there. It would then have. A new. Leader here. To take over. Rather than this one. But I don't mind this branch being here. So I can just prune this lower one off. And that. Is what I'm going to do. So. Same thing with the other one. We'll leave a little bit of a stub here. And any branches that are going to come off of it. I might remove. We'll just take it. As it happens. A bit of a stub. It's kind of hard to do one handed. But there it goes. And that's really all I want to do to this tree. One single leader. Alternatively. If I didn't want it to be this high. I could. Take down this height. Down a little bit. This might be too high. Ah. I don't mind. My tree being about seven or eight foot high. So I'm going to leave it in this case. But you might decide. That you want to reduce the height on this a little bit. In which case. You would just take it. Down to one of these buds. That grows a favorable direction. So I can take over. You know what? Actually. I might just take it off a little bit. Because you're going to get. I'm going to prune this off. And I'm going to have essentially a second. Row of scaffolds. That are going to be the canopy of the tree up here. That's part of the modified central leader. The second leader. Technique there. Is to have. Your scaffolds down low. And have your central leader. All the way to the tippy top. Have a second. Second set of scaffolds. That are going to keep it small. So I thought I could have it. To be a little bit taller. But. You're going to have to take that second scaffold. In the top here. You have to keep that in mind. So I actually will have to prune this off. Because if I have a scaffold up top here. That's going to be way too tall. Even for me. So I'm going to prune it down a little bit. And then see where that goes. So I'm going to take. I'm going to take it down. This is probably about. Two meters. So about seven foot. Then you have to add on another foot. For the second set of scaffolds. So. I'm going to take it down to here. Fair chunk. We'll start with that. And always adjust later. All right. So here we go. Boom. And that's it. So yeah. So this is going to. This is going to subdivide all along here. Over the course of the growing season. Because you know. What they do is. They send up a long. Straight shoot. And then they subdivide. Later on. So we'll see where the branches come out. And next year. We'll take the next step. Onto the next tree. So the last tree here. It's going to mesh it in with this red maple here. But. It's the same thing. You can see here. This. This main scaffold. It's coming out. Way too vertical. Cool. Okay. You can see how. It's not coming out horizontal. Like at all. Like maybe this branch down here. Is actually a perfect example. This comes out nice and horizontal. This one. Really wants to be the main leader. I don't want it to be the main leader. Because I already have a main leader. So this one has to come out. That's what's going to be. The first operation here. Get in there. Spoon it off. And you can just see. How tall it got. Hello kitty. Yeah. So it just got way too tall. I'm going to be shooting for about. Seven foot. As well. And then that extra scaffold. The last top scaffold. Will be another foot. So that'll make it eight feet. Which. You know. I'm relatively tall. So that should be comfortable for me. Obviously you can adjust this. To whatever is comfortable for you. This is about seven foot. Leave a little bit of a stub here. Take all that top growth off. Here we go. Boom. It's done. So that's all the pruning. I'll be doing. On my apple trees this year. It's not very much. Like I said. In the first year. You won't have to do a whole lot. And if you just do it every year. It'll just become. Just maintaining. It's very easy. Alright guys. So that's all the pruning. I'm going to be doing this year. On these apple trees. And. Yeah. I really feel like this. Modified central leader. Is going to be the best way to go about it. For these apple trees. I just think it's going to be. A much more natural looking tree. Rather than. You know. The pretty. Tailored and catered to. Trees that you see in a normal orchard. I feel like this is going to look more natural. And I also think it's going to be more healthy. In the long run. Because it is. You know. There's more. More branching. And better branching. And all that stuff going out. And not like the vase shape. I just. I'm not a big fan of it. Even when I do get stone fruit at some point. I'll probably be. Pruning them in a similar fashion. To be honest. And we'll just kind of see how that goes. So. I appreciate you coming along. Thank you for watching. And we'll see you in the next one. Tot de volgende keer. Tens. Bye.
