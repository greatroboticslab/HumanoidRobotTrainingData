 Watering your garden is one of the most basic tasks for a school gardener. It can also be one of the most complicated and time-consuming tasks as well. Drip irrigation is a great watering system because it is more water efficient and time efficient than hand watering. We talked to Sean from the Governor's Island Teaching Garden to learn more about how to install a drip irrigation system. Hello! Alright, let's do this. So the drip irrigation system is pretty simple. It has about five different parts to it. And together what they'll do is allow you to irrigate your garden without having to hand water. It will save you time, it's healthier for your plants. It will make you the envy of the school gardening community. This kit that we have here is a very simple one and it just has five parts to it. There's a filter. There's a pressure regulator. There's an adapter. There's a main line. And then there's the drip tape. The first part of your drip irrigation system is your filter. The filter either attaches to a garden hose or it attaches to a spigot. The water coming out of your hose or out of your spigot probably has a little bit of sediment in it. So what the filter does is it catches that sediment. There's a little filter in there. And it prevents it from going further down the system. If that sediment continues into the drip irrigation, it could block the emitters. The next part of our drip irrigation kit is our pressure regulator. It attaches to the filter. And what the pressure regulator does is it ensures that there's not too much pressure in the rest of the drip irrigation system. The next part of our system is the adapter. It attaches to the pressure regulator. It allows the pressure regulator and the filter to attach to the main line. Attaching the adapter to the main line is pretty simple. You just unscrew it, press the main line in, and then screw it back on. What that does is make sure it's on there really tight. The next part of our system is the main line. The main line doesn't have any emitters on it, so the main line doesn't release any water. It brings it to the garden bed that you want to water. In a way you could think of it as a kind of a hose. The main line attaches to the drip tape. And the drip tape has emitters on it. This style of drip tape has emitters every 12 inches. But you can buy drip tape with emitters every 6 inches or every 18 inches. Attaching the drip tape to the main line is very simple. Each kit has a different way of doing it. But the kit we're using today involves two steps. First, you want to punch a hole in the main line. So I have this funny little tool. What I do is I just press it into the main line, make a hole. You want to be careful that you don't press so hard that you punch a hole through the other side. Alright. Then you take this funny looking connector piece. And you insert it into the hole. Alright. And then you take your drip tape. And you attach it into the funny connector piece. Close it up. That's on there tight. Not going anywhere. And what that does is water will come through the main line. Go through this connector piece into the drip tape. And then the drip tape has emitters every 6 or 12 or 18 inches. And that water then will drip into your garden. At the end of each piece of drip line, you're going to want to close off the end. So different systems have different ways of doing that. Some systems will have you fold the end down and put a rubber band over it. The system we're using today has you take an end piece, just fit it into the end there, and then you lock it shut. You're also going to want to close off the end of your main line. So you take another, a different type of end piece with this kit. You press it in. You lock it. And then this kit actually has a cap that goes on the end. And now your system is totally closed. It's easy to adapt this setup if you need to have multiple main lines. For example, if you have garden beds on different sides of the spigot. You can spray it, you'll find a slot. You can have a chain of hedger masturb beds dry into the pressure. The Il거�ensional fund filled it up you'll need to keep in mind. It's the main line PDs Esprault, even though it's pretty gentle before I change it. What you do is after the pressure regulator you can add a splitter piece. The splitter piece screws in to the pressure regulator. Once your splitter is screwed in, you can then add two different main-line pieces. line pieces. You attach the first and the second main line pieces with the adapters in the kit. You can direct your main lines around your garden and build out your system from there. You can use a tee piece or an elbow piece to guide your main line throughout your garden. For example, if you have sharp corners or if you want to irrigate multiple consecutive garden beds. Drip tape can be installed in rows or drilled into the side of your garden bed. Your drip tape can be placed in a circle around the plants in your garden bed. Look online or at your nearest garden supply store to research the best drip irrigation kit for your garden.
