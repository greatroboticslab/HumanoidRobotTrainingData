 In a small community in the Pacific Northwest, a dynamic company is growing. This company has served the equipment dealer market for 30 years. They did it by following their principles, by being the best and by being honest to their customers. DIS. Technology Driven. People Focused. The merger between Case and International Harvester and the subsequent multiple dealers that had the competing lines. Yeah, that created an opportunity for them to get rid of a whole bunch of dealers and it created an opportunity for us to consolidate our existing dealership with a case company store that was at Janesville, Wisconsin. And so that's really what was a launching pad for us in 1986, right? Correct. Yeah. We bought the case company store lock, stock and barrel, but didn't include the real estate. So we bought, we bought the new inventory, the used inventory, the parts, the service tools, all of the furniture and fixtures. I don't think there were any trucks involved in it, which was okay. And they insisted that when we came to the closing that we brought a cashier's check for $500. They, the cost of the parts books that they wanted, we'd agreed at $500. Everything else was sign here, sign here, sign here. One was on a three year note for 0%, one was on a five year note for 1%, and one was on a three year lease for 2%. And it was the, it was the most unique financing package that you could possibly ask for. And, and we were both young and stupid at the time, so it didn't make any difference whether, whether it all worked or not, but it, it did. That's why we're here today. Our purchase of this Rochelle, Illinois store came about after a case had a change in philosophy with the existing owner. And he put the business up for sale and had run a very successful dealership here with a really good service department, service department had an excellent reputation for quality service department and a real depth in parts we were able to negotiate a deal with him in 2006 an asset sale yeah and so we bought it lock stock and barrel bought the building bought the everything he had here and hired essentially everybody that worked here and and it's it's been mutually beneficial ever since been a great location Rochelle Illinois is called the hub city and there's a there's a five or six railroads that all converge here and but the other great thing for us is that there's two major highways that intersect here interstate 88 and interstate 39 and so from anywhere in northern Illinois to get to Rochelle is an easy drive Rochelle is not a huge city but it still offers most of the amenities that our employees want you know it's it's got some nice restaurants and good school system and and really really a nice quality of life town and for us it's a great thing because we can advertise a combine in Iowa or as or or southern Illinois or wherever and and it's not too bad a drive for most any farmer to come and buy Jamesville is about 50 miles north there are no other case age dealers between at the moment there are no other case age dealers between us and Lake Michigan and Chicago in between and that's about 70 miles to the east same story with Janesville one small dealer to the directly to the east and in near the Racine area but we have about nine counties of responsibility and are able to be a player in most of the counties even though they're not all AG in a small community in the Pacific Northwest a dynamic company is growing this company has served the equipment dealer market for 30 years they did it by following their principles by being the best and by being honest to their customers fais dis technology driven people focused you
