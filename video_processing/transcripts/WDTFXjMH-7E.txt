 hello everyone welcome back to our channel so for today's video we are going to do on monsoon and its current status of the monsoon in india as well as its impact on agriculture okay so um and we're also trying to do some few questions we're going to solve them as well as we're going to explain some of the questions and uh which is very important from the exam point of view especially for this agri-metology i think at least about one or two questions high concerns or with this minimum of two questions coming from this topic okay so guys watch this video till the end my name is hansa norasama and i've done a bachelor's in horticulture and i've also completed my post-graduation in nematology in agriculture okay so before going further if you guys are new to this channel please don't forget to subscribe and you can also press the bell icon for further notifications and do share with your friends and if you guys have enjoyed this session don't forget to hit the thumbs up button as well so um in the first slide we are going to talk something about this monsoon how uh so there has been an increase in sowing uh because of the good monsoon by 87 percent so we're just gonna have a rough talk and rough overview about the monsoon in general right as well as in the uh indian economy and agriculture so the first line here says about third of the indus manufacturing output which makes up about 18 percent of the country's gross domestic product is linked to agriculture and therefore into the food right and the second point here is the monsoon it is a lifeboat uh basically for indian's agriculture and dependent on about two trillion dollars of economy and at least half of the farmlands are rain fed and when we're going to talk about rain fed rain fed areas are the areas or the farms where there is no facility for irrigation no irrigation facilities so they are totally dependent on rainfall for the crop production all right and now this in this agriculture sector they also account for about 14 percent of the country's uh 2.7 trillion economy which is the one one uh which we were talking about and about 42 percent of the total employment so agriculture is a huge sector where it gives about majority almost half of the employment when it comes to agriculture practices in india okay and 55 percent of the indus arable land dependent on precipitation right so when you say 55 it means basically it's a rain fed uh farms or the rain fed lands okay um so 55 percent of it these are completely dependent on precipitation so precipitation is just another word for rainfall right so i hope this is clear and now let's move on to our new slide where we're going to talk why there is an increase how is there an increase so basically uh due to the good rainfall in the month of june the basic important key crops so many areas that have increased by about 87 percent and when we compare this percentage to the last year so there has been increased by 87 percent there it is huge range right so uh rice cultivation is basically a curve crop so rice now in the modern season rises the major curve crop so they are growing this at a huge amount of number at a huge area okay so these are grown nearly 40 percent of the total area during the curve crop season and is up to about 39 percent okay so the oil seeds they have risen more than three times of its normal production and the cultivation and as if you're going to talk about pulses then it has had a piece of about quadrupleit which means four times okay so um these are something overview about these monsoons and especially as rice is a very water intensive um crop so i think a lot of water is needed so due to this uh good rainfall in this year in june so the right production is also high chances of rice production as well um states like bihar punjab and haryana they are one of the major moving um agriculture states in our country where they have grown where they grow a lot of career season especially for rice weeds maize all of that pulses especially these are the main good monsoon they also helped the farmers increase the sowing area okay so these are some of the overview and some of the impact that this monsoon has on the indian economy is that these are um basically of the monsoon they have direct impact on the country's agricultural gdp right so the planting of this key karif season which is the season for now or summer crops like rice sugar cane pulses and oil seeds they begin with the arrival or the onset of the monsoon rains in the june right and due to this when you have a good production when there's a good rainfall the quality the quantity of and the sowing area will also increase and therefore there'll be higher production and in the end they'll have a better income right so and even uh the summer crops they also account for almost half of interest food output and delayed or the permy monsoon it means issues and acceleration in the food inflation as well so this is also a problem so if you have a good output to the summer predict predict the summer crowd they are the major crops for the india's food output and there will be if the monsoon is per the production will also be lesser and therefore there'll be uh supply issues and supply as well as they'll be having a full inflation okay so another point that i want to focus here is that especially in a poor monsoon they'll also not lead to demand or to weak demand or fast-moving consumer goods as well if the two-wheelers attractors rule housing sectors all of these will also have an impact uh by the import of its essential food staples and they will also force the government to take measures like loan waivers and thereby they will also put more pressure on the finances as well a lot of important point is that a weak monsoon is strong correlate is strongly correlated to the receding water table in the ground and this will also worsen the farmers distress okay so these are some of the impacts that this monsoon has on indian agriculture and thereby on an indian economy i hope this is clear um now let's move on to another slide where i've just given some variable uh rainfall variability in india right so basically in rainfall where we talk about the way for variability in the indian subcontinent they contain uh they receive its annual rainfall by this peculiar phenomenon which we call it monsoon right and basically it consists of a cyclone that arise in the indian ocean okay and this uh cyclone in the indian ocean they travel in the northeast direction towards that side and they enter the peninsular region along its west coast so the cup they go around the whole of peninsular indian region and they enter to the west coast all right so something important um a rainfall variability or the type of monsoon systems in india that we can find uh the major two ones are southwest mountain as you can see here in the first point and we also have a northwest monsoon right so we also have a winter rainfall as well as in this summer rainfall and i'm just briefly talk about what this uh southwest monsoon northeast monsoon etc all of these are okay so um this first thing this southwest monsoon this is one of the most important of monsoon season in india as it contributes to about about 80 to 90 percent of the total rainfall in the country uh the mo this is one of the most important cycles uh cycle cycles and they usually occur in the month of june to september and this results in the month summer monsoon so southwest monsoon is also known as the summer monsoon right and now let's go to our second point which is on the northeast monsoon so uh in northeast monsoon these are this occurs during the month of september and right so the northwest monsoon they penetrate the northwestern india and but it stays a full month in the eastern india which is in bangal okay so um these are some of the things on the northwest monsoon i think that's enough for you all to know and we also have winter rainfall so it's winter rainfall it is mostly restricted to the northern area or the northern indian and it is basically uh suppose if it's in the hilly regions or the malian regions then it will form in the form of a snow and if it's in plain regions then the rains will come okay so these are something on the winter rainfall and now lastly we're going to talk about the summer rainfall so in summer rainfall uh the uh the the rainfall is basically received in the march of march um to may okay so so these are which is received during this summer months as a local storms right so these are mostly received in the southeast of the peninsula or in the west and all right so basically the western indian side they are not generally um affected by this summer rainfall or they do not receive this rainfall okay so these are something important uh points it's not really important from the exam point of view but i think uh it's very important to at least know the types of monsoons in india that we have all right and now let's go to another question uh go with the question series the first option says the cross region the crop region they are classified based on average rainfall okay and which of the following range comes under this semi-ed region so based on the uh rainfall received annually this field uh they have classified these regions into different regions all right um the first option given here is less than 500 number b says 500 to 700 number c is 750 to 1000 number d is 1000 to 1500 and number e is more than 1500 right so right answer for this is 700 500 to 750 okay so based here if you can see the uh lower table i've given on the left hand side given the rainfall in the meter and on the right hand side you can see the climatic regions all right so um this table is very important guys if you guys are learning it for the first time please remember i would request you all to take a screenshot of the screen and you can also jot it down if you're having a notepad besides you can just pause the video and jot it down okay so okay first thing less than 500 it is in the area region right and we have 500 to 700 means in this semi-air region uh 750 to 1000 it's in the sub-airate and more than 1000 it's in the humid so these are the list of the rainfall ranges as well as along with the regions right so i think this is very important from uh the high chances of this question coming in the exam okay um another one here is under reflective solar radiation without any change in quality is known as the options given here are the radiation flux number b is emission power number c is albedo number d is latent heat and we also have number e which says sensible heat affection okay so guys the right answer for this is albedo so albedo what is this albedo it is basically just the measurement of the reflectivity of an object okay so the solar radiation enters the earth right and some of it these are absorbed and some of it these are reflected back so albedo is basically the reflected back without any change these are the uh radiations solar radiations which are reflected back without any change in its quantity or the quality okay okay so this is what an albedo is okay so in other words it is a measure of the diffuse reflection of the solar radiation after this total radiation received by an astronomical body so according to this definition we can say that every object has different albedo okay uh in this um point i've given this is a very important point i've given some of the albedo um percentages of different elements okay the first one is the pure water so pure water is an albedo for about five to twenty percent okay and we're going to talk about vegetation it's about 10 to 40 percent and for soil it's about 15 to 50 percent and if we're going to talk about earth we have about 34 to 43 so roughly we're going to talk a static average for earth then they say it's about 35 percent okay and if it's for clouds then we have about 55 percent and especially at this point if you're going to come down here uh when you talk about plans for the plant community this albedo uh the absorption of sorry the reflection of the solar radiation they they depend on the first thing is on the age of the crop the second is the percentage of the ground cover as well as the last one is and the color and reflectivity of the foliage okay so these are some of the points on albedo that you guys need to remember another point is that here on earth especially the albedo effect they have a very significant impact on the climate as well so the lower the albedo right to lower the percentage of the albedo the more radiation from the sun that get absorbed by the planet okay and therefore the temperature will rise but if the albedo is higher then the earth is more reflective and more of the radiation is returned to the space and the planet cools so these are something on so you can you're getting the pattern right so vegetation it's about it's towards the highest so we have more vegetation ground cover then definitely the earth will be lesser um less cool um sorry will be cooler okay so um uh in the question you can see that we have already come across a few of the um state a few of the definite a few of the terms right so now let us understand what these terms are okay so basically the first one is in the radiation flux so uh radiation flux uh these are the amount of gradient energy which are emitted as well as which are received and transmitted across a particular area and this is known as a radiant flux okay and the second one here is on the emissive power uh so when you have the radiant uh radiation flux the density of this radiant flush is basically emitted by a source right and this is called as the emissive power okay so this is what an emissive power is and albedo we have already discussed what an albedo is and now we have a latent heat so a latent heat is a part of an incident radiation on the surface if absorbed and while a part of it is reflected and the remaining is basically transmitted so these are uh latent heat what a latent heat is so we also have the last option was given here the last option given here is on a sensible heat advection right so sensible heat advection as well as the slated heat they are the types of this energy which are basically released or absorbed in the atmosphere okay but this latent heat these are most related to the changes in the phase of between the liquids the gases and the solids whereas in the sensible heat these are mostly related to the temperature which of the gas or the object with no change of the phase right so an example right so these are some of the terms the definitions of this so try to know the at least the definitions i think just knowing the definition will also suffice okay all right so um let's go to another slide which is on which of the following crop is or are considered as a short day plan so this is a very easy question again but very important okay so the options given here are number a is potato we have b which is rice we have c which is wheat and d these and e is all of the above okay so guys the right answer for this is rice rises the short day plant right so now let us talk about the duration of light right so based on the classification of this plant these are based classified into a few groups three groups mainly on the basis of photoperiodism and if you're going to ask what is photoperiodism a photoperiodism is a response of a plan to the relative uh length of the day and night and this is known as photoperiodism okay and this photoperiodism it influences um the plant character the flower initiation or development both have bulb and rhizome production etc so these are some of the facts and some of the points where these photoperiodism they affect the plant okay um the first one here is in the short day plan we also have long day and we have a day neutral plant right so this duration of the light they have a great influence than the intensity for the canopy as well as for the final needles okay guys um it is very important to consider this in the selection of the crop varieties especially the crop varieties and the short day plans if you're going to look at that these are the plants which basically develop normally when they develop normally when the photo period is uh less than the critical maximum okay so the critical maximum is less than 12 hours right so these are what short day plans are and now when we look into this long day plans this longer plans these are the plants which develop and they produce normally when the photo period is greater than the max critical minimum which is greater than the 12 hours so this longer plans they needed to a day length of about more than 12 hours and now the last one here is of the day neutral plant and the day neutral plant basically these are the plants or those plants which are not affected by the photo period okay i hope this is clear and now let's go to another a slide where i've just given some of the examples along with in the table along the short day plan long day plan and day neutral okay so let me just read out the for the short day plans we have chrysanthemum cockleberg cosmos dahlia goose food we have hemp morning glory poinsettia these are all flowers okay guys and we have rice soybean we have tobacco we have violets so these are also another flowers and now let us look into longer plants for long day we have barley cabbage carrots handbane we have luxe these are also um flowering plants we have lettuce onion petunia poppy these are flowers radish spinach and beet and if you're going to look into day neutral plants we have balsam these are also flowers okay and we have uh beans chilis capsicum to be sorry tomato cotton cucumber a maize potato all of these these are under the day neutral plants okay um all right so now let's go to our fourth question who is the father of agri mythology in india okay so guys um the right answer for this is okay so before that before giving the right answer let me just read out the options uh the options given here are number a is m swaminathan we have b which is la ramdas c is bp paul and d is jw leather and number e is none of the above so guys the right answer for this is is is la ramdas so he is the man who is the father of the agri-metology in india right so in that way try to study for the fathers of um different other allied subjects under agriculture we also have for soil science agronomi agriculture engineering try to list out all the fathers of his respective discipline and jot it down i think it'll be more much more easier for you guys if you can make a table out of this and you can study in that way okay so um a last question here i would like you all to answer for this again so which of the following range of the wavelength they help in photosynthetic and a few photoperiodic activity so we do have certain a range of wavelengths which help in certain uh growth and production and for certain effects that it has a particular function that it has on the plant okay so this question is based on that right so uh think carefully and drop it in the comment section all right guys so the options i'm going to read out that number a is 720 to 510 number b is 1000 number c is more than 1000 number d is 500 to 400 number e is 400 to 300. out of these which one belongs to the range which helps in the photosynthetic as well as in the photoperiodic activity if you guys know the answer then do drop it in the comment section so that i'll be able to know right guys and before going uh let's just solve few of the questions quickly right so i've just given the questions here and i think it's quite small i don't know whether you guys are able to see or not if it's visible then but let me just increase the size of the right guys yeah i think this is more visible now okay so um number question number one was that indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm it is located in punay all right that it was established in the year of 1962 right and question number two is wind speed is measured by animometer rainfall is measured by rain gauge okay guys and we have a chemical which is used for artificial um rainfall i think this is an important question so you can jot it down i'm gonna put a star mark under this and we also have um the word monsoon it is derived from arabic language and the last one says that the radiation having thermal effects on the plant is uh the answer would be your infrared radiation so these are some of the questions that i've just quickly jotted down for that which i thought might be very important from the exam point of view okay guys um so that's all for today i hope that you guys had a productive session with me i hope it was clear for you all if you guys have more doubts or if you guys want me to take up some topic in which you guys are having trouble with or if you guys want me to explain those topics better then do drop it in the comments section and you can also reach out to us we're always there to help out right and um if you guys have any more doubts and queries do drop in the comment section okay exams are also there they have just given out for the nevart exam they've just given out the tentative dates but i'm not sure whether it's going to be in september or but uh till then till the actual dates come out i would like you all to uh request you all to continue revising for the exam as well as you can also uh have more time to prepare well so that you guys will have high chances of doing better in the exam right so guys if you are new to this channel please don't forget to
