 Do you know what an agronomist does? Agronomists are plant and soil scientists who conduct experiments to find better ways to manage our farms. Most agronomists work outdoors from time to time and you'd need to be prepared to get your hands dirty. You'll be working alongside farmers, researching ways to boost crops, control pests and weeds and protect the environment. This means you'll need to collect samples, perform experiments, advise farmers about the ways they can improve their work and you'll also be working with others to increase sustainable farming practices. Agronomists need to be interested in science and farming and you'll also need to be able to communicate well with others so you can share your findings. As an agronomist you'll need to be able to visit farms, although you may not need to live in a rural location. You don't have to go to university to become an agronomist, but you will probably need a vocational or TAFE qualification to get started. Most agronomists work full time during normal business hours and around 1 in 4 agronomists are women. It's a small industry, but it's growing fast and there's lots of demand for new agronomists. If you are interested in science and farming, see if you can find work experience or part-time work on a farm. Or take on a farm job such as fruit picking over the holidays. It'll help you work out if agriculture is the right place for you. Want to find out more? Head to StudyWork Grow for all the details.
