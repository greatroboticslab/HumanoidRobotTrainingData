And Bernie is anxious to get going. Good morning Bernie. Hi baby girl. Say hi. Say hi Maisie. Say hi. Alright you ready? Let's go. Come on. Not you. You're not ready yet. Alright let's go. Look at her trotting away. Look at that waddle. Look at that waddle. Looks like you're kind of full. Bernie knows exactly where she's going. Alright so we got ourselves a little bit of nice warm water. A washcloth. And we just give her a nice wipe down. Make sure she's all clean. We don't want any germs or dirt or dirt. Anything to fall down into our milk. We got another dry rag. Dry towel. Just dry her off. Not getting any loose hairs off. Huh. Alright. Alright. So. I got myself a little blue cup here. And we take. And we squeeze. A couple shots out. Let's see. Oh. No. Don't quit. Stop. Okay. She's really full today. So. I'm going to put you down for just a second. Just because. She's leaking. She's full. I don't want to lose anything. See that. I'm not even. I've been squeezing. She's already pushing out some milk there. Alright folks. I'm going to go ahead and milk her out. And I'll show you how much we have left when we're done. Okay.
