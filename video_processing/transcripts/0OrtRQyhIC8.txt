Science & Technology
 Good evening everyone. We are again here at the Loft Cinema. We are grateful to be here and we are grateful to see all of these faces here tonight. And I also want to greet all of our online guests as well. Thank you all so much for being here for our fourth 2023-2024 Archaeology Cafe event. This program and especially this season could just as easily be called Preservation Archaeology Cafe. Preservation Archaeology is at the heart of our mission and practice. But what does it mean exactly? Well in our view it's a holistic and conservation based approach to exploring and protecting heritage places while honoring their diverse values. Our vision is that heritage places, ancestral landscapes, and associated knowledge are valued, stewarded, protected, respected, and celebrated across the U.S. and the world. But before we dive into tonight's program let us take a moment to acknowledge and honor the land on which we are gathered. We recognize that we here in Tucson are on the land on the homelands of the Tohono O'odham Nation and the lands of the Pascu Yaqui Tribe. And we encourage all of you to take a moment to reflect on whose lands you are on tonight. I'd like to welcome tonight's presenter Michael Kotutua Johnson. He is a Hopi farmer, a University of Arizona faculty member, and an assistant specialist within the School of Natural Resources and the Environment. His presentation tonight is entitled Indigenous Agriculture Planting for Survival. Please join me in welcoming Dr. Johnson and thank you all for being here tonight. Thank you. Thank you everybody. So you know I kind of wanted to give just a little brief background about myself. You know like I always like to say that I'm a 250th generation farmer, 250th generation. You know somebody asked me how can I prove that and I said let's just look at the archaeological record. You know because I think that's important and so you know I was when I meet my friends from Iowa at Nebraska University that I always sit around have lunch sometimes and they tell me how long their family's been farming what generation are but when they drop their mouth when I say yeah I'm a little bit older than that. And so that's the cool thing. But you know I'm an assistant specialist at the University of Arizona at the School of Natural Resources and Environment but I'm also affiliated with the Indigenous Resilience Center which is very important because we're looking at issues in the nexus of food, water, and energy. And so that's something that we had started recently and it's something that I helped to help and use some of my work and some of my research which I'll talk about on on this particular presentation. But the title of my presentation as you can see is indigenous agriculture planting for survival. You know we've been doing that's it but the Hopi reservation for since about 3 000 years ago some would say time immemorial and so have a lot of the tribes here in the United States been doing the same thing. And so that's just the title of my presentation that's me out there planting the old school way and that's how it all began. You know that's how it all began. So I think you know one of the main things and one of the main things when we talk about archaeology we talk about preservation as she just said is that you know right now this statistic is kind of amazing that indigenous people protect 80 percent of global biodiversity on a mere 25 percent of the planet's land with less than five percent of the population. Why is that? You know why is it indigenous people control 80 percent of global biodiversity? It's kind of amazing when you think about it. So you know we've been we've been having these these type of grow outs with this diversity for a long long time and so you know it's just that that's one of the facts that I like to use because this is why it's important. This is why we're still here. So when I talk about biodiversity not only do we have not only do we have plant species biodiversity here in the United States we sit upon four five point four percent of what I call key biodiversity areas even though we reside in only two percent of the land here in the U.S. To me that's astronomical but also on these plants of on these plants of rich biodiversity species biodiversity we also have language biodiversity rich rich languages that are out there. So they correspond in that and I'm going to talk about that. It's kind of it's kind of showing a demonstration of how we have this relationship with our environment and what and what we use to survive in these particular conditions. Okay so right now we're looking at current climate solutions for the short short term you know this is kind of a little bit what I want to talk about here is like you know scientific derived environmental solutions are too narrowly based. Nature is still approached from a point of commodification and the market system drivers counter nature based solutions. So what are the kind of examples that and I'm going to tell you why it's important and this is why we need indigenous people in our crop biodiversity within also throughout the world to survive some of these things. Right now if you when I was up at the UCAR up in Colorado I was talking to the crop modelists they're still still looking at basically six major crops those are spread throughout the globe so you're looking at maize, soybeans, rice, wheat, corn, and sugar cane. So they're always trying to find ways to do that. The problem with this is is that these have a lot of variables these have a lot of inputs that are associated with that things like herbicides pesticides you know there a lot of them require a lot of water and as the temperatures of the globe heat up they're having a hard time trying to manage these. Now their only solution to to keep this type of adversity is basically just cover crops and no till. That's it. When I asked them why aren't they praising things that people have been eating all these generations and they really didn't have an answer to that. Some could say this for corporations because the corporations run a lot of all of this and so that's kind of why they're just focusing on those six major crops. Some people say that we need to feed a billion people so we got to use these six major crops but these crops right here aren't really nutritional value for one and also most 70 percent of our production in this country or in the world is is raised on food production is raised on only farms of one to five acres 70 percent of that and so this is just another way of doing these type of things. So why is this important because why is biodiversity is important because half of all global gross domestic products the GDP relies upon nature and its biodiversity. So you would think that we sit on 80 percent of biodiversity so how come we don't have half the national gross domestic product on our reservations in our territories. No you have to wonder about that and so it's just because we haven't really got into the mainstream of things but you know we are who we are and you know we represent who we do but we're looking at to me this is a really good statistic. So why is this important crop and genetic biodiversity that's the key. Imagine if we all look the same you know sometimes I feel like maybe there should be 10 of Mike's out here you know and maybe we would be a pretty good world right but then again maybe you wouldn't and so you know biodiversity is the key because you know when you have a monocrop for example if you were to get one one disease on that particular crop that could wipe out the whole crop whereas these type of biodiversity genetic only genetic engineered through natural selection in our people were able to survive things like diseases droughts and things like that and I'll show you an example on that. So this is what I kind of wanted to compare so I'm looking at one time I looked at the difference between GMO seeds genetically modified orgasms and then I looked at organisms saw organisms and then I looked at Hopi seeds you know and so look how vital the Hopi seeds are and under the same conditions. There's a comparison here why is it like this why are these Hopi seeds out doing these you know genetically modified organisms there we go I'm gonna say GMO how about that and so and so let's look at that way so that's kind of neat you know and I always say because we plant our we plant our seeds in the community nobody likes to be raised alone like over there you know and I'll describe our and I'll describe our system and how we plant like that. So the importance of place-based seeds I think that's one of the things that people misconstrue you know because the Hopis and other tribes have drought intolerance seeds they think that I could take my seeds plant them in Iowa plant them in South America Africa wherever and they think they're going to have the same effect but that's not true because these seeds are conditioned to the place that they were raised at Hopi we've had over 3 000 years of planting this particular varieties and we do not irrigate that kind of stumbles people's minds because when I was at Cornell University as an undergrad the agronomist and the crop scientist said I need 33 inches of rainfall a year to have corn and we only we could raise ours in only six to ten years to have a plant that's amazing you know why because that's in a testimony to our indigenous ingenuity so drought tolerance so this is this was taken in this was taken in July look how dry that ground is but look at that plant that's an example of drought tolerance you know and there's a number of factors and I'll kind of explain some of the techniques you know and I'll tell you where they came from but this is kind of neat this is a totally different type of agriculture you know this is community type based agriculture with a big big hunk of culture and spiritual values placed behind it these aren't commodities these are actual living human beings so you see a cluster of people that's a community to us and I'll describe that as I go down the road here so what can we learn from indigenous societies how can we able to survive what can we learn from people like myself and other people what can we learn first of all you know a lot of my information comes from these three books the footprints of Hopi history which actually has a DNA analysis in it the Hopi people which has a some photographs of agriculture and things like this and this last book right here is a good book becoming Hopi a history that was produced a lot by our Hopi cultural preservation office so a lot of this information that I have is but a lot of the information that I have is from my is from my relatives and other people out there who asked me you know when I talk this to credit them because you know they said if I do this myself that the Hopi cultural preservation office might get a little upset about that but I've got my thing so the Hopi cultural preservation office helping and help to write all those books so this is what I'm talking about indigenous resilience is based on relationships values and cultural belief systems so here I go what makes us survive this is a petroglyph below old eriaby and this is our pathway to sustainability that's how it was interpreted that's how I was told it was you know each each clan and each and each thing that we have out here a clan's like an extended family has their own version of it but this is the one that I was told what this is telling us that this is telling us that this is the world that we're living in today this is there's two paths that go this way down here this way and then you'll see a bunch of these stick figures holding their hands you know and then you'll see a gentleman right here hunched over with this with this with this with this planting stick going through his field of corn and this is important in context because corn to us is like our mother we were farmers from the beginning and so that's how culturally important to us there are several things in Hopi society that remind us of that and the importance of that for one of them would be one of our baby naming ceremonies where that child is raised to the sun after two to three weeks placed a small little piece of Hopi sweet corn putting into their mouth so that grounds them where they're from we also use it to make we also use it for prayer meal also in other and other devices we just don't eat it it has contextual meaning to a lot of things it's what's it's wrapped around it and I make this argument that when you look at that 80 percent that's up there and you look at where those where those indigenous people are located they all have a belief system and cultural relevancy to tie them and give them the discipline that they need not to over exploit or extract their natural resources that's one of the main points but so back to the but to the petroglyph here so what this is telling us what this is telling us is that in today's society because this kind of represents the fourth world there were three others you can read about that in in Frank Waters book and some of them that they talk about this but this is the world that we believe in we believe are in and we see a bunch of us going up this way now this path what I would call represents modernity you know that's a word that I learned when I was getting my master's in a philosophy class modernity what it means to me is complications and so this is these are all complications that we face all the challenges and stuff that we face down below this gentleman is practicing his agriculture he's doing his agriculture remember how important that is and so what happens and what this is telling us is that as long as we've continued to believe in our in our traditions and our customs and our culture we'll continue on until the next world see that line never ends it just goes on what this is also telling us is that this is us right now we have a chance to go back to what I call our values we have that chance we don't talk about values too much even even even at even in school I'm a scientist but you know when I start bringing in values people frown upon that well how can you prove it how can you quantify it and I always say well I'm here I have proof of concept you know our survival is based upon our proof of concept so this relationship with nature let me highlight that when I talk about this relationship with nature I can talk about it but unless I show this you can't really might not be able to understand this but this relationship is then dependent upon us working with each other not just with the human the human to human relationship but the human to the world relationship in fact and so when I was building my stone house up here on the reservation up here above my fields out of stone this little bird was building under here and he was built his nest out of stone and I couldn't figure out for the longest time who was teaching who you know when you look at it from that concept and you give yourself enough time to slow down and some people say pick the roses you know I like to watch a little ant cross the road you know you really can understand what relationships is really about so also when I talk about this belief system this is our typical Hopi agricultural calendar the word Mouya is Hopi it means moon and Hopi but these are the different things that we do during our whole agricultural season if you notice right here in the middle let's call you Kyawomi month which December you'll notice this is a little mouse right here what does that little mouse mean somebody said hantavirus but it really doesn't mean that it really means that's the time for us to tell stories that's the time for us to reinforce our culture December out Hopi is kind of a dark month for us and so it's time for us to reinforce what we've been talking about so that we can teach the next generation very important stories are very important they're not just made up things but they actually and have stories to keep us on the right road so this environment and relationships to the stabilization the community when I'm talking about you know this relationship this survival that we have when I look at this particular pictures right here 1915 1901 2015 2015 the same crop the system hasn't changed in at least that for a hundred years shock and it hasn't changed probably since the last three thousand years it's always worked and why has it worked because we've adapted to that place for a long time those techniques and everything like that work when I work for the natural resource conservation service they asked me to you know put cover crops in there or do something this or do something like that and I said that's not going to work nobody's going to buy into that you know so it's kind of hard for another corn like a person a farmer in Iowa to tell me how to plant corn because we've been doing it for such a long time not only corn but beans squash melons things that you think would need a lot of water but we can do without that and I can explain that as I go so hope is one of the few places I know where corn is raised to fit the environment and the environment is not manipulated to fit the corn so what does that mean that goes back to play space that goes back to our survival and our capabilities you know without irrigation we don't irrigate we don't use pesticides herbicides a lot of our crops are managed by hand now we can do that because a lot of our fields are only one to five acres so we can get out there and do that and so it's very important so to me it's like working with the environment giving taking what the environment gives you and then some finding some way to give it back so indigenous place based management techniques so let me talk about some of these techniques so we're always talking about you know regenerative regenerative movement right now and bringing in and bringing in new pesticides and herbicides but if you look at this picture right here I'm planting in the area where it's conducive to catching monsoon rent off but look at that new soil in there so I do not have to rotate my crops year in and year out I have a field that's 75 years old it still has a pH level about 8.8 on it and that's just growing continuous corn I challenge somebody in the United States any farm in the United States for 75 year field level same pH levels if they have not used those those phosphorus and everything else that goes with that it's kind of neat so food security we're always talking about that so what is our survival in food security here's another example of indigenous ingenuity this is a corn roast that we have using our own sweet corn and and I kid you not we harvest this because it's not waterlogged we harvest it we bake it in a pit and we bring it back out and I've had corn that's 40 years old after it's dried out I just put water on it we'll sit it soak for half a day and boil it back up just pops right back up that's food security it's not how many Walmarts or Circle K's you have it's you know for me it's how many corn roasting pits you have right that's real food security makes a lot of sense like that so the benefits of indigenous farming now this is the important part of it first of all it helps reduce obesity you know a lot of a lot of people you know we have that big problem out there on most reservations uh that's that's plaguing us it reinforces family culture it stabilizes families environmentally friendly it increases the concept of sharing but most important is you learn to have a real respect for the land and what it provides by doing this time in and time out and that starts with the youth educating the youth and I'll talk about that so redefining western associated constructs so how can we create opportunities for indigenous people to be far first of all we got to redefine the language you know we got to redefine the language we got to we got to make it more conducive to to our way of thinking you know the regenerative agriculture movements is a good one I like it it brings back soils it makes sure they have the mineral contents in it I like it they're giving a lot of credit to indigenous people just like permaculture but their definition is so sterile why is that so because in this definition it does not mention something that I came up with and I'm a PhD so I can put my own definition in there by darn it and so you know so in here I talk about I talk about indigenous place-based ways of knowing and land use management schemes adapted for survival this is the important part which are supported by cultural belief systems and community in corporate over a millennia that is regenerative agriculture in a nutshell because we have that belief system that gives us a discipline we need not to over utilize our lands that we're from and that's important for our survival the other thing is when we look at the heart of evaluation you know there's a lot of non-profits trying to help but they're always wanting numbers they always want numbers to quantify things so I'm coming up with a different method to look at what does the community need you know this is this is their matrix in this one particular community the key indicators of wellness are connection to the community connection to Zuni culture sense of belonging intergenerational relationships level enjoyment confidence in practicing healthy traditions it's a whole different matrix than how many people have been served you know what's the person's blood pressure you know this is all about community and I think that's something that we all need to focus on more is community we all need to help each other a lot of my work is very collaborative and I'll explain that so redefinition calls for the re-evaluation of our social norms this is our indigenous value system this is this is windbreaks placed on my field when I look at this picture over here this is windbreaks placed on an agricultural field down here and to protect cattle what is the difference first of all this is dependent upon our survival we do this for survival as a society in our community this one is more for economic gain well I have to ask our squalls do we really want to be do we want to really help communities or do we really want to help economics can we have both you know I believe we can but I think we have to look at that so this is a typical you know agricultural windbreak at Hopi but the funny thing about this is that this system the natural resource conservation service at the time would not give us funding for for this type of system they would give us type for this type of system why was that because this type of system has not been scientifically validated despite 10 000 or 3 000 years of replication it hasn't been scientifically validated according to the scientists at NRCS so therefore we miss out but we're still here so we haven't missed out that much and so you know what I'm talking about and also what I'm also looking at guys is trying to relieve the the status quo of indigenous people being looked at as victims I certainly don't want to be a victim but what causes us to be victims well if you look at how the economic mindset is set up on gross domestic product these are all related to that first or third world countries low-income countries developing nations global north and south that's how come we're stuck in the way we are now what if we were to say let's call these territory territories high biodiversity territories versus low biodiversity territories and because we sit on 80 percent of biodiversity where do you think we'll be at on the plane right at the top right so we won't be talking from a prospect of victimhood but we'll be talking from a prospect of resiliency and that's important so indigenous recognition is achieved through native science demonstration projects now these are some of the projects that I got going on right now why is that important because people want to have science they want to have data you know and so I'm starting to do that I'm starting to show yes this works you know this works this is a project that I got going on at Arcosanta you probably read about in the paper a few months ago but I have grow outs over here why am I doing this why am I growing these out because I'm trying to increase the seed supply of these particular drought variety strains to take them home and give them to my community so I can incentivize more of our tribal members to do that because that's so important because we want to be like that little guy on the picture up there who's going on that road that's going to go into the next world and not be going up that crazy path of modernity so when I talk about indigenous ingenuity I look at some of this cost effectiveness of this this is not that much but look at this so I've got a deep role planter you know people are very surprised that I put corn down at least corn anywhere from 6 to 18 inches deep depends upon what I see in the in the in the springtime and I'm able to gauge our soil moisture not by something that the U of A gives me called a soil moisture probe I look at the chipper typical different types of plants out there I look at their and they all have different rooting systems and the ones who are the shallowest if I see a lot of those plants have shallow root systems I know my soil moisture levels up pretty good I'm going to have a good year and I've been I've been down there where I've had my soil moisture like way down and nothing was growing and I still planted anyway and why did I plant anyway because I was told a long time ago to have faith in everything I do faith in everything I do so that's what it is but so then you have a stray blade cultivator rather than your typical mowerboard plow we're taking some of this early introduced industrialization and tailoring it to our needs out there so this particular cultivator only takes off about two inches of the top soil and just cuts the weeds like a modern hoe and so we don't lose our soil moisture and this thing right here is is what I call cost effective you can put this on the back of a three-wheeled ATV and drag it around you don't need a fifty thousand dollar tractor put it on ATV do the same thing you know that's saving money because I think a lot of people to understand is that we have a very limited amount of revenue out there on most Indian reservations and so when you introduce something out there you got to make sure that people first of all they can afford it and also they need to know how to work it if it breaks down and so that's important that's all about our survival but to me survival is always about adaptation if the city of Tucson were to become flooded would you be able to adapt or if the stores got empty would you be able to adapt you know or would everybody come to my house like on um like on that baseball movie where I see a big line of lights coming up the road or something like that feel the dreams you know maybe so maybe not that'd be kind of scary but you're always welcome I always tell her I was welcome in my house you know and so when I'm talking about redigionous you know recognition of indigenous knowledge just passed in 2021 the white house and the office of science technology policy finally said that traditional ecological knowledge as it's coined scientifically and what I like to call simply the things my grandfather taught me you know uh it was it was passed by the white house so now we're able to start to tap into some of this conservation funding where we had to first of all try to prove that it was scientific now they're saying it is science so we don't have to do that as much but we still got to have methods in order to help validate that so that you know we can buy into these federal conservation programs so what what are the barriers that still exist now don't get kind of sad because this is kind of tough to look at and so some of it the main one here is land tenure and security what does that mean why do you think that we're in a situation that we're in the situation a lot of reservations just don't have the funds are you know we have the highest rates of of of of poverty out there I think it's 88 percent 80 percent of people on the pine ridge reservation don't have jobs you know and things like that why is that you know because of land tenure and security people we have the right to occupancy in the united states but we do not have the right to tithe tithe and if you don't have the right to tithe your land's worth nothing you can't even get it you can't even get a bank loan so we have to fix this it's going to take congressional action to fix this I can't fix it and so this lack of natural resource data if you look at the data that we need to take advantage of federal conservation programs we just don't have it if you look at noah for example if you overlay their weather map on top of our reservation boundaries you won't see hardly any of those out there makes no sense and also the lack of financial capital that's always a problem but that a lot of that stems from this land and it's in security but that is not only a problem here in the united states that is a problem throughout the globe that's a direct result of what I call the the colonization stuff and things like that but that's what happens so solutions presented but not enforced there's the other thing we have all these things up in here alternative funding arrangements uh Indian agriculture resource management act lack of indigenous participation in the digital amazing process are some of the barriers but but they're not really barriers because they're there right but if for example the Indian agriculture resource management act of 1993 allows us to take over conservation programs and produces scholarships for Indian kids who want to go to college in agriculture but it's never been funded you know I used to work for congress and so when I when you have a bill if it's even if it has legislation if it doesn't have funding behind it it just sits there you know so the solutions are here guys but they need to be reinforced they need to be reinforced in order for us to have full access to what's out there you know and I think you know what's his name Russell means said this one time at the at the Indian affairs committee meeting a long time ago in 1985 he says that you know in this great country of ours we call the united states American Indians are allowed to do everything except be American Indian think about that you know that's kind of those are kind of harsh words but it makes a little bit of sense because of our practices and our laws and policies we need to change to create true equity so upscaling for now when everybody likes to use upscaling but for me upscaling is should only be used for the benefits of community that can be accomplished when it truly meets the needs of the community and not the needs of the corporations that makes sense like that you know for my example people say why don't you go out and raise Hopi corn everywhere make a lot of money somebody called they said how can we make your traditional foods more vogue you know when you talk to native chefs some of them have actually quit because they're catering to that niche out there and their own people aren't eating as good as other people are paying a hundred dollars a plate so they're starting to feel conscious about that so we need to level the playing field a little bit this is some of the stuff I do here is going to do that so when you look at travel in food security all these dark spots are almost all on our reservations it's not that good out there right that's not that good out there but you know so how can we do this what are the community-based solutions and collaborations that we can do so now we can get happy again now that we got all the bad stuff out of the way so how can we how can we help with this first of all you know what what I'm doing right now is you're working for extension is you know this continuance of environment and culture knowledge for the next generation so I'm able to take kids like these young kids out there take them to my field talk about science like agronomists botanists because we do all that thing and hydrologists you know but I'm also also talking about the importance of culture the name driver of why we were still here you know and so sure enough by the end of the day when I'm talking I says what does everybody want to be they don't say a fireman a policeman they say I want to be hydrologist I want to be an agronomist Mike you know and that's so cool you know because they're learning that at a young age right I've got something right now I'm going to work with the school board in the city of Tucson where I want to make sure that every child in head start has a cup has seeds has soil and some water to plant with on their first day why is that important first of all it shows them that relationship it understand they understand where things are coming from and the last thing it puts a smile on a child's face isn't that cool you know so I'm going to be talking to the school board and we'll see how that goes and we'll see how that goes but I hope it works out you know out of out of the 83 out of the 83 schools here we have in Tucson and Moses Moses over there at the at the school garden program we have we have gardens and 71 of them you know so that's pretty good for for down here in Arizona so this revitalization of the American food system I just started a non-profit called the Fred Aptivy Foundation named after my grandfather because my grandfather would help everybody we had these conferences in Prescott he'd make sure everybody was fed you know so I wanted to do that something but this is going to solely focus on growing out traditional varieties at Hopi possibly put in a food bank we actually have a food hub up there right now during the COVID period for example you know we had St. Mary's food truck come over there but they would go back half full with perishable items because we had no place to store it and I don't know if you ever to places like when these big things come in they give you a 60 pound back of of green peppers potatoes 60 pounds that's a lot of food we where you going to put that at you know and so you know but we could have held on to that food and slowly distribute it out the community but a lot of it came back and that's unfortunate so I'm trying to fix that and so also the Native American agricultural fund we when I was there we put together this beautiful infrastructure map what will be needed in Indian country to help us out food processing centers you know food hubs places to to have things growing out more and everything in there it's a beautiful plan and more people are looking at that now you know three billion dollars that's all it costs three billion dollars over 10 years to get Indian country where it needs to be not only is it going to help them the Indians but it's also going to help the non-Indians when you put these food hubs in because people have places to go during COVID for example in Oklahoma a lot of people couldn't find a way to get a shot so a lot of them so the reservations took them into their own IH Indian Health Service hospital and gave them shots there so we're still willing to help but how many people are willing to listen you know and so that's that's where I'm at on that one so some of the current stuff that I'm working on I'm developing a process to make sure Indigenous communities can benefit from research related to seeds I have something at the university right now which you basically have them look at look at seeds as human subjects so when you do a test and you research on that the communities will benefit where those seeds came from they'll get some benefit of that it's important also the intellectual property I'm trying what I'm trying to do is put seeds under the NAGPRA under the Native American Game Repatriation Act so that we can so that we can declare intellectual property values things like that's important growing out seeds and I talked about that nutritional analysis because everything we have to do has to have a nutritional analysis believe it or not when you want to do these food to food to table pro farm to table programs you have to have a analysis in order to get those foods in there and also this mitigation risk I'm doing some grow outs here at the University of Arizona looking at the different water methods to increase the amount of Indigenous agriculture but I want you to make a stark look at this and you see there's economics is not involved in this there's no word economics mentioned in this at all because I don't need that I'm just trying to maintain the health of our communities out here does that make sense a little bit you know so that's part of our survival I'm trying to do everything I can to bring this to the forefront so people can understand that now what does this have to do with archaeology it has a lot to do with archaeology because you know we've experienced these things before and we're just trying to find new ways to adapt and to conserve what we have in the long run so this community versus economics so that's kind of last thing I wanted to talk about so when we when we leave here we got to ask ourselves you know are we looking at our community are we still looking at economics or can we have both you know I really don't know if we can have both I think we can I've seen it but you know for me it's all about community first it's about taking care of something that I was given that I'm only passing knowledge on that I have to benefit everybody else it's creating opportunities for others you know I went to school I got my PhD and my dad says now you have more responsibility because now you have an obligation to help more people and that's important to me and so that's why I'm here and so thank you very much Could you tell us a little bit a little bit more about soil pH I know zero about it Okay well soil pH you know there's a thing called phosphorus potassium and nitrogen and so the pH levels have the acidity in there to to to that that that the plants and take up in order for them to actually prosper and so like for example corn takes a tremendous amount of nitrogen and so you have to have those pH levels just right and it's kind of a combination of everything to make sure that you're going to have a good crop and that's what we do a lot of we try to find ways to to make sure that we have the quantity and it's efficient and everything like that but unfortunately you know one of our number one problems here is that is agricultural runoff that's one of our biggest problems and that's due to all that stuff that they're putting on there to make those those plants look pretty and things like that and so that's kind of what pH does it's just it's just it's just it's a it's a term that we're trying to put into your soil so that it's balanced enough so that you can have good crops I'm curious about your work at Arcosanti and if you're able to talk about that at all what you're doing there Yeah I've been I've been growing there for about two years now there used to be a family of Hopis growing there long before that and so what I'm trying to do is I'm taking a couple of varieties at a time and I'm growing them out down there so that we can so I can bring those seeds back home and distribute to the communities see they have water down there see they have an unlimited amount supply of water where you can do drip irrigation and things like that at Hopi we don't have that but what I'm also being very careful of is that I'm making sure that you know we only we only have two years at the most of drip irrigation two years of flood irrigation because I do not want to use the dry vitality of our plants not only our corn but our beans our melons and our squash because you got to understand that it's it's it's hard to raise things in the desert we don't always get a crop we don't always do that but we're what we're losing our seeds pretty continuously and so I'm trying to bring back those varieties in a way that we can all benefit you know as a people because those those those varieties that we raise are very nutritionally dense because we don't use any of those things and so they're taking up what what the earth is giving us you know so that relationship continues so thank you this is all very interesting and I'm just curious so you have 75 acres and I'm just curious if you're gonna kind of like where does your crop go who do you give it to how does it get to your community does it get beyond the community I guess it does well no I have one to five acres and so you know a lot of a lot of a lot of our distribution mechanism is is is the women are in charge of that that's one thing I should always mention is that we live in a matrilineal society so it's the women who get the harvest when it comes off the field they go out and look at the different traits on that to to save seeds for the next year you know they're also they also own the fields the women own the fields the house and everything and so I'm just kind of like Shrek out there I just move things around and so but but they're very important so you know that's that's how it's distributed so basically it's distributed to the family and then the clan and so forth and it kind of goes out that way it's a pretty good food system but we just need the quantities to increase to distribute more of those good quality products can you talk a little bit about the land tenure problem because I was interpreting that for you to say that individuals need to be able to own land but I don't think that's what you're saying no no it's it's it's basically it's basically there's no title that means like if you have a if you own a house and you own the area around that that's yours that belongs to you you can pretty much do whatever you want to depends upon where you live but with with but with on indian lands you cannot do that you know you have to go to the bureau of indian affairs or the bureau of land management in order to sign things like leases things like that so you don't have control of it you just can't go sell it you know and it was it was started that way because unfortunately there were people coming in and they were just taking the land and things like that I don't know if you've seen that old sage movie called the call or whatever called the wildflower you know it's kind of like that and so you know we don't have real title to it so we're we can't put anything up for collateral you know when we want to make an investment you know some of the tribes around here they've did a pretty good job you know investing their stuff you know with with all the businesses they have that are used that are close to these huge popular centers so they're doing okay but the ones that are way out there big land braces like the Navajo Nation and things like that we just don't have that we're dependent upon the federal government you know I mean for example the recent supreme court case that was Arizona versus the Navajo Nation when it talked about water access to water they're they said yeah you have your water rights but we're no longer going to be responsible for doing feasibility studies providing infrastructure you know because of that ruling and so what do we do then you know we don't have the capital anyway we don't have that you know and that's that's unfortunate but and I don't know how we can do that but we're held in trust by the federal government they're like our big brother to some extent they have a responsibility and so but at the same time we're trying to find ways so that we can chuck some of that stuff and I think one of our big ways to show that is through our food systems trying to reinvent that to to create the independency that we need rather the dependency that we currently have so that's kind of what that's what it means like land tenure we just don't have the rights to title and that's throughout the globe hey uh with all your travels throughout uh North America and stuff abroad what are some of the successes or challenges that you've seen or that maybe we can take back or share with them well one of the biggest challenges that I see even I spoke at cop 28 a couple times and I listened to what was going on over there you know the people are still aren't willing to give up their fossil fuels but that's not the biggest things people aren't are afraid to give up their power you know that that bothers me a lot but then I see on the other side of that I see a little bit more and you know indigenous people be involved in some of the discussions now where they weren't before you know because science is looking for an answer they're looking for ways to kind of balance it out a little bit and so are the people who are these with these big corporations are but and so that gives me help you know when I start seeing things like you know how are we gonna how are we gonna bring in uh tribal data sovereignty how we're gonna keep what we find out there and make sure that the tribes benefit they're starting to do that now because they have to because their survival even their survival depends upon that you know because all the genetic diversity basically in my mind is out on these a lot of out on these indigenous territories so they're starting to ask some questions now they're trying to do that and it's not only it but it's not necessarily the travel government but it's also the non-profit organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation you know they're making big headway into that kind of stuff too and and even our university is doing you know this year this year I was able to keep you know ask the university because we're a land-grant institution we have a pretty pretty not so good history but I was able to have the rather just the land knowledgement I was able to to have them click on something now that would show how the University of Arizona was came into play and the land that it came from and what the benefits were just so just for transparency you know I think that's one of our main things and that's one thing that gives me hope is that we're starting to see that transparency not only how things were done but how we can help move things forward in an equitable fashion the pictures you showed for Hopeview were mostly like dry farms and I remember visiting many years ago and seeing these spectacular spring fed gardens and I was just wondering whether that was part of the program and part of the solution as well oh yes it is because you know like in Hopeville they have a good one even at Weepo Wash they're starting to the tribe and the cultural preservation office are starting to move and starting to clean out some of those old springs and things like that and so that is a big part of it too you know I mean so we're starting to move in that direction too but and you know down in lower Munkapede there in Tuba City we people still do irrigate there to some extent and things like that so that's still going on in adversity but most of the reservations still relies upon dry farming it's a little harder now because you know back in the introduction of cattle we had three major washes that would slice through the reservation but when cattle came out there they started over grazing and those auroras just got deeper and deeper and deeper so they're not utilized like they like they were at one time back when we saw a writing from there was a book published by the U of A Press that talked about the abundancy of Hopi crops during like when the Spanish came out of here and the priests were saying we can't take any more food we've got so much of it you know and even my grandfather back in his day he remembers when the grass used to be up to the horse's belly and how how fertile that soil was but it's not like that anymore because of those cut downs right now but I'm just trying to figure out little niches that I can use to help us benefit from that but but water like that's very important for us and water isn't really looked at as a commodity it's looked at almost like a spiritual force so it's very valued and I always like to say people we do a lot with less than we do with more and I think that's important those values are very important so that's kind of how I would address that question but thanks for asking that I'm curious as to whether or not this is something that is unique to the Hopi people or do similar practices and agricultural procedures or whatever processes exist for other reservations around the country and how can we I don't promote these kinds of things across across the country well well the non-irrigated agriculture is is real specific to Hopi but it's also specific to Navajo too because they they're in the same area back when Mesa Verde and Chaco Canyon were populated that was dry farming there too there wasn't that much going on in there but but nowadays it's it's really it's a lot of these examples come from Hopi you know there's places in Africa that have similar that had similar practices but a lot of them have been erased because of the new cropping systems that come in and same thing with Indian to some extenses and so it's just it's just a little harder to to do that anymore I mean for me you know when they talk about dry irrigation they set up in Oregon they do dry irrigation but they that means that that means they don't flood irrigate but they have 33 something inches of rainfall a year you know and so that's not dry that's not dry farming to me six to ten inches is dry farming to me I mean down here I've got friends down here in T.O. they actually still plant the traditional way they don't put their seeds in until July in dry soil and they put there's paddocks that are formed and they're on little slopes they know where the slopes are at so when it does hit a blonde suit boom it pops up and then you have things like 60 day corn you can get a crop in 60 days you know corn in America usually it goes by growing degree days the most of the corn that we in the supermarkets 120 degree growing degree days 140 growing degree it takes that long to actually produce a crop that's a fast growing corn down there you know my concern is is that we need to figure out how to keep this genetic information in the hands where it comes from because you have people like Bayer now who basically have a short variety of corn where they got that gene from I don't know if they're going to use it to spread out the world to say this this does pretty good well I could have told them that for a long time and of course it does good you know but we're not getting any benefit from that you know and so we're trying to figure out ways well how can we show that and that's part of that's part of trying to create our own patents and our own ways of doing things but we've got to educate our young people to do it ourselves we can't rely upon a federal system or our research system to do that for us we need to learn these things as we go and so we're still catching up so to speak but yeah hi I'm thank you for the presentation I'm from Hiller River and I saw one of your powerpoint or one of the slides talk about the natural conservation system and it's true what you said about the leases for tribal nations it takes us forever to get them from the bureau of Indian affairs and how that goes but one of the things I hope you could advocate for from the NCRS or how natural you know natural resource conservation serves yeah they they ask that tribes or small land farmers they need to have two years in production in order to get funded I'm just sharing that as those are some of the challenges tribes have that we would like to go into production faster however those policies really stump us from going any faster well it's like that there's a there's an irrigation rule out there it says you have to have at least five years of irrigation now I take a bucket to my bean plants of just water that's irrigation but it's not irrigation to the to the western model of things and so we need to figure out ways to to do that and I've been telling I have a meeting with NRCS tomorrow and up in Denver Denver to talk about these issues once again I wrote a paper on it and it's up to them to do something about that you know and you know I apply you know like Ramona farms over there in Gila River you know they grow a lot of temporary beans but they have to pay for that specialized crop out of their cotton enough alfalfa the government needs to be switch things around and give subsidies for small and traditional crops like that also the reservations in southern Arizona think to put at least an acre away that would be good for like indigenous foods to give to our communities that's the other problem we're trying to get them to do that also we have the infrastructure there already but but what I'm doing here at the U of A is just to is to look at the water management principles so I can give them the best technology and that they can do it rather than just give them something and just let it sit there you know and so there's a lot of that there's a lot of that hands-on stuff and so you're welcome my question is and it might be a long one but what makes you feel so confident that economics and agriculture cannot prosper together well it's that it's not that I don't I feel that they can't prosper together it's it's how that's how they're working on it you know I I have a I have a thing that if that if we weren't so the market system gears is geared for one thing it won't work this way it's it's it's if it's based upon quantity and efficiency because by doing that you're cutting a lot of people out you know there's a lot of smart farmers across America who could benefit what they call CSA's community uh forgot what that stands for but they're a bunch of people get together they make a rolls happen it's like a co-op you know if we had a lot more looking at quality a lot of these people to produce quality products like like farmer frank and things like that and so if we're able to have more of that then the people would benefit for more from it economically because economics from what I understand is all based upon supply and demand and so we need to figure out ways to do that so that's that's where that's where the connection comes that's the middle road right there but it's hard for people to change their mindset at least at least in the federal government that they need to support these small farmers more than what they're doing to put the quality back into our diet rather than you know the end results of that being high rates of diabetes and cancer and stuff like that we need to focus more on the quality and so that's where I can get on that so when I when I when I bash the economic side of big agriculture I'm just using what I've what I've seen out there and some people say it's efficient but at the same time I don't know if it really is and whose efficiency is it at the end at the end of the day you know that's what kind of questions I have to ask I don't know if I quite answer that question but that's how that's how I see it for our online audience if you haven't yet please type your questions in the Q&A but I have a few here that I will ask Michael if he um one reads the uh they've read they've read that lime makes corn a complete food does Hopi have lime available to them no we don't you know a lot of that stuff is is brought in in what they call luvial flood plans or oxygen farming where we plan in areas that are conducive to bringing new soils and new nutrients into the field so yeah we don't use lime um can you say more about the roasting pit and how it's used for preserving corn well the roasting pit is made out of stone it's stone line you know um it's in the ground about three feet and what and what's practiced is that we once we get the once we get the corn out we use this greasewood at the bottom of this pit to heat it up takes quite a bit time to heat it up and then we drop all that corn in there what that does by sealing it and covering up overnight and bring it out the next day then what it does is kind of acts like a dehydration process it it it takes most of the the the moisture out of it and it seals it in there so all we got to do is take it out of there and hang it up and then we can use it many years later it can last forever that way when it's preserved like that you know and it's preserved like that because we live in such a dry climate right we don't have humidity like back east so we're not really worried about mold or anything like that but by roasting it like that takes care of all those things that can that can really hurt it um what's the ideal ph for corn i believe it's around 8.5 to 8.8 and that ours is about 8.8 right now i mean the least on my field that i tested on that and then i have someone here um from new mexico talking about how the drought really affected their crops um last year and they were asking how yours did and if it was better well mine mine kind of mine kind of you know at hopi we have you know we have a lot of different variables we have cutworms crows you know um sometimes too hot sometimes too cold lack of water you know wind storms you know disease and we have all these things that we have to look at but you know my crop this year um about about a third of it got tanked out by cutworms which are little things that go are in the soil and then they they nod at the bottom of the plant there where the root is and they just the plant just falls over the other thing is that it was real hot this summer and and being not responsible like i should have been i'm supposed to thin that clump of corn out which is about you know we plant anywhere from 10 to 10 to 15 kernels per hole and so i should have thinned them out to at least six to seven when it starts getting warmer because we're all they're all competing for soil moisture and then during even this year i probably should even thin those out to three to four then i would have had a really good crop with years being about so big but i didn't do that and so i lost a lot of my crop to heat stress and the last part of my crop which i had for corn i was gone for 10 days only 10 days and i came back and it looked like you know it looked like someone had just laid my field out it was like little bodies of corn everywhere by the crows and so i didn't get that but this year i've got an agreement with with the school to be out there for those three months between august and the time i harvest so that doesn't happen again i think that's the thing that people don't understand is that you need to be with your crops because you need to take care of your relatives right no one else is going to do it unless you do it yourself because too many things can go wrong so yeah do you know if um if there are any hopi seeds in the national seed storage lab oh yeah there's a bunch in there i mean if you that's called grit i forgot what that stands for but the usda has a bunch of them the problem with that is that we can't get access to them you know researchers and institutions can have access to those we can't even in museums we can't so i'm working on those issues we do have there are seeds in these different organizations whether or not they're true or not they may have came from there but they've been propagated with water so much that when we take seeds back home they don't do well at all because they're needing that extra they're needing all that water to grow like they used to and so it's taken us 3 000 years to get to that dry adaptation and you know you put five or six years or maybe 10 years of flood irrigation on that particular plant it's going to lose its drought mentality there's no way they're going to preserve that and so uh so you know we gotta we gotta keep what we gotta do we gotta also grow them in the places they they were they're growing originally so they can do they can pick up those things you know and i and i kind of you know i'm writing an essay on the importance of seeds and i would almost compare them to kind of like the boarding school kids because you know those kids were taken away they were lost their identity they lost their culture and seeds a lot of our seeds are just like that they don't know where they're at they don't know how to grow anymore and so i'm just trying to bring them home i just want to bring them home so that we can not only enforce our culture but also increase the biodiversity and conservation that we're good at and so that's where i'm at that i have a another question which would be a good one to wrap up the evening but they ask how they can support this work and if they're and other work of indigenous farmers well there's like you know indigenous resilience center we're starting to work in outreach like that but there's my own organizations at home like like the hope you hope you hope the tootskua permaculture the hopey foundation and we also have the hope hopey zuni youth enrichment project there's just a number of organizations out there i wanted to start a podcast here to talk to just focus on native american grassroots food organizations because there's quite a few of them when i used to work for the native american agricultural fund we were helping fund about 300 of them and that was just hitting the type of the tip of the iceberg and so for me to support things is first of all we need to figure out what's going on out there have the awareness but also but also kind of you know do your own research and see what you can find out there there's tons of organizations out there i'm just now getting the big non-profit sector involved more in indian country and a lot of people are helping me do that in order to in order to get the benefits from that out there and so this but it's like everything else you know you don't you don't see that many native american stories on mainstream tv you know and so our our problem is just trying to just get the recognition so rather than looking at equity as i talked about i'm looking at recognition first to get off off the museum walls and into your living rooms and so that's kind of where i'm at on that so thank you so much we have really greatly enjoyed tonight's presentation thank you so much for everyone who came out and for everyone online as well so thank you have a great night and thank you dr johnson thank you
