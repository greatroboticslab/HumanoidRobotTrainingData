 Hi and welcome back to another video. One thing I have personally come to like so much about a solar system is the fact that you can always start small and then go big later. So starting small has to do with the number of solar panels as well as batteries and then other accessories you might need and then you are always able to upgrade data to you know a bigger package or solution. So you could recall that when we were approaching electricity phase like getting electricity for this house and we decided to consider solar we're able to start small that that was starting with two batteries two panels and then added. So in today's video let's talk about the upgrade of our solar system. So as I was saying earlier we started off with solar system with just two batteries that was 100Ah batteries each so that gave us like 200Ah and then also two panels of each that was 180W each so that was 360W of panels that was what we got and then we had the inverter that was 3kVA or 3000W of inverter and there's some few other accessories. Now that particular solution wasn't able to power much as of then it was basically you know to help us test the electrical system that we've had installed and then to use some few power tools. So it was able to power up some few power tools not for a long time you know we had to regulate how we're using those power tools so that we don't run completely out of battery as at then. So that particular solution as you can recall in some of my videos was around 6600 cds plus there about that was what it did cost for that particular solution having the two panels two batteries and then one inverter and then some few other accessories to you know get started with that and then aside from that when we continue working on this house and then you got to a point where we needed more to use more power tools there was the need to upgrade from that particular solution to something higher so that meant that we had to go in for two additional batteries that was 100Ah each and then two more panels and then also some few accessories to help with that particular upgrade. So going about that upgrade also that cost around 9000 plus there about and so we upgraded from 6600 to around 9000 plus there about so we spent like around 3000 plus for that particular upgrade that was for the battery that is two batteries that is 100Ah each and then 180W of panels each. Now during that particular upgrade also going about the upgrade was it was very necessary to take into consideration you know the angle of the sun where the sun comes from where it rises and there is so we ended up installing those two panels on the other side of the building so the first two panels went to this side of the building and then the other two went to this side of the building. The reason was we normally have the sun rises from this place and then set around this place so when it sun rises it takes you know a long time for it to get to this point so as I know even though we're getting good amount of sun energy we're still losing some so I didn't have those two panels over here was able to you know help get you know good amount of energy for the batteries. Now that solution also was given us around 720 watts of panels solution or energy from the solar panels and then also around 400 amp hours from the battery so that was like the energy we were able to get as a dented and that did cost like around was upgraded to around 9000 cities. Now when it got to the point where we were down with the building and we had to move in there was also a need to upgrade but we took time to upgrade to that particular solution or the current solution we have now because as and then the solution we had was able to power up our fridge was able to power up tv water pump and then the lights and then the fan in the house however it wasn't able to power up there that is especially the fridge 24 hours because during the daytime of course the solar panel is able to also supply energy to whatever devices that we are using whenever the sun is up or even during the daylight that we have so that means that we're going to pop our fridge from like early morning from around six o'clock to around four five pm uh get into the evening then we have to turn it off because if we keep it on it means that um some of the energy which would have have to store and use in the evening would have to be cut off so that was how we were regulating that until we got the final upgrade and also during then we were able to pop all the lights outside um the house um yeah throughout the evening until the next morning and we're also not watching so much of telly i'm not really so much of a tv person so that was how we're going about it and then um the water pump we use it as the one we need if we want to get water in the house and there isn't so much pressure from the tank then you just turn power of the um pumping machine and that was mostly during the daytime so we're not using uh the pump during the evening time so that was how we went about uh the second phase of our upgrade we're able to manage situations until we go to the final phase or not necessarily final but to the current stage of our upgrade so the current stage of our upgrade has two 200 ah batteries so instead of additional 100 we added to 200 so that gives us an additional 400 ah 400 um hours so adding it to whatever we had uh what we had earlier that was 400 makes it now 800 amp hours and then we also added two more um panels that is 180 watts of panels so that also gives us a total of 1080 watts of um solar you know energy or energy which is being drawn from the solar panels so as you can see talking about the upgrade especially with regard to the solar panels we've sticked to the same wattage of solar panels so we started 180 watts and all our upgrade has been with 180 watts so so that is an important consideration especially when you have a certain solution of solar system and you want to upgrade it's always advisable recommended to stick to the same size of the panels yeah especially the panels but for the batteries we're able to upgrade from 100 ah to 200 ah this time around now that solution or this current solution that we we have has brought to the total solar cost up to around seven 17 500 so it means that we spend around 8 500 about for this particular solution that was because one of the 100 ah but and 200 ah batteries was selling for like around 2 400 they're about and then you have to buy two more panels and they have to get a rails and then um the other accessories that we needed and then the mc4 connectors and then the cables and so on so that brought a total um upgrade to like around that um amount and the current upgrade we have is able to take almost everything that we have in the house so the fridge is now able to power up 24 hours without any challenges we don't have to turn it off at any point i'm able to use power 2 so you saw me do some diy works here um with the first few racks i was using my power 2 that was the um grinding machine using it as a sample machine and then i even have worked on another diy project which is like a small dining table which i'll share with you later and i was able to use a circular saw as well which takes consumes about 1200 watts of energy so i was able to use that throughout the entire project and be able to use our pump we're able to use our ion we're able to turn on the lights we're able to use fans yeah so everything we have in the house the current solution that we have is able to uh pop everything so like i'm saying this has only been possible because of the solar system and we started small we upgraded to a certain point and now we've upgraded to what we have now if in future there's the need to upgrade it's still going to be easier because we are able to add up more panels to it as well as add a battery to whatever we have now also adding up there two more panels to our solar system we had to add it to this particular point where the sun rises from so it's able to draw much energy as compared to where the sun sets or you know um yeah from the middle point to where the sun sits so basically that's the current solar system that we have um the total cost is around 17 500 cities for six panels um four batteries no six batteries so four of them are 100 each and two of them are 200 each so another important consideration also especially with the solar upgrade was that um the outside lights that we had that was a lead light outside as of then was 50 watt each so that means that uh when we turn on all the lights that was like around 200 watts and that was a lot so there was a need to also change those ones to something which was a little lower so currently what we have each of them are um 10 watts each so that gives us a total of like 40 watts so 200 watts to 40 watts that's okay and the brightness is not so like not so bad especially what we have like the brightness is very very okay in the evening so that is also an important question we needed to take um into action so we don't consume so much of the energy that we have you know solar energy is a little bit limited it's not unlimited as compared to maybe um the the grid living the grid is also limited at some point but um you only feel that when it gets to a crucial point when there has to be load shedding so that also is an important consideration we had to take um into action especially with the outside lights also one of the reasons why the cost has increased a little bit was because um of changing prices as at you know this dollar situation that we've had for some time now or inflation so prices of goods has you know gone up so much high the amount we bought the first panels the first set of panels for we didn't get the same amount for the second set of panels and even the last set of panels also was um different prices the same with the batteries the amount you got the two batch the first two batteries was different from the second set of batteries and then also the final set of batteries also was um different and then with the cables the mc4 connectors and everything so in as much as it might look a little bit expensive because we have done this over like a period it hasn't been so expensive and at least it's it's been worth it i must say because we've been here now like officially three months now and if we were supposed to be paying electricity bill asana we would have had to spend like around 600 or a close to 800 cities for electricity based on the things that we have um here so that is not so but i believe that probably in some few years to come it's really going to pay off um and i'm even sure there's going to be some increment to electricity or utility times so yeah the solar system so far has been good all we just need is just energy from the sun or daylight and we are good to go so i've also been nominated for the ut creators awards in the category of um real estate now the awards is happening sometime in november so i'm going to leave a link in the description so you can kindly try to vote for me thank you very much so that would be just about it for this particular video maybe you might have some questions or things that you which was not so clear you can just leave them in the comment section and i'll try as much as possible to respond to them so that would be just about it for this video thank you very much for watching bye for now
