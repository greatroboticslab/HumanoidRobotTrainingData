Science & Technology
 It's actually a series of satellites in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey. And we have more than 50 years of records of this. And it can tell you where there are trees, where there are crops. And we've worked with people like the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify which crops. You can tell from space what's growing by when it greens, the precise color that it is. We can also, we have other satellites that can tell us about plant health. So we have one instrument on the International Space Station called EcoStress that it measures temperature, this really, really high precision. And what it turns out you can learn from that is when plants are water stressed. So when plants don't have enough water, they get a little bit hotter. So they get a fever. And we can see that from space.
