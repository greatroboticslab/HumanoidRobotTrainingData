 Hello everyone. Welcome back to Modern Agri Machines. Today we are going to explore a modern farming model that is becoming increasingly popular and highly effective, growing melons and greenhouses. Not only does this model bring high productivity, but it also protects crops from external environmental factors and optimizes growing conditions. Let's dive right in. Growing melons in greenhouses has several major advantages compared to open field cultivation. Firstly, greenhouses protect plants from extreme weather conditions like heavy rain, scorching heat, or frost, ensuring consistent quality and yield throughout the year, independent of weather conditions. Furthermore, the greenhouse environment is closely controlled. Temperature, humidity, and irrigation are optimized for the plant's growth. As a result, melons grown in greenhouses are often of higher quality with evenly ripened, sweeter fruits. This model also minimizes the intrusion of pests and diseases, reducing the need for pesticides. Greenhouses allow for efficient water use with automatic drip irrigation systems that conserve natural resources. To get started, we first need to construct a greenhouse. The design and installation must ensure durability and protection for the plants. Greenhouses are typically built with sturdy steel frames and covered with UV resistant polyethylene film, allowing the plants to absorb sunlight without damage. Ventilation and temperature control systems are also installed to maintain ideal growing conditions for the melons. Once the greenhouse is ready, the next step is preparing the soil and planting seeds. The soil in the greenhouse must be loosened and enriched with nutrients. Farmers plant the melon seeds in rows or pots, spaced 30-50 centimeters apart, giving each plant room to thrive. Irrigation is done through a drip system, ensuring each plant receives the right amount of water and nutrients without waste. Additionally, LED lighting systems can be installed to supplement sunlight, especially during cloudy days.한 social programming yang makes children can eat ранее indол grand espacio, buscar activites since,geringавливая kolomal plant, encouragingいい plant state of bloom. to flower, they carry pollen from male flowers to female flowers. In greenhouse farming, farmers often use manual pollination methods using small brushes to transfer the pollen or they raise honeybees within the greenhouse to ensure efficient pollination. This helps the cucumber plants produce even fruits and achieve high yields. During the growing process, farmers regularly check the plants, prune leaves and side branches to focus nutrients on the fruits. Organic or bio fertilizers are applied to provide necessary nutrition, ensuring the melons grow evenly and sweetly. Thanks to the enclosed environment of the greenhouse, pest control becomes easier. If any signs of pests or disease appear, farmers can take quick action without needing excessive pesticide use. So the melons are a white-yellow skin. The melons are hand harvested, ensuring minimal damage to the plants and fruits.

They are carefully inspected for xijais, color and shape, and any substandard fruits are removed. The cucumbers are then carefully packed into boxes or bags to protect them during transportation. These packages usually have ventilation holes to keep the cucumbers fresh for a longer period. Once packed, the cucumbers are transported to markets, supermarkets, and distributors for sale. The Greenhouse Mellon Growing model has brought significant economic and environmental benefits. Not only does it increase productivity and product quality, but it also protects crops from weather fluctuations and pests. In the future, with the advancement of technology, growing melons in greenhouses promises to go even further, becoming a sustainable and efficient agricultural solution for farmers.
