 Thank you Brett. Good afternoon everybody. My name is Axel Garcia. Can you hear me there? I am the irrigation specialist. As you can see here we have several trials as regarding irrigation. Most of them are kind of high-tech but we are looking at two ways to provide information to old producers. One is the applied research and the other one is a little bit more basic. The overall objective of these projects are to study drought tolerance, in this case for corn. You might think that we know everything about drought tolerance for corn. But basically what happens is that Wyoming has a really unique environment and it is even much more unique if we come to this part of the state. So it is very dry, really, really very dry. We haven't had rainfall at all. And we wonder what we should do as producers if eventually we don't have enough water at a certain point during the growing season. So we are going to try to respond to those things. The much more practical issue is related to water balance. We want to know how much water the crop uses in this environment. Also we would like to know the water use efficiency of the corn. Well, how do we do that? We do following different methodologies. We use some things that are called crop simulation models to support our field research. We also use what you see there are infrared thermometers. What we do with those equipments are to measure the temperature of the canopy. And actually when the plant is transpiring, we will transpiring the plant cools off is cooler than the temperature of the air so those infrared thermometers are able to measure to determine that temperature in the canopy the information is sent every certain period of time to a station that you can see there in the middle of the experiment and via radio the information is sent directly to our office this work is part of the research of marcelo or rita he is my phd student so so he's going to develop this project during four years he started just now this season this system here is a surface irrigated it's a system that we installed this year and the reason why we are using drip irrigation for corn here is mostly because we need to know exactly the amount of water that we are applying to the crop so by having this system we can do that very easy and if you need to know a little bit more about the specifics of that you should ask marcelo he's the one that is running all the programs in his computer that just comes from time to time to his office and see whether or not everything is okay sometimes actually he corrects me what else as dr has said we have several experiments similar to this one and this is on the surface trip we have another one over there is the sub surface trip and we have a third one far away there in the sprinkler system one of the practical results we've gotten so far is that for example we compared yield of corn produced on the these systems with the flooded one in terms of yield we got pretty much the same but the water use efficiency of these irrigation systems is really very high for the crops is very high and we were able to reduce the amount of water that the crop needs in more than four times i mean 25 percent of the water that we are using uh 25 percent of the water we use uh in uh flooded irrigation is the one we are using here at most so as you can see the crop looks really very healthy and we are expecting this year to have even even a little bit more yield than the other uh irrigation systems uh this is what i have for you in this first stop uh if you have any questions please uh feel free yes sir nitrogen right i don't remember marcelo here was kind of 150 almost pounds per acre 150 pounds per acre yeah any other question have you had any trouble with these hoses clogging up with weeds well it's uh first time and this is on surface uh i don't think we will have problems right now uh it's first year i mean i mean from uh moss and such in the irrigation water no we don't do you know it's from a well yeah it's from a well yeah yeah good point thank you so you might just tell the other trainer what your question excuse me what was the question oh yeah the question was whether or not we have some problems with clogging emitters here due to uh weeds or something like that but the water is a it's a well water so it's no problem so far any other question actual yes is there any plan i certainly water use efficiency is one of the budgets budgets that you're looking at what about the economics of of this system compared to conventional uh mike morris asking about the economics of this as compared to conventional uh we don't have yet of course it's first year but we plan to we plan to to look at that as well thank you sure yes sir so i think the the weather maybe it's uh cold designs natural water is there a difference the well water and the natural water yes the quality mainly to the to the uh course production yes well there is one thing here we don't get rainfall at all hopefully we don't we won't get today but we don't get rainfall at all the corn approximately needs 400 millimeters in the whole season divided by 25 gives you inches here if you do not irrigate you don't produce action yeah but the difference in water rainfall or well water is mainly quite yeah rainfall is much better than than we were the difference i mean the difference the difference is to the production oh production well well where water and no i don't know i don't know but probably there is not a huge difference yes irrigation yes but uh we shouldn't have too much difference the question here is whether or not there are differences in yield with rainfall water or well no no no no natural water natural water natural water yes channel canal water oh canal water okay difference is between uh beach water and uh yeah well water well the main the main difference is quality still yes quality and the temperature of course yes temperature as well
