Science & Technology
 Well good morning everyone. Welcome to the grain storage webinar on hygiene and structural cleanings. My name is Chris Warwick. I'm a consultant based in Horsham, Victoria and I manage the GRDC's grain storage extension project. Now my role in this project has developed over the past 10 years and since the very sad loss of Peter Botter last year and I now service the GRDC's southern region with grain storage workshops and information such as this. As I mentioned, the quick housekeeping, the Q&A window allows you guys to ask questions. A couple of you have worked that out already. Just click on the Q&A to open a window, type your question in the box and click send. If you'd like to send an anonymous question, you can select send anonymously if you don't want to be identified. And please feel free to ask questions as we go. You might have already come with a few questions so feel free to put those in straightaway or as you think of them in order to answer them as we go or at the end. By all means type those questions in. I'd like to thank the BCG for facilitating this session for us today. I appreciate their support and promoting these workshops for us. If you are having any trouble hearing me or can't see the PowerPoint presentation, please let me know why that question was. Rightio, let's get into it. On-farm storage, hygiene and structural treatments. Just as an overview to help us figure out where hygiene and structural treatments fits into the bigger picture of managing on-farm storage. It's really the first step. So if we look at in the whole system, we're really about trying to prevent pests, prevent the infestation of pests, prevent the damage of their grain. If we don't get that right and we still have to do a pest control, then we're looking at phosphine-farm pest control or commercial fumigata. And then lastly, we also want to consider grain quality. So managing moisture and temperature. But in the pest prevention side of things, hygiene and structural treatments along with aeration, cooling, protectants and monitoring, they're about pest prevention. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Pest prevention. Trying to start clean and start with a good fresh storage with no pest contamination. A bit of research to kick things off with. This is some research done by the post harvest research team up in Queensland through the Department of Ag. This is to give you a bit of an idea of how quickly grain destroyed pests can breed up. So we've got months along the bottom. I'll just grab my little tool here. So you can see my mouse. So you can see after three months, this is in a one tonne bulk of bag. After three months, that bulk of bag just left in the shed. We've reached nearly 5,000 beetles. After six months, the numbers really spike up to near that 30,000 mark. So you can see that those few, maybe half bags or bits of grain left lying around throughout the year, often left there for longer than six months, we get a really good understanding of how quickly they become a breeding ground. So that's part of hygiene is to be able to clean those bits of grain up as well. Not just in the solos themselves, but around the sheds and bags of grain left around the place. So for adolescent insects, if you like, how many egg larvae pupae can we actually expect for every one adult? And the research found that for every add of you can find ingrain expect 80 to 90 egg larvae pupae. So it's easy to see how numbers build up quite quickly. So that's why we look at prevention is better than cure. We really don't want to get to the point where we find insects because as we've just seen, they'll breed up really quickly. So that's why we look at it. I'm just going to grab my little spotlight tool again. And hygiene to me, and to what the research shows is really about preventing an unwelcome environment for pests. And what we know is that they like, primarily, they really like shelter. They like to be sheltered from the extreme conditions of the ambient. So they don't like getting really cold. They don't like getting really hot. So somewhere they can shelter from the heat and from the cool. And then secondly, they need a bit of food. So anywhere that you can think of. So loads are the obvious spot. Nice and sheltered little bit of food left in there. Other things around the farms like your seed silos or the chook feed or machinery that's in the shed that might have a little bit of grain residue left in it. All those places are really good harbors for insects. Even consider hoppers and things left around the silos that might be overturned so they don't fill up with water, but actually create a nice little shelter. And if there's a bit of grain left on the ground that they're covering up, then there's shelter and food all of a sudden. So consider those places as insects harbors as well. Even hay and grass around the side that can provide a bit of shelter. A shed of tin, rubbish, that sort of stuff, lying around silos can all provide a bit of shelter as well. Once we're, that's the hygiene line of things. The second one, we've done hygiene. We want to look at structural treatment. So that's about killing any insects that may be left after we've done the cleanup. But let's look at hygiene first. So, as I said, hygiene is not just limited in the silos, but if we look at the picture on the top left here, we've got a bit of grain left in a hopper underneath the silo. So, really quite a nice breeding ground there for insects to start breeding away and quickly infest around the silos. The bottom left there, we've got in the back of a truck. Again, remember equipment in the cleanup. Make sure the trucks, chaser bins, mother bins, trailers and all those sorts of things that the grain go through are really cleaned up well. When we're looking at silos, even consider the design of the silo and the pad that the silo sits on. I've seen silos put on a concrete ring rather than a concrete pad. It really, it makes them a bit hard to clean. If we use a nice, smooth concrete pad, that really does make hygiene a lot easier to sweep that grain up. When we're looking at spilt grain around silos, people often get it quite pretty, quite pretty. panicky about spilt grain around silos. To be honest, grain that's spilt thinly across the ground, sort of one grain thin, doesn't provide enough shelter for insects to live that well. A grain piled up, if you've left a pile of grain beside the silo, that will provide enough shelter for insects to live. So just consider that when you're doing your clean. Again, headers are a really common spot for insects. In the top right, and picture there, we've got some trench aeration in a big flat bottom silo. Something that we often see is particularly the imported silos now are coming in with the full floor aeration systems. We've got a false floor, perforated floor, aeration. The issue with those sorts of setups we find is that they're impossible to clean under. So after a few years, there'll be a bit of dust residue, a bit of grain residue fall through that floor. And again, create a perfect harbour for insects to breed under that floor. Come along and put fresh harvest grain in. And as soon as you put it in, the insects are infesting it. So that trench aeration, for aeration cooling, trench aeration is quite adequate. And the real advantage is that it's easier to lift up and clean out. So you can do a better job on hygiene. So again, when you're looking at new silos, whether it be flat bottom or cone bottom, look how easy they are to clean. How many spots that grain can get stuck there. We're looking at types of cleaning, obviously the broom, compressed air and water for the cone bottom silos is a good idea. And then remembering to dispose of that waste grain. So not leaving it in a bucket or a wheelie bin beside the silos or in a pile. We actually want to get rid of that grain. So go and bury it, burn it, feed it to some livestock, maybe get rid of it somehow. Even spread it out thinly across the ground so it will germinate some way to get rid of it. Machinery. Here's some more research just to try and highlight. The guys up in Queensland again did some research for us and asked a harvest contractor who considered that he cleaned his header fairly well at the end of the season. They said, can we catch the first 40 litres of grain that goes through your header at the start of the next season? And he said, yeah, no worries. So they went along with the bucket and collected the first 40 litres of grain that went through the header. And actually stopped counting when they found a thousand less of grain borer in that first 40 litres. So that's a header that was thought to be reasonably clean, but they hadn't used dry aside in it. They hadn't used a diatomaceous herb product. So again, encourage you what you think might be clean is still an insect harbour if we don't use a structural treatment on it. So, what time of year should we clean up? Again, we look to research to tell us these answers. We rely very heavily on what that research finds. And what it finds is that insects will breed and travel when the temperatures warm up. So you can see in June, July there where the temperature's cold, insect reproduction is slowed right down. And insects don't tend to move around as much. So that's the best time to do our grain strudge hygiene. So even this time of year, we're in August now, before the temperatures really start to warm up into spring, good time to do our hygiene, clean them up, get rid of them before they start breeding and moving around the farms. So that's hygiene, structural treatments. What are we trying to do with structural treatments? The main one that we would suggest people look at is a diatomaceous earth. So that's a naturally-filling product. It's a mine product, not chemical based. It's actually, if you put it under a microscope, it's actually, it's very abrasive shaped. And it actually scratches the waxy cuticle on the insect and they end up dehydrating. So it's a physical mode of action. So insects can't develop resistance to it. That's why we really like the product. And therefore is effective on all the main grain storage pests. So that's what we're trying to do is we clean the storage up, create an unwelcome environment. And then we really try and kill any insects that may be left there. Often get asked about other products people think look similar like lime. Again, the testing that's been done shows that lime was really not effective. We need a diatomaceous earth product. Something like a dry side we've found to be most effective. We're looking at how much we actually need. It's really not much. Take an example of a 112 ton silo. We only need about 420 grams. So we're not talking about big volumes here. For something like a harvester, we might need a couple of kilos through the harvester in the front. But again, not large volumes. We're not putting a heap of this stuff in. Just enough to really light dusting. How do we do it? How do we apply DE diatomaceous earth? For silos, cone bottom silos, a little blow back gun. You can see here. So we open the top lid of the silo, open the bottom lid. We measure out our quantity of diatomaceous earth in a bucket or something similar. And then using the air compressor and the Venturi gun, the blow back gun, we blow it up through the silo. And you'll quickly get a cloud of dust here like in the right hand picture. Once you've put your measured quantity in, step back, have a look, and the dust will start floating out the top of the silo. When you see that start to happen, shut the lid, close the bottom manhole, and that silo's done. Other people I've seen and heard used leaf blowers and those sorts of things to get the dry side or diatomaceous earth dust in the silo. Anything like that would be effective. What we're trying to do is get an even coating around the silo walls, the roof even, and the base. It can be applied as a slurry, which is particularly good for sheds. Concrete up the walls and the fair ones in the shed mixed with water. It is pretty hard on pumps, so be aware of that. But if you want more information on that, I'm certainly happy to help with that. applying as a slurry. Do consider personal protective equipment, a dust mask, some gloves, and certainly goggles. As I said, this stuff is pretty abrasive, so it's nasty in the eyes. Make sure you do wear goggles and a good dust mask. The other warning I'd put out there, as I said, it's not chemical based. It's a safe product to use. I would hate for people to run into trouble, though, storing pulses or oil seeds. If they happen to get a bit of this diatomaceous earth settling in the cone of the silo, and then you've got a bit of discolouring on a pulse or oil seed, I'd hate for that to downgrade your blow of grain. So my suggestion there is to use it, do the hygiene, do the structural treatment, the diatomaceous earth, and then just before harvest, if you're going to store pulses or oil seeds, just give that silo a quick win. Just to make sure there's no quantities of DE that are compiled somewhere that might get in your sample. A few key points on diatomaceous earth. It takes about five to ten days to kill insects, but it's effective in the six to twelve month range. So again, that's why we suggest it can be applied in the outsource. I guess as near as ten days before harvest, but the earlier the better is the key message there. It can be applied as a dust or a slurry. It's most effective in dry environments, so under 65% relative humidity. So the thing about inside your silos is relatively dry. Inside your equipment, the machine in the shed is again relatively dry. It's not chemical based, no pest resistance, which is a really good thing. So that's why we recommend that as the main structural treatment. As I just said, I recommend to rinse silos just before storing oil seeds and pulses for that added extra security to make sure we don't get downgraded on those high value commodities. And again, make sure we wear our gloves, dust mask and actually goggles I need to add to that. Just a warning, it is registered product. It can be added to grain. It says on the label you can actually add it to grain. That used to be a common thing these days. We see more and more grain buyers actually prefer that it's not used in that way. It really does change the flow of the grain. We're talking about cereals only here, of course. So we actually don't recommend it be added to grain. There's other suggestions I hear people say, what if you add a little bit to the first bit of grain that goes in the silo and add a bit to the last bit of grain that goes in the silo to form a bit of a cap or a barrier. In theory, yes, good theory. What happens in practice is we can expect there'll be some insects in that grain bulk somewhere. And if we've got a barrier on the top and the bottom, we're not only trying to stop insects from coming into that grain, it will also stop insects getting out. So we might go and have a look at the grain in storage at any point and say, well, it looks clean. I can't see any insects, even sip a bit of grain from the top. But what could be happening is insects breeding down in the middle of that grain stack. They're just not coming to the surface because of the DE. So actually wouldn't recommend that as a practice or the risk that there could be insect activity in the middle of the grain stack in the middle of the silo. And we can't see it at the top or the bottom because of the DE effect. Key points to run through again, clean up during the cooler months. So this time of year is well worth doing. Make sure we include machinery in the cleanup, dispose of that waste grain, and then follow up with an application of structural treatment to the grain storage and equipment. So that's hygiene and structural treatments. It's really quite quick and simple. There's nothing too complex to it, which I really like. Anything that's simple and also cost effective, I think is a good thing. So it doesn't have to be complicated common sense, but it really does make a big difference. So starting with our grain storage clean gives us our best chance for a good result. So I'll ask in a minute for you guys to certainly use that question and answer window. Type your questions in there now. I'm sure there'll be some questions that you guys will come with or that I might have sparked. While you're doing that, I'll just reiterate if people would like more information, storedgrain.com.au is a website you can go to. You can contact us, the Grain Storage Extension Team on info at storedgrain.com.au. Or you can call the hotline at any stage, 1-800-LEGLE. And that will put you in contact with your closest grain storage specialist. While you're typing your questions, another reminder that the next webinar will be on the 10th of September, same time, 10am. And we're going to have a look at upgrades to existing storage. So keep an eye out for that one. Also keep an eye out for an email that will be sent to you shortly. We'll just put a 30 second survey in there to get some feedback on these webinars and check if you guys are getting value out of them and what we could do to improve them. So if we've got any questions, any question that would like to ask, happy to take those now. If you want to type them in the question and answer window. If you want to type them in the question and answer window. If you want to type them in the question, please. Just while you're thinking of your questions there. One of the ones I often get asked at workshops is can we use a product like diatomaceous earth around the silos. So around the base of the silo. What you can. As we said in the previous couple of slides there. It works best in areas that are dry. Under 65% really. So for those areas around the silos, we were actually better off to use a spray on product. Something like a for nitrathione as a structural treatment. It's good for the grass and gravel or concrete areas around the silos. We can actually use those sort of products as a structural treatment for that purpose. And keep the diatomaceous earth for the inside the storage and inside the machine. Can't see any questions coming in. I hope you need those questions. You guys will figure out how to ask them. By all means if you do think of something later. Please feel free to call that hotline. 1-800-WEAPLE. And that will come straight through to your, your newest grain storage specialist. Certainly consult the stored grain. Com. Com. You website.
