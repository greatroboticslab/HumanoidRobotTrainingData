 What is the fastest way to level up your hourglass for Guardians of Fortune? To be honest, this has been a mystery to me since hourglass PVP's launch back in Season 8. But thanks to fellow content creator Toxie Sinclair's latest video, we have a new strategy in town. That is exactly what we're going to be doing in this video, copying, um, I mean, taking inspiration from an amazing video, which you should all check out in the description of this video, and practicing it on my own. I mean, that wasn't the intention of one of my streams, twitch.tv slash mystic, but when things got interesting, I decided it was worth a shot in today's adventure. So, what is the strategy? We aren't going to go the conventional route here and dive below the waves to matchmake. Instead, we're going to let the people invade our servers. Why would anyone do this, you may ask? Well, it's so that we can take advantage of one of the most forgotten features that Season 8 brought us. The treasure grade. You see, Toxie discovered that regular old merchant commodities boost faction grade. And as you can imagine, farming commodities from outpost to outpost is not too difficult of a task. There is only one problem though. In order to purchase commodities, you need to be a representative of the Merchant Alliance. And with the fast queue times on EU servers, this could become a problem, as we would want to end up with grade 5 faction stash, but also grade 5 Athena emissary, which requires at least two fights to achieve. Again, I didn't originally plan on doing this method, but after my second fight, well... I'm going to brag about it. I found out that you couldn't defend. Maybe there was a vurder in one of the watches under a Vivi, including more expenses than augment $1,000. Let's explore one of the tunes in the world. Oh Right Oh I'm gonna get stolen commodities. Let's go away. I actually kind of want this Things changed So there I was faced with a decision do I risk my streak and go for Toxie strategy or call it quits and sell As you can imagine from the title of this video. There was no quitting. We was going for the faction champion After purchasing commodities. I re-raised Athena emissary in the case of evasion However, I happen to notice a grade 5 merchant emissary and for sure knew this was going to be the key to getting grade 5 faction stash Am I supposed to feel bad chat? I don't Come on He left okay The thing is people I I need I need his supplies. I need his loot You know piratin is just You know, it is where you make it right After sinking the ship and starting to board on the treasure we had done it We had successfully reached grade 5 But just as that happened. Well, we were invaded I knew this would happen All right, we're grade 5 let's uh, let's vacate All right How does this dude have legendary c-dog chat? I think he's an average tdmr third ship of the day and decided to travel over to Plunder Outpost, as this is the closest outpost nearby where we could sell all of our loot without complications. Here would be where we would wait in preparation for our fourth and final fight for faction champion. We waited for a lot longer than expected as the server seemed to be full, so after removing one afk sloop later and waiting for our next battle, well, let's just say it's not how I was expecting to reach faction champion. Yes. Okay, right chat, here we go. Okay, they didn't bother turning, so there's now a Fort of the Damned on the server. Okay. Okay. Where did they go? Is he trying to sail to the Fort of the Damned? What? No, I don't. Fort runner. Maybe, maybe it was meant to be. What? What the hell is that? Oh, man. Oh, man. Not like this. All right, let's see how much rep we get. Come on, let's see the rep. Bro, I got a whole, a whole level for that. Whole level. Chat, I got a whole level. This isn't exactly how I pictured my last battle going and was contemplating continuing this streak, however, I decided against this as a Fort of Fortune spawned on the server, meaning that the likelihood of invasion was very slim due to the players not leaving our waters. However, after all of the fighting, the reputation gained by reaching faction champion while at grade 5 seemed to be worth it. That is, if you're lucky enough to consistently be invaded. See what rewards we get? I don't think you get anything extra for having ending with a grade 5. Right. Okay. So, let's see. Let's see the rep. A whole level, basically. In conclusion, do I recommend giving this a try? Sure, but it's very circumstantial and requires a lot of luck. Once again, thank you Toxie for making your video on this strategy.
