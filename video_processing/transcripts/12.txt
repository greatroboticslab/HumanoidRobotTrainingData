 So in this video I will be harvesting some of our corn. Now this is the first year I've been growing corn so I wasn't really sure when it would be ready, how to tell if it was ready, how to even process it to get it ready to freeze, all of the above I wasn't sure of. So when I did some reading I have read that the silks should be nice and dry to touch, so a little bit crispy and no green left on them. So I kind of went with that. I didn't peel any of the husks back to check on the kernels but I just went off the silks being nice and dry and it pretty much well worked. I mean the ones that I harvest and the silks were nice and dry, they seemed to be pretty good. Taste wise I'm not a hundred percent sure if I have harvested them at the right time going by the silks because I haven't actually eaten any yet. So it was really good to see so many bees in the garden although it did make life a little bit harder to make sure I didn't get stung but it was really good to see them there. So there's a lot of different opinions on Google and Facebook about how you should freeze corn. So I was going to do some frozen with the husks on and some frozen with the husks off, not blanched and blanched. However, I noticed that some of our corn cobs didn't have full pollination and they would have been fine for kernels which is what we used them for but it was really hard to tell with the the husks on which ones we should freeze whole. So what I ended up doing was ended up removing all the husks and blanching them because I didn't want to freeze a whole corn cob in it, not have any kernels on the inside. So that's what I ended up going with in how I processed them. I also read that you should, when you finish blanching them, put them into some cold icy water. So we filled the sink up with some cold water and added some ice so we could add the warm corn to that to immediately stop the cooking process. And when it came to the amount of time to blanch it for, I had varying opinions from anywhere from four seconds to six minutes. So I was like, I have no idea how long to blanch this for. So what I ended up doing was blanching for a minute. Not sure if it was long enough, not sure if it was too long and I haven't actually tried the corn yet but I'll see when I actually get to taste the corn how it turned out. A side note to this is during a lot of the reading that I was doing, a lot of people said the corn ended up very mushy after they defrosted it and ate it. So in amongst those opinions, a lot of people said that microwaving it and also grilling it prevents it from being too mushy. So that is how I will cook it. Probably not in the microwave because I don't really like using it too much but probably will grill the corn so that it doesn't turn out too mushy but I probably will boil some just to check how it turns out. So once the blanching process had completed, so over the one minute time we chucked it in the sink with the icy water and as I said it just stops the cooking process, doesn't overdo it too much although blanching for a minute I don't think I would have had too much of a problem but followed the correct steps anyway. Then any of the corn cobs that weren't really going to make it as a full corn cob as a meal, we decided to cut the kernels off and we just placed them into sandwich bags in portions of how much we would eat for a meal to freeze that way. So if any of you guys out there watching this have any recipes on or any ideas on how to process corn to freeze, please comment down below and let me know because that will be really handy for next year. So when it came to the full corn cobs I just vacuum sealed them in portions of what we would eat a night so for us it's just like one corn cob each and vacuum sealed them in. So I'm unsure how this corn will actually taste. I have left some on the plants at the front so that I can actually take some fresh stuff and just cook them up see what the taste is like. These are heirlooms so I can keep some seeds, however I've read that the hybrid varieties are a lot sweeter so I may try some of them next year just to get a view of the difference between them. So I will let you know in further post how this all turned out and good luck with your corn growing season. Thanks for watching! Thanks!
