 Yes, now we are discussing about Hathi culture business in that today we are discussing about tomato farming. Tomato farming, it is used in diverse ways in the form of salads, juices, sauces, ingredients for various culinary preparations etc. Chena ranks number one as the largest producer of tomatoes. And next point is tomato plant information. Botanically called Solanum lycopersicum tomato plants are actually vines. If given adequate support, they can grow up to 6 feet tall. In traditional farming, in greenhouses, they can live up to 3 years. The vines are covered with short hairs all over and the flowers are yellow in color. And next point is ideal conditions for tomato cultivation. A warm but cool climate is needed for tomato. It can't tolerate high intensity as well since it affects the fruit pigmentation. And next point is climate for tomato farming. Being a warm season crop, tomato crop requires an ideal temperature of 21 to 23 degrees C. Tomatoes are highly sensitive to climatic changes. For ideal growth and yield, tomatoes need a diverse set of climatic conditions at every stage of growth such as seed germination, flowering, fruiting etc. Tomatoes are highly sensitive to the growth of tomato plants. Tomato farming needs a warm and poor climate. With medium sunlight, both heavy rainfall and prolonged dry swell affect the growth of tomato plants. And next point is soil for tomato cultivation. Tomato needs a diverse set of climate for its growth. It can grow on all types of soils from light sandy soil to heavy cleavy soil. A well-grined soil with a depth of 15 to 20 cm is ideal for yielding a healthy crop. pH for tomato farming. Soil pH falling in the range of 6.0 to 7.0 is preferred. A slight slimming along with adequate nutrient supply can help tomato crops grow better in acidic soil. And the next point is water requirement in tomato plantation. Tomatoes are sensitive to both excess water as well as very little water. A major challenge in tomato cultivation is maintain an even moisture supply during summer. It is necessary to irrigate the crop once a week while irrigating it once in every two weeks is sufficient. Care should be taken to prevent any drought period after a heavy watering dose. The next point is drought followed by an abrupt watering during the fruiting phase would cause cracking in tomatoes. And next point is crop rotation with tomato crop. Tomato belongs to solanaceae family. It can't be rotated with other crops belonging to the same family like potato, tobacco, bell pepper, etc. It must be rotated with crops. It must be rotated with crops. That to fulfill the nitrogen content of the soil. Leguminous crops are the most recommended for this purpose. Tomato crops are hence rotated with leguminous crops like beans, pulses, etc. Next point is land preparation for tomato cultivation. The field for growing tomatoes must be thoroughly decimated and fragmented, thorough repeated ploughing. It needs about five plugins before cultivation. The step after ploughing is levelling. The land is levelled evenly and beds are prepared for planting the tomato seeds. The land must be sterilized after ploughing so as to destroy the disease causing pests and microbes. They are commonly sterilized by solarization. And next point is season for tomato plantation. Since tomatoes are day neutral, they can be grown during any season in the southern parts. In the southern parts, tomatoes are transplanted in three cycles. December to January, June to July, September to October. In the northern plains, the transplantation schedule is below. The crop. The crop. The next point is crop. July, karib crop. October to November, Rabi crop. February to February months, Jade season. It transplanted during September and October months in the southern plains. Only if adequate irrigation facilities are available. Similarly, in the northern plains, in the northern plains, rabi crop may not be taken since they may get affected by frost. During winter. Here is the tmin among the seeds. Pamato seeds. And from September to September and October months in the southern plains. Only if adequate irrigation facilities are available. Similarly, in the northern plains, rabi crop may not be taken since they may get affected by frost during winter. during winter. Tomato seeds. These seeds, the seeds are first raised in nurseries and then transplanted after a period of 30 to 45 days. Hybrid and exotic varieties are sown in small plastic cups while other varieties that are not too closely to produce are sown in nursery beds. specially raised for the purpose. Next point is transplantation. Transplantation is done in shallow furrows or flat beds as per the irrigation availability during the monsoon and in case of heavy soils, seedlings are planted in dry ridges so that the water doesn't get logged. In case of hybrids and in determinate varieties, seedlings must be stacked using bamboo sticks. If planted in furrows, then they are planted at a spacing of 30 cm from each other. For spring summer crop, the spacing maintained is 75 to 45 cm and 75 to 60 cm for autumn and winter crop. And the next point is harvesting from tomato plantation. Tomatoes can be harvested within 2 to 3 months of plantation depending on the market demand. 8 to 10 cm harvesting of tomato is done on yearly basis. The average tomato crop yield per acre in India is about 10 tons. Although the yield varies from 15 to 20 tons per acre in case of irrigated crops. This is the information regarding tomato farm. It is having very good demand in the world for tomato juices, tomato sauce and vegetable market. In the vegetable market also this is the main source of cooking pot. Tomato is having very good demand in the market. So it is also a profitable crop. But only one thing is marketing areas also farmers should find out. According to the marketing areas they should supply in time frequently. Then only it will be successful. Only lots of tomatoes are coming and there is no market means they will loss so much. So periodically supply has to be there for the market units. So marketing strategies are most important. And where to supply, when to supply and how we can collect the money. All these things also we should think of. Then only it will be a successful business. Because production will be there. And as well as demand we should catch the demand also in the same way. That is also most important. So communications are most important in this manner. To farmer to farmer and farmer to dealer and supplier and distributor and all these. If you maintain all these things you will be successful in this business. Wishing you all the best. You see you on the best.
