 Hello, everyone. My name is Brian Parman. I'm the NDSU Agricultural Finance Specialist, working for the Department of Ag Business and Applied Economics and NDSU Extension. In today's presentation, I want to talk a bit about backgrounding profits and returns for fall of 2021 headed into 2022. And this year, we're dealing with some different circumstances than we have in the past with respect to livestock, particularly cattle prices, live cattle and feeder calves, as well as feed costs, things like hay, dry distillers, grains, corn, those kind of things, crop commodity prices a bit higher this year. But we've had some strong livestock prices this fall. And as we go through this, we're going to see how this is going to work out for feeders potentially across North Dakota and the surrounding states. So for the scenarios that I'm running here and that we're kind of going by, these are the price assumptions that we are working from this year. And this is quite a bit different than last year. Corn, for instance, we're assuming about $5.75 a bushel, corn silage at $55 a ton, dried distillers, grains well above $200 a ton at $220, most of the things like limestone, limestone, bagged salt and premix. I didn't change too much. But hay prices are quite a bit higher, approaching $200 a ton for alfalfa hay and $125 for grass hay. And then the yardage fee. We settled in on about 40 cents a day for yardage. Part of that due to the higher energy costs that folks are facing this year with higher natural gas prices, fuel prices, things like that, as well as potentially electricity costs. And then trucking, last year's assumption was about 75 cents per hundredweight, increased it quite a bit, almost 66% to $1.25 per hundredweight. On the other hand, interest slightly down to about 5% assumption, and then shrink and death loss staying roughly about the same. So this is kind of the price assumptions here. Obviously, as I go through this, you can adjust those in your mind a little bit if you need to. If you think some of those are a little bit too high, perhaps too low, that's just sort of a good benchmark that we feel like that we're running from here. And so if you think, again, that some of these are off, feel free kind of to maybe make a mental note and adjust them accordingly. So these are the six different scenarios that we are running through and that I'll be going through during this presentation. And we have basically three steer and three heifer backgrounding scenarios. One of which is the 1.8 to 2 pounds average daily gain for steers. And these animals start at 500 pounds and are sold at 800 pounds. And this is the feed cost under those assumptions that I was running through per day. So feed costs per pound. Then the 2.8 pound scenario, slightly heavier, purchased heavier and sold a little bit heavier. That's 2.8 pound average daily gain. That's going to be about 60 cents per day, or 60 cents per pound under that ration scenario. Then a much faster daily gain at 3.6 pounds a day. And these are starting at 575 pounds all the way out to about finished. And that comes out at about 64 cents a day. Heifers, we start with a scenario of lighter weight heifers, 450 up to 750 at 72 cents a day. And then we have 550 weight up to 850 weighted across the 77 cents per day. And then a 2.8 pound average daily gain for heifers from 525 weight to 805 pounds at a feed cost of approximately 59 cents per day. So again, I'm going to, so to start with, I'm going to go through the steer feeding scenarios first. And then I'll go through the three heifer scenarios after that, and then we'll compare, compare all six. So this is the prices that we, that I'm, I'm using for this presentation here. Uh, and this came from the North Dakota weekly auction summary ending, uh, the week of November 13th, which, uh, this is, this recording is being made on the 15th. So this was Friday, uh, last week, um, and showing the, the steer prices for the, for the various ranges of weight. And then I put a live steer price there assumption at the bottom. So for, for fat cattle at about $131.40 cents at 1350 pounds was the last report I saw for some of the, uh, the buyers down in, in, uh, Dakota city kind of area. So these are the assumptions working from here, uh, for as far as the value of the animal coming into your backgrounding operation, and then the value that you would be selling at, at whatever the weight happens to be 750, 850 pounds, et cetera. And note, I use the average price here. I don't use a high and a low. I'm just simply using the, the average price. Cause again, this is an estimation, uh, for these scenarios. So this is our first scenario, uh, we're running here, and this is that 500 weight to 800 weight, um, steer, uh, at 1.8 pounds per day. This is the ration being fed. And you'll note here on this, this right column where it says dollar per head per day, that's not dollars per pound. So you'll note that, uh, uh, uh, it's a dollar 30 per day. And we, I gave, uh, the previous chart that showed the price per pound. This is, uh, um, you know, the dollar, uh, cost per day versus dollars per pound, assuming that 1.8 pound per day, um, scenario. So we put it through our, uh, our backgrounding budget, uh, estimator, and I use the North Dakota State University backgrounding budget and make some modifications to it. Uh, for instance, if you open up the budget, you see online down below the return to labor and management risk, you'll see all these prices for feed stuffs. Uh, I simply didn't use that because I already did the ration assumption up there. So, uh, for the sake of this presentation, I just put it in as the cost and you'll see the feed cost of $1.30 per day, rather than, rather than going and filling out each individual item within the ration. Uh, since I already showed what the ration was, you can, you can see that. And what we have here in this scenario to get to approximately 800 pounds, that animal is going to be on feed for 167 days. And with the lot cost and the shrink and the trucking are, uh, total return over labor and management is about minus $8. And the biggest reason that this one actually takes a loss, and, and this is kind of the scenario for all the steer scenarios is that the, the current market price of, uh, feeder calves steers, particularly that 550 weight, uh, area, uh, though, those animals are bringing a relatively strong price. So in order for someone to make any money on, uh, on steers, that 500, 550 weight, they're going to have to put on more weight faster than, than 1.8 pounds per day is, is just kind of what this is telling you. So they're on weight long enough here and, and, and it just takes too long. It's just too slow. And so essentially there just isn't a big return if we're not putting on the weight on our steers fast enough. So at 1.8 pounds that, that steer, um, it, it just isn't generating the returns at 167 days on feed, but you'll see going forward, uh, this back, uh, backgrounding and putting on the weight, at least on steers and, and heifers as well, uh, is, uh, is a, is a profitable, uh, situation going forward. So our next scenario, uh, we're running, um, 575 weight animals to 855 pound animals. And this is again, is a, uh, uh, higher rate of gain, 2.8 pounds per day, instead of that 1.8 that I, that I had in the last scenario, uh, total feed cost per day is a bit higher, uh, because of the fact that, that, that we're putting on more weight. Um, so it's a dollar 68 per, per head per day on average to, to get from 575 pounds to 855 pounds at 2.8 pounds per day. And you see here, here's the ration, uh, you know, a lot of silage corn being, being in this ration as well as legume, hay, and, uh, some corn and DDGs. The budget here and the profitability on a 855 weight steer or putting on 2.8 pounds from 575 to 855 is a fairly strong, uh, proposition. We hit, we have decent, decent profitability numbers at $65 per head. And that's at that average daily gain of 2.8 pounds per day, basically signifying that being on feed less time, uh, while still putting on the weight, uh, actually pays, uh, as far as steers go. And even though the feed cost is, is significantly higher at $1.68 per day, uh, because we're putting on more weight, uh, they're only on feed for a hundred days instead of approximately 167. And under that scenario, we wind up with a situation where we have, uh, essentially, uh, a much stronger return and $65 per head. So it just shows here that, that again, as has been in previous presentations or renditions of this, that I've done, uh, in different scenarios and feed costs in years past, that it just shows that putting on weight faster tends to be a much more profitable proposition for, uh, producers, uh, than, than, than leaving them out there for a longer period of time as, as yardage costs wind up, uh, eating up a lot of the gains. So here's our final steer scenario. And this is basically taking them from a calf at 575 pounds all the way out to pretty much a fat, uh, calf and, uh, just about ready to do be slaughtered. And, and this is a much faster, uh, rate of gain at 3.6 pounds per day. And of course, for that reason, you're looking at $2 and 32 dollars and 31 cents per, per, uh, per head per day to, to put on that kind of weight with, uh, much of the ration coming from silage corn and, uh, uh, corn, uh, grain, as well as some DDGs and grass hay. But this is the, the ration for, for this scenario. Now this is the, the spreadsheet that comes out there and you'll note that despite the higher cost per day and the longer time on feed, because this animal is going to be on feed for 95 days longer than the previous example, uh, even though we're putting on more, uh, more weight per day, we're just flat out putting on more weight. Uh, so it's going to stay in the yard a lot longer. And this, this basically pays out to $85.43, uh, per head. So, uh, again, a decent amount of profit to be made, uh, backgrounding this steer to, to, uh, basically all the way to finish. Uh, you'd be looking at making $85.43 a head approximately, but it's also worth mentioning the longer they're on feed, uh, even though we're putting on the weight, then there, you run the risk of things like feed costs changing or livestock markets changing because under these scenarios, remember I'm assuming a fixed, uh, fat cattle price and 200 days from now fat cattle prices could change. They could be better or they obviously could be worse. So somebody may be looking at this as a, as a possibility might want to go ahead and, and use some of the revenue protection products by a futures contract or something like that, uh, in order to, uh, uh, take advantage of the prices as they are and ensure that there aren't going to be, uh, any losses. So our next set of scenarios, the three that we're going to talk about here are, uh, heifer feeding scenarios. Um, and, uh, uh, uh, these follow along similar lines to the three steer scenarios we had with some slight modifications. So here are the prices that are used for the heifer feeding scenarios, and they're pulled from the same auction report, uh, looking at, uh, feeder heifers, um, all the way from, you know, 300 pounds up to a thousand pounds. I don't have a, a fat heifer price on here because I do not do a, a finishing heifer, uh, scenario, uh, in, in, in any of the three that you'll see going forward. So the first scenario being done is 450 pounds, so lightweight heifers up to 750 pounds at a relatively low average daily gain. You know, the lower end of the steer is at that 1.8 pounds per day and a good share of this ration coming from silage and, and a good share coming from grass hay. And that comes out to $1.29, $1.30 per day to put on this 1.8 pounds on our heifers from 450 pounds to 756. So to achieve, uh, or arrive from 450 to 756 pounds at 1.8 pound per day, that animal's going to have to be on feed for about 170 days. So quite a long time on feed for these, the, these heifers here are almost as long as finishing out a steer, uh, all the way from 550 to, to 1,270 something pounds, uh, um, at 3.6 pounds. But you'll notice down here a positive return of $36.18, despite the fact that they're in the lot for quite a while at 170 days and this feed cost, and of course yardage fees wind up adding up day after day after day. But what we're seeing is that as far as heifers go, even in the, in the least, uh, or the slowest, uh, rate of gain scenario that, that's being done from the lighter weight, lightest weight up to 750 pounds, still a profitable endeavor. And when we're covering all of our costs here and, and, and netting $36 per head. So that's a, that's a pretty strong return out the gate. And I've done this, uh, presentation or similar for, for the last several years. And typically this, this particular scenario is not really a moneymaker per se, or it hasn't been in the past, but it is this year. And one of the big reasons is that price gap between steers and heifers, when you go from 558 up to 700 or 800 pounds is, it almost goes away. I mean, 800, 850 weight, 750 weight heifers are selling for almost as much in, in a lot of cases as a similar weighted steers. So that price gap closing significantly, you're winding up making, making up a lot of ground financially by, by putting that weight on. So not only are you making money putting on some of the weight that cattle buyers are looking for right now, but you're also making money by closing that price gap between steers and heifers. So even, even the, this scenario here, which, which typically I've done in the past has not yielded a positive return. It is this year at $36 and 18 cents per, per head on average. So our next scenario, it's the similar, it's the same daily rate of gain at 1.8 pounds per day, but we're starting with 550 weight heifers up to 850 weight, instead of 450 to 750, like the last scenario. Again, though, using, relying heavily on silage for our feed and grass hay as well, with a little bit of DDGs in this case, for a daily cost of $1.39, let's call it $1.40 per day, to put on that kind of weight under this scenario. So basically we are putting on the same amount of weight, 300 pounds, at the same average daily gain, so that these animals are going to be on feed pretty much the same amount of time as the previous scenario, 170 days. But you'll notice that the, the feed cost does change, but look at our return to labor and management. Going from what it was, 36, 37, maybe up to $40 per head, all the way up to nearly $100 per head. And the reason why is the amount that's being paid by cattle buyers for these 850 weight animals? That price is really strong on heifers, 858 heifers, where the price gap between heifers and steers is pretty much gone entirely. And so with strong prices for 858 calves, it's really, it's really reflected here in this return of $100 per head. So we are making some money on, on, on putting on, on the feed, on the, the, the feed end of things. But really a lot of this money, a lot of these returns are coming from that price, uh, that strong price for 800, 850 weight heifers, as well as steers for that matter. But that's, that's really where the strength in this is coming from and showing that, uh, this year, uh, compared to all others is, is an outstanding year really to be backgrounding your heifers, uh, and taking advantage of what the market is telling you. And what the market is saying is that, uh, feed lots, finishers, uh, they're really wanting these 800, 850 weight calves. That's, that's what they're, they're all looking for and, uh, they're willing to pay for it. And it, and it just shows right here. So the final scenario, uh, doing with, uh, dealing with heifers and the final scenario of the, of the presentation is heifers from 525 pounds to 805, uh, at a, at a more rapid rate of gain at 2.8 pounds per day. So a pound more than, than the previous two scenarios. And this again, will be a little bit more expensive per day to do because we're putting on more weight, relying heavily still on silage, some corn and grass, hay, and then, and then a bit of DDGs as well for this scenario. And here's how this particular scenario shakes out. Uh, you can see that, uh, the animal is on feed for fewer days instead of 170, it's down to a hundred because we're putting on, putting on the weight faster. Uh, the beginning value, uh, the sales prices are, are slightly different, uh, and, and the feed cost is higher. Uh, but you'll note that the return to labor and management is actually, uh, the highest of all three scenarios in this case, uh, this showing that putting on the weight, uh, faster does in fact pay. Okay. And, and you'll notice that the, the risk of keeping, uh, of this particular scenario is probably lower because they're on feed for fewer days. So you're making just as much money as you did in the last scenario, but not having it, but keeping them in the yard 70 fewer days. So you, if you think of it from a risk standpoint, it's less riskier, the long, the fewer days you have them less susceptible to changes in feed prices. Cause again, as I make these scenarios, we're assuming consistent corn prices, consistent cattle prices, consistent oil feed across the board, consistent shipping costs, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And if any of those, you know, take a turn for the worse. In other words, feed costs go up or cattle prices decline. Uh, a lot of this is, is going to change. Um, and so, uh, the, the, the, the faster that we're able to turn this, the, the more likely this is to come true, unless you're taking advantage of some of these, uh, these, these price protection type of, type of avenues that, uh, our producers have, which you can see here, this is a really strong indicator that, that backgrounding heifers this year is, is a, is a, there's a, there's demand for it. There's demand for animals that, uh, at that 800 to 850 pound range. And that, that again, that finishers are looking for, for weight being on the animals that they're buying. So here are the six, the six scenarios that were put together and, uh, just comparing them all side by side in terms of how many days they were on feed, the profit and loss total per head. Okay. And then the dollars per day profit or loss in, in the one case. And here we see that this, this final heifer scenario, the 2.8 pounds per day with a hundred days on feed, uh, that's a really strong profit margin, uh, making, uh, about a dollar per day per head, uh, that they're out there. So that's, that's one of the better, uh, scenarios that I have. And you'll notice that while you do make about as much money at 1.8 pounds per day in, in terms of, uh, total profit per head, uh, the, the, the dollars per day is quite different. And that's simply because of how many days you have to keep them to get them to a hundred, uh, uh, 850 pounds at 1.8 pounds per day versus getting them to 805 pounds at 2.8 pounds per day. So you can see that that daily, uh, amount of profit for the, for the 2.8 pound scenario, the 525 weight to 805 weight. Uh, that's a, that's a pretty strong indicator that, that folks are paying for, uh, our producers or backgrounders to put weight on the animals themselves and steers again, you know, they're, they're pretty strong. Uh, there's a strong draw to do that too. It's just that we, you got to kind of be picked, pick the correct scenario to, to operate under. And in this case, the best dollar per day scenario is 2.8 pounds per day from 575 weight to 855 weight, which gets you about 67 cents per day on your steers for a total per head of $65. Now feeding them all the way out to finish does make the most money per head on, in, in the case of steers at $85 and 43 cents per head, but the dollars per day is 44 cents because they're on feed for so long, you know, 195 days. So you do make total, total profit per annual is higher, but your profit per day is lower. And then again, you got to think about the risk in the, in the 575 to 855 weight category. They're only on feed for a hundred days in the, in the 575 to finish it's, it's an extra 95 days to be out there to run the risk of death loss and shrink and all kinds of weather issues that may slow the rate and, and caught and wind up digging into your profits a little bit, not to mention market situations and conditions that can, that can change this too. So the key points and the key takeaways that I kind of want folks to think about in, in this, uh, from this presentation is that essentially cattle buyers are paying for weight. Uh, they are, they're looking at, uh, 550 weight animals versus 800, 850 weight, or even 750 pound animals and saying, you know, we're willing to pay up for these heavier calves simply because there's less risk. Uh, feed prices are relatively high right now. I would rather get my lot full of, uh, animals that are closer to, to being, uh, taken to market to, to being fat essentially. So I'm, I'm willing to pay a lot more to pay for the price of the year. And the price gap on heifers and steers closes pretty remarkably when you go from those 500 and 500 pound animals up to 8, 850, uh, it almost disappears entirely. And it makes backgrounding heifers this year, extremely attractive. One, one of the more attractive options, uh, in recent memory is, is, or at least since I've been doing these, uh, comparisons that if there was a year to background heifers and put the weight on as quickly as you could, this is definitely one of them. Uh, again, a lot of things can happen in markets. And so, you know, if you're going to do this, it may, may pay to take advantage of some of the pricing options available, uh, to you. Uh, but right now it definitely looks like something that, uh, if you have the means to do it, it, money can be made, um, uh, putting weight on and backgrounding. And then a few more key points, uh, putting on weight fast still pays, uh, even, even at $5.75 corn and higher hay prices, uh, it seems like no matter what, I don't want to say no matter what, I'm sure we can find some situations where that's not the case, but it seems like that putting on weight faster typically winds up paying more. And, and part of it's a function of how these budgets are set up. Uh, because what winds up happening is yardage fees eat into your daily profits pretty quickly. And if you're keeping track of your own time, uh, wear and tear on machinery, uh, other labor costs, if you have any kind of paid labor, utility bills, et cetera, et cetera, wear and tear on your facilities, uh, the longer the animals are in there, the more of that, those costs add up. And so if, if you're making money on feed, it is always going to pay more to, to, you know, if your feed, if your returns on feed are positive, just, just weight versus feed, it's always going to pay more to, to basically put the weight on faster. That's just kind of what these scenarios show and, and what's been true for the last several years that, and, and even when, when I've shown a loss, the loss is smaller when you put on weight faster. That's just, that's been the case. And, and right now it is certainly true, uh, as has been in the past. Well, I want to thank everyone for watching. Uh, hopefully you were able to get something out of this presentation that helps you with any decisions that you might have been pondering or thinking about going from, you know, this fall headed into next spring, as far as background in calves or selling, selling out right, right away. Uh, you can see my email address is right there on the, on the screen. Uh, if you have any questions about this presentation or something you want clarification of, I, I'd be happy to answer any questions that I can. So thanks again for watching and, uh, hope you all stay warm this winter. Thank you.
