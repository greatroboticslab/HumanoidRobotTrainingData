 We're here in the Willamette Valley on Dickman Farms, and we're at the confluence of a couple of fields. It's an excellent opportunity to talk about crop optionality. So if you look to my left, we have a field of tall fescue. This is a grass seed, so all of this will be separated, and all of that material will turn into the type of grass seed you buy at Ace Hardware. Over here, we have a wheat field, so this is all growing wheat. And then behind me, you have a series of onions. So when you think about crop optionality, functionally, you want to rotate between the type of crops you have on a single field. When you have several fields next to each other, this provides an excellent opportunity to move from one crop to another and manage that all in one area. So rotating between crops on an annual basis allows you to then resist that buildup of both disease pressure as well as pest pressure.
