 Today my team Prishy Shakti will be presenting a problem statement ID 1554 which is about smart irrigation system for Prishyajan farming. Nowadays water scarcity is a major challenge in agriculture leading to insufficient water usage and reduced crop year. Traditional irrigation method often results in overuse or underuse of water. However, we have developed a smart irrigation system that utilizes IoT and technologies to monitor soil moisture, nutritional level and weather condition. This system will provide real time data for farmers enabling them to make informed decision on irrigation scheduling thus optimizing water usage and maximize crop year. We have come with a robotic car fixed with different sensors to provide such as for soil testing, soil moisture, soil temperature then NSP. For motion we will be using IR sensors, for paste IR thermal camera, for air humidity and temperature, for checking nutritional level of soil and PK sensors and for detecting rain sensors. All sensors are controlled by ESP826 which drives the car according to the data described by the farmer. The data collected to an IoT Blink platform which is analyzed precisely by using AIML. These data are shown to the farmer using user interface which shows temperature, water level, humidity, GPRS, nutrition and insects. According to these analysis, the motor that is connected to our fertilizer pump is opened and closed by one click of the farmer. Here we have also used GPRS sensor to detect the location of the car. The robotic car consists of Omnibill which is free to move in any direction without any trouble. Here we have also prepared a video for this prop. Thank you.
