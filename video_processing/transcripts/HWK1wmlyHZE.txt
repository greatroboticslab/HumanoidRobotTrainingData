 Greetings to all. Welcome to another enlightening video on organic farming practices. We're excited that you're here with us as we explore the captivating world of guava cultivation. Guava is not only a widely grown fruit, but also cherished for its nutritional value and sweet taste. This video will provide you with a comprehensive look at how guavas are meticulously cultivated to ensure top-notch quality. Our journey begins at the Guava Sprouts Garden in Changhua County, Taiwan, where the initial stages of guava cultivation occur. The process starts by selecting robust guava sprouts, which are then carefully planted to ensure they are firmly rooted in the soil, a crucial step for their early growth and development. Once the sprouts reach about one month old, they are ready to be transplanted into farm fields where the real work starts. Each sprout is planted with precision, maintaining a recommended spacing of 1 to 1.5 meters between trees. This spacing is vital as it allows each tree ample room to grow and access necessary nutrients without competing with neighboring trees. After planting, the guava trees receive water through a drip irrigation system, which ensures that each tree gets an adequate amount of water delivered directly to its roots. This efficient method conserves water while providing essential hydration for growth. Water for irrigation comes from nearby pumps and undergoes filtration before use to remove impurities that could harm the plants. Nutrients may also be added to support healthy tree development. As the guava trees mature, regular maintenance like trimming is required, particularly when they reach around 4 months old, to promote better growth by focusing nutrients on fruit development rather than excess foliage. Trimming also enhances air circulation within the tree, reducing disease risk and encouraging healthier growth. Additionally, grass around the trees is regularly removed to prevent nutrient competition and keep the plantation clean and pest free. One critical stage in guava cultivation is preparing for fruiting when farmers start wrapping individual guavas on each branch after cutting branch tops to direct nutrients towards fruit production, ensuring large sweet fruits characteristic of high quality pearl guavas. Interestingly, only one fruit per branch is allowed following a selective process common in Japan known for yielding superior quality fruits. The wrapped fruits are protected from birds, insects, rain and excessive sun exposure using nylon bags that create a controlled environment for consistent high quality product development over approximately 1.5 months until ripening, especially crucial during rainy summers when unwrapped fruits can easily perish. While waiting for ripening, branches undergo periodic pruning, maintaining tree health, promoting better yield, and better yield. And focusing nutrients on developing fruits.

Approaching harvest, sweetness is checked, ensuring readiness using specific techniques, guaranteeing only the sweetest and most mature are harvested, meeting consumer taste and texture expectations. Once the desired sweetness is achieved, the anticipated harvest is conducted carefully, avoiding damage. Scissors are used to cut, placing gently in trays, preventing bruising. Post-harvest, stems are removed, followed by thorough washing to clean and remove residues accumulated during growing. The fruits are then neatly arranged in trays and wrapped with shock-absorbing foam, protecting them during transportation to reach the market in perfect condition. Finally, they are packaged, loaded onto trucks, transported to distribution centers at various locations, and sold to consumers, marking the end of the journey from farm to market. Enjoyed by Pete.
