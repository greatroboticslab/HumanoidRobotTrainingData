The moisture was good, the commodity prices were real good, and we happened to gamble at the right time. It was one where we probably shouldn't have gotten as many sales as we did, but it was because of some of our loaner programs. Instead of taking the guys that the tractor broke down, a used tractor that we had, we took them a new one. By the time we got their used one back, they said, we'll just keep it. It's one where you don't know until you try, and a lot of these guys won't be able to make up their mind until it's sitting there, and they put on 10, 15 hours on it and realize, you know what, maybe I can do this. Money happens to be there, or sometimes you might not realize that sale right away. It might be a year down the road, but if the seed is planted, that's all you can hope for, is that it will grow, and it will get you something to come back with. Because that growth for us, yeah, is exceptional. And do we know if we'll ever have another year like it? No, we sure hope we do. We hope we can improve on that year. But, at the same time, we're optimists, but we're still realists. And if we can't go forward and realize that we might not have another good year like that, we aren't being truthful to ourselves. And that's been the biggest thing. We're honest with ourselves, we can be honest with anybody. The main thing about the growth, that's a great number of what have you. We measure our growth with customer satisfaction. If the customers are happy, tell your neighbor. If you're upset, call me. Call Kent. That's what we're here for. Because, at the end of the day, that's all that matters. I mean, we're here, we chose the profession to sell equipment in a rural area, which is probably not the most glamorous for some people. But you know what? It's a great place to raise your family. The employees love it. Some of the other amenities that we have around here, hunting, fishing, you know, hear the birds sing, so to speak, on it, which would drive a lot of people crazy. But if we didn't love what we were doing, we wouldn't be here. And the customers is our testament to it. With our sales and things like that, they're, at the end of the day, what we need to do to be successful. In a small community in the Pacific Northwest, a dynamic company is growing.
