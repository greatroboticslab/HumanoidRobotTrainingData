 Hi, I'm Faneela Moran. I'm a presenter and sustainability activist. I visited Malawi with Concern Worldwide as part of the One Planet for All campaign to see the Climate Smart Agriculture programme they support in rural communities. 80% of people in Malawi are employed in agriculture. However, Malawi is one of the countries most affected by climate change. Climate Smart Agriculture increases the resilience and productivity of the land affected by climate change, and Concern works with farmers so they can better use the natural resources available to them to become more resilient.
