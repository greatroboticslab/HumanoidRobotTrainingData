 Hi, I'm Sarah and here on the Made of New Farms channel today, it's Upcycle Monday, which means we're going to be making a solar-powered drip irrigation system for free, just using recyclables. The first thing you need for this project is a one liter, completely free of any labels, at least as much as possible. And then you make a cut about this line here. First things first for any project, especially with little ones around, it's fair to not have them with arms reached when you could be cutting something. I'm going to pass them off to his uncle. Oh yes, hiya. Now you just need a two liter bottle, again as free as label as possible, can't get everything all the time. And cut about here. Now that we have all of our parts cut up and ready, it's time to install the watering system into our plants. It's important to note that this is not to replace your regular watering system, but just to help for when it gets hot and your plants are going to need the extra moisture. So, leave the cap on so the water does not absorb into the dirt. That's for the other parts. So, I think I'm going to install it right about over here. I missed the plants, but you get not too close to any one particular root structure. And you're going to want to go a couple inches down because you want to get some of the base into the dirt so it doesn't really loosen up too easy. And because we're not forecasted to have any rain in the next couple days, we're going to add some water into it. I'd say about there. Never waste. Got some extra water, you might as well just splash it around. Any thirsty plants that might be nearby. Now, the cool thing about this irrigation system is that we then place this piece of plastic over the water. And down a little bit. So, as the heat heats up the water, it causes the water to evaporate. The water evaporates and condenses and goes down the sides of the container, back into the soil, watering all the root systems at once. And that extra time of thirst. Thank you for joining us and have a great day. Now remember, if we all gave up our lawns for gardens, there would be no more hunger in America. Tell me when. Stay. Stay. Stay. Good boy. I'm not good at this. Do I have to do it like right here? Uh-huh. I can't handle it down. Hold on. Hi. Today on the Manaboo Farms channel... Oh, I messed up. I go, then you go, okay? Okay.
