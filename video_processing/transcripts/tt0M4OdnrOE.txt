A SIMPLE WAY TO CREATE AN OUTDOOR STORAGE SPACE

 I was sick and tired of having all my tractor tools stored in the weeds, grass growing up through them. You couldn't mow around it. They're just buried in a pain to get to. I put 300 linear foot of parking pad storage for all my tractor attachments, 10 foot wide. It took three rolls of fabric, 100 foot rolls of like the under driveway geotextile fabric, 40 yards of 21 AA. I've got 2,000 bucks into it, about a dollar and a half a foot. I'm sure there's a lot of other ways to do it, but this way worked for me. Keeps the weeds at bay nice high and dry above everything else. They're not going to pool up in water. I'd love to have covered storage for them all, but this is a big improvement. What do you think?
