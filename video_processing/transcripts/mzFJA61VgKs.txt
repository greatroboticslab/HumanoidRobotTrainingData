 Thanks Amanda. Really appreciate being in Seattle and enjoying this cool and wet weather. I want to discuss a concept today and right off the bat when I looked at the title and I saw the word new in there I thought wow there is nothing new. I don't know if anybody listens to TED Talks they were talking a few weeks ago or an episode about how there was really nothing new in the world and that we just sort of reinvent stuff and so this is not new. This is taken whole cloth from the New Zealanders and from the British Isles and so with that if you're you know if you have to have new you need to go somewhere else but it is a good concept what we have some preliminary data but it's a mature technology and it's used successfully in different parts of the world where it does this where it rains frequently and during the winter feeding period. So I'm going to talk about three sets of issues to just set the stage with what the soil and water effects are from feeding cattle on pastures during the dormant period that we had in the mid-Atlantic part of the United States. And then I'll talk about wood chip design and that's an ag engineering component and I failed to mention that I have collaborators from University of Vermont, a biosystems engineer, Joshua Faulkner, and a wood scientist from Duck West Virginia University who worked with wood chip issues on these feeding areas. And I'll go into a little bit of biomass preliminary data that we've come up with on what's suitable to use. So anyway within the mid-Atlantic we have about 1.1 million beef brood cows and that's minuscule when you look at you know the plains and or Texas you know it's like one county in Texas could have you know a third of a third of this population. So it's not big but it's our main activity and our herd sizes have increased you know we've gone from in the last 30-40 years from 15 to 20 head up to now 200 head. And so that puts pressure on our pastoral systems and we you know initially we fed square bales and we had barn kept animals and we moved to round bales and everything went outside. And there's some serious impacts with that. So what's a wintering site? It's an area where cattle are fed during the dormant period. Sites includes you know stored feed. You have to tram across to feed concentrates with the tractor. Sheltered area if you need it. Calf hudges and a winterized you know watering system to complete the system. And this is what we get. You know I do this talk to farmers all the time and you know they just nod their head. They see this. They're the brown donuts in our pastures at the end of the winter. And you know here's a beautiful spring picture and you see a pasture on the other side that has not been used as a dormant feeding winter area. And then one on this paddock and the differences are tremendous. You know it's they all say that they don't do tillage but they really do. This is this is pretty severe tillage in a saturated condition. So you know I go back and it's like the thing is it recovers fast and farmers forget like that. You know they get ground cover again and they're like hey everything's okay. And they go on and then they're back in the same situation. So I like to to use this classic study that Owens et al. I met these guys right before they retired. They're from Coshocton, Ohio. They had a wonderful ARS station there that was closed down recently in the last five years. But they had monitored watersheds across the place. And what they did was they did long-term studies which we don't we can't afford to do and which we don't do anymore. But they had a period of from 74 to 86 where they continuously used a pasture. They summer grazed and then they winter fed on it. And then they pulled the cows out and they only grazed during the summer for another period of years. And then the final period they only harvested hay. And the results they had 60% of their sediment loss occurring during the dormant period. Not surprising. But the greatest losses were during March to June. You know and they had 40% of their loss during April. And that's when our hydrologic cycle is really letting go. We have a lot of spring rains and a lot of tillage by the cows. So this is just a you know kind of gives you an idea of precipitation. Precipitation was even across all these years from 74 to 94. There's some fuzziness to it. But look at the runoff events during this 24 or 12 month use period of the pasture. Where they had cows on it. They had compaction. And they increased runoff during that period. And as soon as they pulled the cows off and only had them grazing, those runoff events, even with the same sort of rainfall activity, dropped off significantly. And then during the hay only, again, there was a huge reduction. So we know that, you know, it's just a nice quantification of the impacts of winter feeding on pasture. And then here's the corresponding sediment loss numbers. And as soon as you pull them off, you know, all your sediment losses are during that winter feeding period and are caused from that in a pasture system. So the kicker for me, and this is why I try to tell farmers, is that you're killing your production. You know, you've got, here's June 1, and here's percent, here's when you're getting back to 100% ground cover. And through the years, there were times when they were well into the growing period and they only had 60% ground cover. So, you know, using your money crop as a winter feeding area does, you know, it's a huge conservation effect to move those cows off of that pasture land. In our neck of the woods. And so this is what we stole from the New Zealanders and the Brits and the Scots and the Irish. It's an engineered heavy use area. They call them outwintering pads. So if you want to learn about how it's done and what the deep research that's been done, go look at the British work and do a search on outwintering pads. So what you do is we have really good clay soils, subsoils, our B horizon. We just create these humps and we put in drainage and we added 57 aggregate stone, a good size gravel at a foot deep. And then we added our wood chip base to that. And, you know, we do have local materials and that's an advantage. We have a lot of eastern hardwoods and a lot of scrap trees that are not valuable for the timber industry. So we can chip those up. It's an environmental benefit, but there's some cost and management to it. And French over in England, they just wanted to compare cattle performance on in-house versus keeping these cows out on a wood chip pad. And basically they found that the wood chip pad from feed intake and, you know, carcass weight, live weight, were all similar or better than these other management systems of keeping cows in. So there was no sort of physical detriment to having cows outside in the weather. So here's a picture of the one that we put in. It was a very low budget. We had a conservation district that helped us establish this. You will notice that it's next to a NRCS heavy roofed winter feeding area. So we combined a outwintering loafing pad with a feeding area. And they do recommend not to feed on these outwintering pads because you'll create too much concentration of manure around the feeding area. So you feed somewhere else. So there's the drainage pits. And there's the gravel. There was a drain pipe that went into those low spots. You can see our deep soils with... And this was the outpipe. And so you do have to manage processed water. And that scares our farmers because for them, EPA looks at a pastoral system as being benign. And so they say, oh, well, if we pull cows onto a pad, we're creating a point source. But, I mean, the economics have to come into play. How much damage are you doing to your resource? So we put in a standard septic tank. And within that septic tank, we had a pretty nifty little device that was on a pivot. And what it did was it allowed accumulation of effluent into the septic tank. The flout would come up to a horizontal position. And then it would fill the pipe and it would flop over and empty that tank all at once. And that would dose our vegetative treatment center. And there's our vegetative... Our dispersal pipe for our vegetative treatment center. We set up another one at our dairy science farm in Morgantown. And we just tapped it into the lagoon. So those are your choices. You can either have a treatment center or put it in a tank where you can spread it. Cows are very happy. They had about 50 head. And they kept these cows on this pad for about a 65-day period during the highest peak of our hydrologic cycle. So costs. Everybody wants to know what do these things cost. And a wood chip pad. And this is dollars per cow. It's reasonably priced. In England, I think that they probably cut all their trees down so it's a little higher cost. And roof to winter. This is the standard roof to winter feeding barn and manure storage is considerably higher. Pouring a concrete pad or a gravel pad is... The gravel pad is about the same price or a little bit higher. Stocking density is... You do have to give the cows about 110 feet. Because you want them to be able to lay down. You want them to be... Have comfortable and have space to not be crowded. And so these are comparables. These are our NRCS standards that we compared this to. Because we don't have a lot of alternatives. So we had a very preliminary sampling protocol. We did grab samples at 12 storm events. We'd run up an hour and a half whenever it looked like we were going to have a runoff event. And go grab a sample. Or the county agent would help us do that. And we had a pressure transducer in the septic tank so that we could count how many times that flout raised. And so we knew what our amount of outflow was for the system. And we had reasonable numbers. You know, we... Again, we compared this with an earthen pad or a concrete pad. And we were comparable to a concrete pad. And we were much less than an earthen, you know, dry lot for numbers. And, you know, the Brits have found that, you know, their estimation is that 90 to 90% of the nitrogen and phosphorus is in the manure that's sort of held in this filter bed that the cows... ...the cows loaf on. Again, with looking at runoff coefficients, again, we were comparable with concrete and we were much better than earthen. And you can see, you know, our non-winter periods, what happened was we had rain events that stretched out to longer times. Between the rain events. And so the wood chip pad acts as a sponge. And so the nice thing is that you don't get an immediate runoff. You get some capacity to hold a rainfall event. And then in the warm weather, it'll actually evaporate back out. So this kind of shows that with these are individual rain events. The bigger the circle, the higher the amount of rain. And you can see that as the duration of dry period, as you have periods of dry between your events, less runoff occurs. So there's that, again, that sponge effect to where only after you get like repeated rains day in, day out, that the system starts to get leaky. So it's kind of a nice system to moderate runoff. Nutrient cycling, what do you do? Well, the recommendations are to have a layer of chips that are the filter bed chips in the lower area that are fist size. Okay, and those are difficult to find for us because most American chippers chip a very small chip. And so we're still struggling at finding that English style large chip for the base. But on the top, you want a much more comfortable, finer chip for the animal's comfort. And that gets pulled and spread. And the English have found that soiled wood chips or composted, you know, if you apply those, you can get equal yields at the same, you know, application of 54 pounds of synthetic. And so you can see there's quite a tie up of nitrogen that would be slow release over time, which is kind of nice with a woody product. And like, I'll go back, the big chips, there's no degradation. So you have to sort of sit and pull those off after the end of their life, which is about five to seven years. And then it's like, what do we do with those? I'm still, I'm really curious what the Brits do with their big, large chips that you can't spread on the pasture of hayland. So this is just sort of a pictorial of application rates and response over time to that top portion that has to be managed routinely on the pad. So, you know, there are disadvantages, you have to have, you know, repeat applications of a thin layer. And you do have to deal with effluent management. Prolonged freezing is an issue, or is it not an issue? To me, if I've got frozen ground, I'll move my cows out onto frozen ground where they can't destructively tear it up. So to me, it's like, get them off the pad and use it strategically in the wet, sloppy weather. And sourcing wood chips, I think that that's a real issue. And I am down to about a minute. So I'm not going to talk about wood chip quality or, but you can come and talk to me about some of our treatments. There's our latest pad at the dairy farm. And we are in the process of asking for an interim practice standard for our state. And we just need to continue the work and the forestry equipment piece is huge, getting the right chip for this technology. With that, I appreciate your time. One quick question. Yes. So if the fist-sized wood shift after five years is still fist-sized, what determines that it's exceeded its lifespan? The permeability or the functionality of the pad is so clogged with manure at that point that you have to pull it out. And you have to have a flow-through system. Once it clogs up, it'll just start ponding. So every five years you have to refresh that entire bed? Yes. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I think is Viewer Pro Am bili is closed. At least. Like Cinematography is closed. At least for theitingus for infection. Yeah, Peoples can MSC's droplets can be set off freely, so it becomes a Tipp swings or anything to FF. Well if your pronunciation gets no more laundering from the ear in terms of the direction of the e-book used allowed in the building, you can end up having so much cumawa at the puke. Yeah, thank goodness. Anything that is the maddening, you can make sure it's my guest. I'll definitely be your holiday for the, you can remove this, it'll be your person. Alright, so i'm touching my guest, because there are one of these smaller ones, and I am staying up to just Ban on the street at the frontside. Anyways, and we will have an end of the time level,
