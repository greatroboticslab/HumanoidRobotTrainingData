 Hi there, I'm Matt Vandyhart, Pioneer Field Agronomist from Central Iowa, providing a late season corn update. Now I know each year we tell you to go assess stock quality and grain quality to set your harvest plans. This year I want to make sure you are assessing late season plant health and tar spot. We didn't have the right conditions for tar spot this year across the Midwest or even across Iowa. We didn't have a lot of cool and wet conditions, at least in southern Iowa. Certain parts of Iowa have seen some tar spot really get aggressive here through August in September. I'm in a field here of a susceptible competitive hybrid that obviously had a lot of tar spot in it. You know, got into the even the upper leaves or just completely covered in tar spot. So susceptible hybrids can get affected by tar spots very aggressively, very quickly. But this set in this field late enough, you know, we're close to being able to harvest this field. So it may not have had a yield impact at all, but we need to take note of these fields. We need to take note if you have some tar spot out there or some bad late season plant health. It may affect stock quality, but also the next time you have a hybrid there, make sure it has a good tar spot rating. We're working on ratings at Pioneer. We have some preliminary scores and some that are work in progress. But if you need a hybrid that's got a good tar spot tolerance, we're going to give it the best in our lineup. And so be asking those questions, be planning that out the next time you have corn there. Take note of those fields. I know some of you may have some drought stress and it's not tar spot out there, but at least check those fields ahead of harvest. Tar spot is something that we need to manage holistically. We need to manage with fungicide time properly. But a lot of that fungicide residual comes off late in the season when this aggressive disease comes up and attacks a lot of susceptible hybrids. So just take note of this disease and take note of any stock quality issues ahead of harvest. If you've got any questions on tar spot, our tar spot tolerance ratings from Pioneer, or even just questions about late season plant health, let us know at Pioneer and have a happy harvest.
