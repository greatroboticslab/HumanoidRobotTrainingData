 Yeah, thanks for the introduction and thanks to the organizers for inviting me. It's really a pleasure to be speaking here today. Yeah, I'll be talking about the hidden forces on the ground, soil biodiversity for agricultural production and environmental integrity. So I think we all know that there's organisms living in the soil and it's actually a huge variety of creatures living there and they are all doing things. So they are eating organic matter, they're feeding on plant material, they're feeding on each other and they bury through the soil, they poop in the soil, they eat each other's poop. So there's this whole complexity of things happening and together these actions result in certain ecosystem functions. And these ecosystem functions can result in ecosystem services, that we as humans also depend on. So soil organisms are important for organic matter decomposition, for example. They can improve soil structure and water infiltration. They can store nutrients, release nutrients, improve plant nutrition, provide pest control and so on. However, it's been increasingly shown in recent years that with increasing land use intensification, a lot of these organisms are actually negatively affected. So they get reduced in their diversity and abundance and can even go locally extinct in certain fields. And now the big question is if we lose these organisms, do we also lose these important functions that we depend on? Or if we phrase it more positively, if we promote organisms and find ways to promote these organisms in soil, can we actually improve our ecosystem functioning and get more sustainable cropping systems? So to put this in a theoretical framework, when we look at a natural ecosystem, we have usually relatively high plant diversity. We have rich and diverse soil life and we have very efficient internal resource recycling processes that keep this system alive over long time spans. So it's a very sustainable system, but it's not very productive in agricultural terms. When we compare this to an intensive agricultural system, we often have a huge amount of external resource inputs. You have crop monocultures and soil life is not doing so well. So we have less well developed internal resource recycling processes. And we also have much more losses of nutrients, for example, to the groundwater or as gases emissions into the atmosphere. So these systems are very productive, but they're not sustainable. So ideally, we want to combine aspects of both to create a sustainable system where we have less external inputs required. We have an intermediate diversity on the field and we have a rich and abundant soil life. So we have very well developed resource recycling processes and little losses to the environment. So we have a productive and sustainable system. But first of all, we have to answer the question, how important are these soil organisms actually for ecosystem functioning? And to find that out, I formed an experiment a couple of years back in so-called lysometers. So lysometers are basically big pots placed in the outside and free air. And each lysometer can hold a soil volume of 230 liters. We filled these lysometers with sterilized soil and then added two different soil biological treatments. One we call the enhanced soil life treatment containing soil organisms smaller four millimeters. And the other one was the reduced soil life treatment that only contained organisms smaller 11 micrometers. So basically microorganisms, but nothing else. These lysometers have a hole in the bottom where the water running through the soil profile can be collected and later analyzed for nutrients. And we also performed gas measurements of nitrous oxide and N2 gas into the air to look at nutrient losses. So we planted a maize crop in these lysometers and let them grow to maturity. So they got big maize plants as you would find it in the field. And when we look at the data, so we see these dark bars are the enhanced soil life treatment and the light gray bars is the reduced soil life treatment. What we found was that with reduced soil life crop yields were significantly lower. And we found a similar pattern for nitrogen uptake and for phosphorus uptake. The effects were strongest. So actually it was more than half the phosphorus uptake with reduced soil life. Looking at the nutrient losses, we found the opposite pattern. So with reduced soil life, nitrogen leaching losses went up massively. And the same was the case for nitrous oxide emissions and an important greenhouse gas. And also N2, another gas being emitted was massively increased. So this study shows that soil organisms have a great potential to enhance the nutrient use efficiency and support crop growth in cropping systems. So this study shows that the soil is a lot of soil and the soil is a lot of soil. So this study shows that the soil is a lot of soil, but it is a model system. And actually most knowledge we have about soil biodiversity and how it affects ecosystem functions is derived from such model systems that often use sterilized soil. So we have to re-add organisms and yeah, we actually do not know how well these results transfer to the real world, to an agricultural field. So I was trying to get closer to that and get some, some, some, some answers in real world settings. I did a postdoc in California at UC Davis and there went to 30 different field sites differing in management intensity. So I selected 10 grassland sites and 10 more sustainable tomato rotations that received cover crops over the winter and compost applications. And then 10 intensive tomato rotations that only received mineral fertilizers and synthetic pesticides and so on. So I expected reduced abundance and diversity of soil organisms with increasing management intensity. So I went to all these sites and we sampled and analyzed the soil communities. And we also extracted soil cores from all these fields, placed them in a greenhouse, planted tomato crops there and measured nutrient leaching losses and gas emissions and looked at crop yield also. So when we look at the data for the soil communities, obviously the grasslands on the left and the intensive systems on the right. So we found that with increasing management intensity, indeed most parameters for soil organisms showed a negative trend. The more intensive the system was, the less diverse and less abundant soil organisms there. Then we related this data to some ecosystem functions that we measured. So here we see the relationship on the left with microbial biomass in the soil and tomato yield. We found a significantly positive relationship. So with more microbial biomass, we had higher tomato yields. Similarly, we found for the more nematodes we had in the soil. We also found higher crop yields. Looking at nutrient leaching losses, we found some relationship with the ratio of fungi to bacteria in the soil. So the higher this ratio was, the lower the nitrogen leaching losses there, which is something that has also been shown before and hypothesized that a fungi dominated system has a more close sustainable nutrient cycling compared to a bacteria dominated system. So, yeah, taking together this study could partly confirm what we found in a model system, which was very nice. And then I performed different study focusing on a buscilla mycorrhizal fungi or short AMF. We heard about mycorrhizal fungi before. So, our arena was managing mentioning them and yeah. These fungi form symbiotic relationships with the majority of land plants and including many major crops like maize, wheat, potato, tomato and so on. And they are mostly known for improving plant growth and nutrition. And they also other benefits that have been shown to be provided by AMF. So, the way this symbiosis works, you see here a microscopy picture of a plant fruit and the blue structures is the AMF structure and actually enter the plant roots. Even the plant root cells and develop there. So, if they are not there, then they spread a network of fungal hyphae into the soil. So, here we see the plant fruit and then we see these fine root structures spreading out in the soil. So, basically they extend the root system and you see that they are much finer than the plant roots. So, they can enter soil pores that the plant cannot access. And then they take up nutrients from the soil and give them to the plant. The plant in turn performs photosynthesis and gives carbon back to the fungus. So, both partners benefit from this association. So, I did a postdoc then at UC Berkeley. And there we looked at this mycorrhizal fungi in a long-term field trial. The century experiment at Russell Ranch in Davis where since more than 25 years different cropping systems are compared. And we were interested in the communities of mycorrhizal fungi in these systems and how they affect crop yield. So, we selected four management systems there and we planted two different tomato plants in these systems. So, one is a normal tomato plant called 76R that forms regular associations with mycorrhizal fungi. And then we had this tomato mutant called RMC that has a mutation that prevents it from forming normal AMF associations. So, they only form a, yeah, very reduced associations with AMF. So, we planted them there and then we looked at tomato yields to basically find out, yeah, how yield is affected if we remove the mycorrhizal association from the crop. And we see here the data for the biomass on the left-hand side on the crop yield. Dark bars are the normal tomato plants and the light gray bars are the mutant plants with reduced mycorrhizal colonization. And we see some differences here depending on the cropping system. But importantly, we see that when we remove mycorrhizal associations from the system, we get up to a 30% decline in yields. And also overall, we found a positive correlation. The more mycorrhizal we found in the plant roots, the higher tomato yields were. So, I think this study also impressively shows that soil organisms can really or really do support agricultural yields and matter. So, to sum up these studies, we saw that soil organisms possess a great potential to increase crop yields and simultaneously reduce nutrient pollution to the environment. And we could confirm these results in field settings. So, soil life is a crucial factor for sustainable agriculture and substantially supports crop yields and supporting your soil life is good for the environment, good for the plants and good for you if you're a farmer. So, you have more money in your pocket and need less fertilizer, for example. So, this is all very nice, but we have to get this information out to the public. And we don't have much time because soils are threatened. So, we lose soils globally at an alarming rate. And there's like problems like soil compaction, soil salinization, desertification and soil erosion through wind and water and also soil sealing through human activities that are major problems and also harm soil life. And most people or the general public is maybe not really aware that soils harbor an entire below ground universe. So, actually, one quarter of the global biodiversity is found in soils and one teaspoon of soil contains more living organisms than we are humans on this planet. So, there we got this idea. We have to do something to spread the word about these facts. And this is where the underpants come into play. So, we trying to make the soil life visible because we have to spread the word. Because the protection of soil life is deeply available as it's eta, that is soSeride, man. And this conversation congt gebenper here is people who have been doing more. And this information is completely vacant to rope. So, there's links to that. Of course, again, we're going to make these取ingt projects up to get us to get us out of these." And, of course, that particular slides can be made part of that. identify hig That is super relational data感覺. And it's also, people you can take an answer to fight and аthง email. There's telling us about data NCL También. So, I think theirinden is of 10-13 or 12. And that's very interesting to answer. So, the other thing to get us to reduce our questions, let us know that as well know that we'll have the results here, it will be decomposed by solar organisms and over time disappears. So we started a citizen science project called Beweisstück Unterhose in English. It's a proof by underpants where we wanted to bury underpants together with the Swiss population with the goal to raise the awareness about the importance of soils and also to perform some scientific assessments of soil biological activity and soil health across Switzerland. And also we want to develop recommendations for best management practices to support soil life. And I have to mention that we did not invent this idea of burying underpants. So this was actually a group of farmers in Canada that started with this in 2015. And it has already been done in several parts of the world. Currently there's also a project in Hungary going on and in Australia. Yeah. So how did we do it? We put together a soil lab kit, DIY soil lab kit. So we provided standardized underpants to all the participants. We also included tea bags to look at the tea bag index, which is a scientifically more established method to look at decomposition processes and soil. And so we put these things in the package and shipped it to all participants. And then they got instructions on how to bury the underpants. And they take a soil sample, which they ship back to our labs. And they place the tea bags in the soil. And each participant received two underpants. So one will be retrieved after one month, the other one after two months. And we also together with this partner Spotteron, we've developed an app where people can enter management data and information about the field where they buried the underpants and can also upload pictures of the underpants. And then they ship after the two months, they ship the soil sample and the underpants back to us to AgroScope. And then the other ones that we actually do is to analyze them. So we, um, aimed for 1000 participants and actually all the available spots filled up before we officially announced the project. So there was really a huge interest. Um, and we aim for 50% farmers and 50%, non farmers being private gardeners or just regular people. Um, we, we told them they can bury the underpants, wherever they want can be in the forest, It can be in some rural spaces in the city, can be in the community garden, in the rooftop garden, or in agricultural fields. Here you see a map from our webpage and each of these dots actually represents several spots where underpants are buried. So you can zoom in and see all the details and look at pictures and look at site information on our webpage, which is available in three Swiss national languages. Yeah, then we had to go to raise the awareness and we had an event for the media for the start of the project. And actually it was overwhelming how well this was picked up. So we were in the media globally with this project in Ghana, in India, China, the US and so on. And we also had several television features in Swiss and German television. And importantly, all these media releases talked about that soils are alive, soils are important, and soils are threatened and we have to take care of them. So they really got our message across, which made us very happy. So we also put together a picture book about soil life called the Jungle and Soil, but it's only available in German and French. We think about releasing an English version. We'll see how that goes. Yeah, it's actually very entertaining and interesting. You can learn a lot there and it's available in bookstores in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, or you can also directly order it through us. You can write an email, then you get also a special price when you get it through us. Yeah, and then there's still the scientific assessments to be made. So the research questions we're trying to answer with this project are how soil biological activity distributed across Switzerland. And is this biological activity linked to soil biodiversity, soil quality, crop yields, and also how does management affect the soil biological activity? And yeah, we also want to assess whether underpants can really serve as a meaningful and easy to use indicator for soil health that everyone can use in their backyard or wherever they want, because this method has never been scientifically assessed. So yeah, we really hope to get answers here how useful the underpants actually are. So right now we're dealing with the samples. We have almost 900 soil samples, 1,600 underpants, 10,000 tea bags. We have a subset of soil samples where we look at soil microbial diversity, 800 questionnaires with site information management data. So we are really busy in the lab right now. So the underpants, they are photographed. And then with imaging software, we determined the amount of degradation of the underpants, the tea bags are weighed. And yeah, we hope to be able to make recommendations for best management practices in spring of this year. What we can tell already, or what we have already, is data that the citizens actually entered in the app. So they could assess how strongly the underpants were degraded. So we see here the results of the one month. So orange means the underpants are not very degraded. Green man means they are strongly degraded. So what we see so far after one month, months there's less degradation than after two months. And we see that there are no large scale spatial patterns. So yeah, looking at the details will be interesting, hopefully. So there's more to come. If you're interested, you can subscribe to our newsletter on our webpage. It's on the landing page. You have to scroll to the bottom to find it, or you follow us on Facebook and Instagram. Yeah. And with this, I'm at the end. So I quickly acknowledge, acknowledge people involved in this research, plant soil interactions group at Agroscope and my colleagues, the project team of the underpants project, people at UC Davis and Berkeley. And I thank you for your attention. I'm happy to take questions. Thank you very much, Franz, for your talk. And now we also know what, how it was all conducted regarding the pants and very inspiring, I want to say. Maybe I'm start collecting some pants now from now on. It's okay. I will start right away with the question of Felix. He's asking, how was the soil sterilized and how was ensured that it was sterile? We sterilized the soil with X-ray radiation. Sorry. There are these companies that provide a service mostly for medical equipment. And yeah, depending on the dose of the radiation, you can determine how how sterile the soil is, because there's always some bacteria that can survive such processes. So we made sure that we did not have fungi in the soil anymore, no mycorrhizal fungi and insects, arthropods and so on. There might have been still some bacteria have been who sorry, alive in the soil. But yeah, but we also saw in our control treatments that they were mostly free of mycorrhizal, for example. We had some contamination probably through the air because it was outside. And for the greenhouse, we often sterilized the soil with autoclaving. Thank you very much. Can you please stop sharing this screen? Yeah, sure. I mean, I love the biodiversity of the of the plants, but thank you. OK, next question will be by Landert. Using to the tomato varieties introduce more differences than equals minus AMF only. So how do you know the yield differences are AMF based? So these the this mutant is actually derived from this 76R wild type that we used. So they are directly related and it should only be this one mutation that that causes differences in mycorrhizal colonization. And this pair of wild type and mutant has been used in several studies already. They have also been tests planting them in sterile soil to look at growth differences without mycorrhiza. So they show fairly similar similar growth, even in sterile soil. Thank you. The next question by Vitalia is how deep have you buried the panties and how do you account for the differences in land use? Because there is a huge difference in arable land and heavily irrigated home garden. So, yeah, that's so first first part of the question. We buried the underpants vertically in the soil so that the seam on the top looks out of the soil surface. So it was probably from zero to 15, 20 centimeters. They were buried in the soil. So, and yeah, of course, there's a huge variation. And that's why we also tried with this app and questionnaires to get as detailed information as possible about what's happening on these field sites. Is it irrigated or not? How often is it irrigated? Which fertilizers do you use? Do you apply compost? Do you apply pesticides? Which crop is growing there? And so on. And with all this information, we hope to really get meaningful answers. Thank you. And how did you create the treatments with reduced and enhanced soil life? And maybe the first part of the other question of Vitalia? Yes. So we we used sievings basically. So we sift the soil through four millimeters and then we had an additional step in the greenhouse. So we put the sift soil into sterile soil in the greenhouse and planted some plants in there and let them grow for three months to, yeah, to let the soil organisms propagate in these pots. And yeah, and for the, for the reduced soil life treatment, we filtered the soil through 11 micrometer filters and also added this to sterile soil in the greenhouse. So we had both treatments growing in the greenhouse and in sterile substrate and only a small part of, of the two filtrates was added. So we tried to really make sure that, that, yeah, the difference are similar, except for the different organisms present. So we tried to do that. Okay. And another part of the question was, where do you, where do the microbes come from and how much did you apply? So we, we went to a agricultural fields, like a pasture field here close to our research station from a farmer and yeah, use just native soil organisms we found in that soil. and then we, what was the second part of the question? I have to, I'm already, the second part, one moment. Yeah, how much did you apply? Yeah. So we produced this inoculum in the greenhouse and then I think we, if I remember correctly, it was about 10 percent of the soil volume in this lysometers was um was the inoculum from the greenhouse or maybe it was five percent or so of the volume i'm not sure right now i would have to look it up thank you uh a little interruption um i want to remind everybody you don't have to do it now but all the participants uh you have to refresh the browser because otherwise we will drop out by five i mean maybe there will be maybe we will be finished by five but maybe it take a little bit longer we just that it's not like a really quick and so maybe you just refresh the browser uh when you have time within the next uh five minutes okay and um i would continue with the questions michaela she's asking is intensive cropping always combined with bad soil life or is intensive range from overuse like the degraded soils from us to special used cropping systems with crop rotation and cover crops um yeah i've probably there's also intensively managed systems where soil life is doing well i think there's a lot of factors that play a role and it's always difficult to make these generalizations and we also saw on the data that there's a huge variability in the data so some cropping systems are doing better than than others um and i didn't i don't remember the rest of the question yeah so yeah is it um or is it in intensive range from overuse to special use cropping systems with crop rotation and cover crops that's like the second part of the um of the question yeah uh so i think probably if i understand correctly if there's like a gradient of of um yeah soil soil health from from more sustainably to more intensively managed systems um which i would say yes so you you can't cannot really put them in categories so this is good this is bad or the soil life is good good here and bad there so it's it's really a gradient and it really depends on on lots of details that we also don't understand understand at this point i guess okay thank you uh ruta she's asking who paid about sending back soil samples t-backs and pants participants or your organization uh yeah actually the university of zurich was kind enough to sponsor the shipment um so we sent the packages already with a return shipment label they just have to have to put on the on the box and they could use the same box so we tried to make it really easy for the participants to return the shipments another question by marian which results would you think the lysometer trials had shown if also slurry had been added um yeah that's a difficult question i don't yeah i don't know i think i i would guess that um in general they they would have probably gone in a similar direction but um yeah i i can't really say a lot about this okay and then was the question about this uh how the soil was sterilized and how was it ensured that it was sterile yeah yeah yeah but i answered this already right yeah yeah that's that that's the thing like because it was not um it's not showed like that it was answered but it was already okay answered right yeah so um actually all questions in the chat are answered now so um the final question is you know it may be already what are the two uh main take home messages or the or one two things you want to share with us before you or we leave the participants by five we try um yeah i i think my main message is um make taking care of your soil a priority um it's really the the basis of human existence and then also of the functioning of planet earth so we really have to take care of the soil and uh get away from only focusing on yields but really focusing on feeding the soil and keeping it healthy and alive so that we um can rely on them also in 100 years from now okay um thank you very much wow we are on time thank you france
