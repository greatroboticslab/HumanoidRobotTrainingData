 All right, so I'm going to show you my work area here. You'll see here that we have the buckets of the things that we just sorted from the car. These are our different colored cloths that we brought in. And as soon as I sort them from today, then I just throw them inside these buckets. And then at the end of the week, I put some cleaning solution in there and I soak all of the junk off of the cloths. And then I run an individual load of each of those. Up here, I do have my OxiClean, which is what I soak the aprons and the uniforms in. As we go up here, I have some special kits. And then over here, we have our personal protective equipment. And that is every kit gets some personal protective equipment, but we let the individual house cleaners check those out. We have our shoe covers. We have our garbage bags. And this is the stuff that we need to pack our kits. And then over here, we have our empty bottles. And these will be the bottles that we restock tonight's supplies with. And so that is the setup that we have here. And like I said, this is an operation that will run probably one to three, one to four people. And this is before you need to scale and consider a bigger place. Yeah. So, what was I like? So, how does the garbage lad do you need to do? That stuff does. So, how does the garbage I use? So, how do you do? That stuff does? So, how do I work? And this is going to do with the�니다 of technology. So, how do I work? So, how do I work with your garden Josh Silver? So, how do I work with my garden?
