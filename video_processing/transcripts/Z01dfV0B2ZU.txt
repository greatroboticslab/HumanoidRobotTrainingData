Education
 David Trinkline, University of Missouri Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Everyone, welcome to the afternoon sessions of the Farmers Forum. My name is David Trinkline, I'm on the faculty of the Plant Sciences Unit at the University of Missouri. It's my pleasure to moderate the first three hours worth of sessions. To begin with, I would like to introduce my colleague, Dr. Sanjen Gu, who is State Vegetable Extension Specialist as well as a faculty member at Lincoln University in Jefferson City. Before Dr. Gu arrived in Missouri, I don't think many Missourians at least heard of the concept of vegetable grafting, much less tomato grafting. Since his arrival, it's been kind of a standard best management practice and today he's going to give us an update on some of the research he's been carried out in grafting. Dr. Gu. Thank you, Dave. Please report to the small part today. I gave one presentation before, I mean this morning for the seminar and let me get this started. This morning I talked about, hold on, let me move to the other one. You can see the outline over there, this for today, whole day. So this morning I talked about the introduction part and what, why, and then we talk about how. And this afternoon I'm going to talk about my research at the Lincoln University. Before you, before we start, for those who were not able to make to my presentation, I do have a handouts, which is actually our newsletter, articles, and my two assistants, Sean and Catherine, to distribute them to you. There should be two, and there should be three articles, but I'm still working on the third one. So the first one is introduction about the vegetable grafting. The second one is about the tomato grafting. This morning I discussed in detail about how to do grafting in general, not only for tomatoes, but also for pepper, for, for, uh, eggplants, for watermelon, cucumber, and the cucurbit stuff. So if you are interested in my presentation, uh, send me an email so I can send you a PDF version. Um, so, um, just give you a pre-warning, this afternoon's talk will be my research update, and it will be really dry. So you'll see a lot of figures in the graphic stuff, so it's not going to be so colorful with pictures like this morning. And also, um, I wasn't able to get all the data analyzed for this year. Um, we, we made some mistake there by not including the controls. So, so the result will be primarily from last year. But, um, uh, you, you'll find what, uh, we did last year. So, how many of you have, uh, attended my seminar this morning? Okay, um, so how many of you think you are very confident with, uh, grafting part already? One hand, two hand, three hands, pretty good. So, like I said, today, and this afternoon will be a research update. I will not give you a lot of information about the general, general, uh, grafting technology stuff. Uh, it will be just some research. Okay. Okay. Again, my name is San Jun, and San Jun Gu, I'm with Lincoln University Extension. Uh, I have been, with, uh, been in Missouri for almost five, five years now. Time, time just passes fast. Okay. Um, what we did last year, we did two research, at least, two research projects. Number one is the grafting compatibility study with heirloom tomatoes. Because when I introduced the idea to our farmers about, uh, tomato grafting, they always ask me questions. Whether, you know, if I have an heirloom, can I just go try them? You know, do you have any research data to see what it's gonna take? Because you put two things together, there's a good chance it will not take. So, that's the reason behind this research. Of course, people are interested in, uh, in, uh, high tunnel, uh, or field heirloom tomato production, especially for organic or, or, or, or for farmers markets. Um, so, that's why I did this research. And, uh, um, for those who, those of you who don't really know about, uh, grafting yet, um, I can tell you some advantage. Number one, you'll have a, uh, disease, especially soil-borne disease resistance, because of the rootstock. And number two, uh, if you choose a good rootstock, you usually have a enhanced vigor, and your yield usually be enhanced, to be increased. Uh, and also, uh, uh, high tunnel has been getting popular, and we use high tunnel for season extension, especially in winter, uh, in early fall, or, uh, early spring, or later spring. So, we want to catch maybe two more months' time to produce more warm-seeding vegetables, as well as some of the cold-seeding vegetables. So, grafting, uh, with correct rootstock, you do enhance your sign-on, uh, cold-heartedness. So, just some background information for you. Okay, um, for this research, what we did, uh, this is just introduction part. We don't have to go through this again. Um, what we did last year, we choose about 21, uh, heirloom tomatoes, and, uh, we grafted them onto rootstocks, uh, Beaufort and a Maxifort. So, we used the tubing grafting method. We tried all those, uh, heirloom tomatoes. You can see some of them, like a Kentucky beefsteak, brandy wine, uh, pink heart. I like this one, actually. So, what we did briefly, we used the tubing method. This shows you how you do it. And for those of you who went to my talk this morning, it should look familiar. Uh, this picture was from, uh, those pictures were from Dr. Uh, Revert from Kansas State University. And basically, what you do, you grow your, your rootstock, and your sign on the similar size. You cut your rootstock, uh, either before or above, or up, uh, below, uh, over the cutting landings. I prefer this one because later you don't have to remove suckers. And put a tube on it. This is called a tube grafting method because the tubes were designed specifically for this method. And, uh, you slide this tube in and then you cut your sign on, different angle, 45 degree. And you slide this in, make sure the two surfaces contact each other. And that'd be it. Of course, later you have to move into a growth chamber to, to heal them. Um, so basically, for this, uh, uh, acclimation process, for day one, two, three, you keep to close to 100% darkness and close to 100% humidity. And that's, after three days, you slowly reduce darkness and, uh, keep relatively high humidity. And then after seven to ten days, they are as normal if they take. Uh, one last thing I learned from this year was, uh, the temperature, even though it's not listed here, the temperature plays very important role in the survival. Uh, I guess, um, you don't want to keep your temperature before 80 degree Fahrenheit. And, uh, uh, room temperature will be actually very nice. Uh, the story was, for, for my, my observation was before a meeting, um, I grafted something for some kids. And, uh, I just dropped them in my office. And then they came back seven days later, they all survived without any cover. So that gave me the hint that the temperature is very, very critical. Uh, my office temperature in summertime is about 70 degree or lower. So, the, this survived really well. And the humidity maybe just less than 50. So keep that in mind. Okay, um, we did the greenhouse research. This is my growth chamber. We did just build some frame and cover with some plastic. That's it. Uh, I do have a, uh, household, a human fire inside. Uh, this is just show you the picture of the grafted, uh, uh, transplant. And those are survived transplants. So those are greenhouse study. Uh, I grafted them and to see, uh, the survival, whether they are successful or not. So here's the result. Like I said, it's all graphic stuff. And this is my heirloom variety. And this is my survival rate, rate with one is 100%. So this is on Beaufort. The Rootstock Beaufort. You can see the lowest one is the browning one red. It's actually not too bad, 80%. By the way, I grafted all this by myself. It took me a lot of time. So most of them close to 100% thick. So it was really, really good. And, uh, for Maxifort, however, I did see some difference. And, uh, you can see this, uh, mortgage lifter and, uh, uh, I don't even know how to read this. The A55, they were particularly low. I tried to find out why, uh, it was this low. I guess I probably was just too tired. I don't know. So, uh, however, if you see the statistics, you see, even those 90% on Beaufort's survival and the 72% on Maxifort, uh, by, uh, the, uh, statistical analysis, they are not significantly different. So even though there are some exceptions there, uh, we will see in general, uh, there's not, there was not, at least in the greenhouse, uh, setting incompatibility issue. So, which means you can graft them, they can take really well, and they can grow. And then, whether they're gonna be okay in the field or not, we don't know. Because earlier, just like, uh, just like the, uh, uh, the grapes, you graft them, they look really well, you plant them. Some of them, you know, they, they will die or slowly reduce the vigor after 10, 15 years. So, we did the greenhouse study just to see whether grafting is successful or not. And then we planted them in the field to test them in a real, uh, environment, especially, uh, in the open field. And last year was a good year to test because it was hot and dry. Uh, so we, we planted those successfully, uh, survived, uh, grafted transplants in the field. This is how we did it in the open field. It was really dry. And we, we measured the growth and yield. Um, yield data is not available yet, I believe. Because last year, we just didn't have tomatoes until later in the growing season. And when the weather was cold, and we harvested a lot of green tomatoes, not, not red ones. So, we, we measured the, uh, stem diameter, and then we measured the stem diameter above and below the graft union, trying to find, uh, uh, index to see, uh, to measure the, uh, compatibility. So, so here's one picture showing this, uh, brand new wine pink, grafted on Beaufort. You can see the roots. And, uh, here's graft union, here's graft union, here's graft union. And some of the plants that we actually planted maybe too, too deep. Uh, however, you don't see a lot of roots growing out above the graft union, you know, which was okay. We don't want any roots come out from, from the scion part. Okay, um, I split this, this is graft union. And, uh, you see the picture here. Uh, you do see, uh, kind of a diagonal line here showing the graft union. But even though it's here showing this. So, this one is non-grafted. You see, visually, you don't see a lot of difference. So, which means they, they do really well. If you see the, the connection here, this is the scion, this is your rootstock. There's no obvious stop, stop there, even though you can see something there. So, I draw a line there just to show the graft union over there. And for stem diameter, we always tell people that if by choosing a good rootstock, uh, your growth, your scion growth vigor can be enhanced. So, we measure the stem diameter. You can see, on Beaufort or Maxifort, all those stems were bigger than the non-graphic control. So, with that show the difference on the, on your, on the thickness of your, your, your stem. That's one way to see, uh, you have a enhanced vigor. Uh, then for the diameter ratio, above and below, of course, non-graphic will be zero. I mean, it will be one. And for Beaufort and Maxifort, the graph union actually did something to the plant. So, above the graph union is a little bit thicker than the lower one. Even though, visually, by your bare eyes, you don't see the difference. If you measure, we measure them with the caliber, you actually see the difference. So, we do see some difference over there. And the conclusion here is, um, um, um, well, here's, uh, uh, well, this is about, uh, the, the greenhouse trial. Uh, we had better luck with Maxifort than Beaufort. And then, we know, I just said that we had a bigger or thicker, uh, stems for the graphed ones. So, the most important, uh, conclusion for this part is, uh, a grafting compatibility seemed not to be an issue. So, at least in the tested, uh, uh, 21 varieties. So, if you have a heirloom tomato, I, I'm, I'm thinking, I'm brought, uh, maybe 90% sure you will not have that. Incompatibility if you, for, for, for, uh, uh, tomatoes. You know, the reason incompatibility is so important, uh, just because, uh, if you think about it, you do graft, you graft, uh, watermelon or cucumber or melon. You know, if you add some bitterness to your watermelon, I don't think people will like it. But for tomatoes, I don't think it's a big challenge. So, um, then again, that, that year, we, we did some, uh, um, uh, uh, heirloom trial with graft, with grafting in the high tunnels. And, uh, we, I have two high tunnels. One is double layer poly, uh, the other one is single layer poly. So, we did some research on that. And, uh, the, with some, uh, what we wanna do to find out, um, uh, uh, if grafting will enhance the heirloom tomato production in high tunnels. And, uh, number two, to find out whether a single layer versus, uh, uh, double layer poly will do some different, uh, do something to the heirloom tomatoes, especially grafted ones in the high tunnels. And, uh, I, I placed one sentence here. Tomato grafting in the high tunnel could be a perfect combination. Uh, the reading behind that, you know, people started to do, uh, high tunnels, uh, very largely because the NRCS got involved. They got, they got, they got involved with, uh, the cost share program. So, we have seen a lot high tunnels everywhere almost in the Midwest. So, when people try to use new high tunnels, they don't have, uh, at least, uh, they don't, maybe just beginners like, I don't know. But, their soil is kinda new. They don't have a lot of soil-borne disease problems. But, in the future, since high tunnel is, uh, a little bit cost, costly to build, to maintain, and they give you more money. So, you tend to produce more of your cash crop, like tomatoes. And, the rotation is limited in the high tunnel. And, you want to plant, you want to apply more manures or compost. So, sooner or later, your soil disease will build up. Your soil salinity may, may, may, may build up, if you're not careful enough. So, by doing that, you cause a lot of trouble for your production. And then, and you cannot use methambromide anymore, because it's banned for its, uh, environment to damage. So, you cannot use, uh, fumigants to do that. The new one may not be, uh, as well as the one we used before, like, mesmerbromide. Or, they may have some environmental issue as well. Or, simply because you're organic, or all natural farmer, you don't want to do anything with that. So, but doing hype, doing, but, but adapting the grafting technology, you can avoid those, uh, fumigation part. So, that's what we did. We do the two cyan variety. We have ananas and the German pink, two big fruit, uh, type of variety. Um, pretty good quality. And, uh, we graft them into Beaufort, and Peridore, and Maxifort. So, this year, I wasn't able to find this variety. And, for some reason, seed companies don't carry over, uh, seeds over years anymore. I don't know why, but, so I couldn't find this one. Uh, for Roostock, I have a, uh, Beaufort and this. And for the combinations, for German pink, I do have a self-grafted German pink as control. I have a non-grafted, grafted on itself as control, but for ananas, I didn't have enough seeds. So, that's the, uh, uh, combination of grafted, grafted tomatoes. And, um, I can tell you I didn't take this picture. I didn't, really. Um, it's a little fuzzy, but this is German pink. And, uh, this is ananas nor. It's very tasty variety. Um, same thing with you, the tubing grafting method. We graft in the greenhouse. Last year, we were late. So, we planted them in May. Usually, we will, you know, in this area, we will plant them in the high tunnel. Late week of March or early April. But, we were late. Uh, we were not getting the seeds in time. For some reason, the seed company agreed to send me the seeds. They forgot to do it. So, anyhow. And then, the first batch of, um, the, the grafted, grafted stuff, uh, uh, they were killed with one weekend. Uh, my, I guess my technician was not on campus. And the student worker didn't do a good job. They just, they just cooked. And when they were in the chamber. So, in the greenhouse with the sunny light, with black stuff on it, they were killed. So, um, people ask me, did you fire, fire your, uh, student worker? I said, no, I didn't. I gave, gave him another chance. Uh, no story. So, this is my high tunnel, 30 by 96, uh, with rich vent. And, uh, this is single layer. This is double layer. It's, uh, it's a, it's a, the man's brand. And remember, we're in zone 5B. And, uh, like I said, we splanned them late. And then, we ran right into this heat, uh, uh, weather. So, for quite a few while, we didn't have a, uh, we didn't have a harvest because it was too hot. But, however, we kept them there. We kept them going until later fall. So, uh, we do have some data for last year. And this is how my plants look like. I do have an automated system to, to drop the curtain down and up. And also, a controller to control the ridge vent. So, I had a pretty good system, um, to automatically manipulate my temperature. Just because I cannot be there every day. Neither did my technician. So, you know, this is, uh, when I was preparing this talk yesterday, um, I used one previous presentation. I have a, the extreme hot and dry summer in 2011. But it wasn't true anymore. This year was even bad. So, I removed that word. But still tells you, you know, in late June to, to almost the early part of August, we have a really, really, to this part as well, really bad, uh, weather. And we know that, uh, I think I have another line here. You know, pretty much here, 75, uh, you see the plant growth for tomatoes get influenced. About 97, I think pollination will, will stop. And there's about 120, 102 degree, the whole plant may just, may just not grow. So, this is especially true for, uh, for heirloom tomatoes, which primarily is just indeterminate. So, you can see I do have some heat tolerant varieties there. Unfortunately, this is my variety trial part. That's not the, the grafted part. But other just like this for a long time. No fruit. Because pollination was, was impossible. So, we do see some temperature difference between the two high tunnels. The single layer versus double layer. Basically, in the early, early in the morning, well, in the morning, the, the single layer has a higher temperature. And then the night, the night, you, you have double layer at the higher temperature. This is May. Uh, and then the PR is the photosynthetic activity radiation. You see the difference between the two, uh, layer system, you know, in the high tunnels. So, if you, um, if you think about, um, maintaining the heat in a high tunnel, you may think about, uh, using double layer. But, uh, in the, in zone 6B or above, I don't think it's necessary. Just give you some, um, environmental factors there to help explain the, uh, explain the result. So, for the yield, this is single layer. You have a, we have a green, uh, German pink, German pink, on German pink, and then on three rootstocks. You see, pretty much similar. From, uh, August here, basically, you don't have, I didn't have any harvest. And then we, I do have a, some harvest starting in the late, uh, well, early part of October until, uh, the frost came. Well, not a frost, the freeze temperature came in. Um, I was actually in Pennsylvania for a meeting where my technician students are harvesting those tomatoes. So, you see, really, you don't see a lot of big difference. For double layer, you do, you do see some difference here. For this one, the green line is, uh, German pink on Beaufort. And we always see the, the maxi fort, where you, uh, transfer the most vigor to your sion. But, uh, under that, this condition, you know, if it is so hot, Beaufort is less vigorous variety, uh, uh, roostock variety actually didn't, did better than others. And, uh, for this one, you can see the non-graphic one, overall performed the worst. So, we still see some difference in double layer polys. For, for, for the, uh, ananas, you see the, the similar trend, but you don't see a lot of big difference here. So, for the double layer, uh, this one's, on this imperador, roostock did a little bit better than others, similar to this one. So, if put a thing together, for, uh, for the ananas, German pink, we see varied difference, uh, between, uh, the roostock treatments, you know, different roostock and cyan combinations. For example, this one, the double layer seemed to be better for this one as well, but others may not. So, so, it varies, depends on the variety. But for ananas, the other variety, you see the double layer did better. So, we do see the difference between the two type of high tunnels when you graft those tomatoes. Uh, so, this is result, you know, generally speaking, I don't see a lot of difference between the grafted ones and non-grafted ones. Even though, for, for, uh, I think for, for ananas nor, uh, one roostock variety performed better. And, uh, we see the difference, you know, the, the non-grafted tend to be lower yield. But, uh, because the heat last year, it didn't show the potential difference. So, I cannot see the significantly different. Um, and, but in the field, in, in, in the, in the greenhouse, I did see that, uh, the grafted ones were more vigorous. Here is the area of the soil temperature was different between the single double layer high tunnels. So, basically, the take home message for you is, uh, uh, grafting can enhance vigor, number one. Number two, uh, the double layer will be better. And the weather, you know, the, in three, for whether the, the grafting has a benefit or advantage on this trial, uh, you know, I cannot tell you. But this year, we may have a better result. However, well, this year, we tried the same variety on sign on different roostock, one, two, three, four, five. However, we, when I was trying to analyze data, found out the control, uh, were not included there. I mean, we were, data were there, but it were, for the arranged data, were not there. So, it wasn't able to do the stats analysis, the statistic analysis. So, I'll present the data probably at, uh, the Great Plains Conference in January. And also gonna post the results on our website. So, you get this sooner or later. Okay, um, this is just a quick update. And again, this is just a result, a research result. I think I have a couple minutes for questions. Yes. I saw where you're doing melons and cucumbers. Has anybody done this? Or is it, does cantaloupe fall in the same category as watermelons? Uh, yeah. Is it a small, purple-sized cantaloupe? Yeah, his question is, um, um, whether people have been doing research or, or, or demonstration with, uh, cucurbit stuff like watermelons, cucumbers. Um, I haven't done this yet. I have collected, uh, uh, three cucumber, uh, uh, rootstock varieties which can also be used for watermelon and melon. So, I'm gonna do some research with cucumber, the English cucumber type this year. Uh, Dr. Xin Zhao from University of Florida. She's been doing, uh, melon cantaloupe grafting study. And, uh, there's another USDA guy doing watermelon. So, there's a big, uh, specialty crop research initiative grant. Um, it is looking at different aspects of grafting. So, uh, that grant started last year. I'm, uh, I'm assuming results will start to come out next year. But, in China, they graft all watermelons and, uh, cucumbers. And, uh, cucumbers and melons in the, uh, uh, in the greenhouse and high tunnel settings. So, they're doing? They are doing great. Yeah. Similar to cucumbers. It's a similar process as melons and cucumbers. Yes. Yes. For, for all cucurbits, the grafting message will be similar. And, uh, the result may vary because if you're talking about watermelon and the melon, you're talking about the sugar content. So, the sometimes if you're not careful and choose the wrong variety, the, uh, the quality may be, may be reduced. However, the research done by USD people with watermelon, we found out, uh, you know, if you graft them, it enhance the shelf life. Other questions? Other questions? Other questions? Um, what about as far as, like, other online resources with, you know, uh, you know, uh, the in-depth, uh, specifics of grafting, and planting schedule, and that kind of thing? Is there, like, any more, like, online resources or books that you might suggest for vegetable grafting in general? Um, there are quite a few publications for farmers, it's extension publications. Um, there are some research projects as well. Uh, I know in, in, in, in heart science, in heart technology, there are some publications on grafted tomatoes. And there is a review in heart science on grafted, uh, watermelons and other cucurbits. So, uh, our, I don't know how good you are with, uh, scientific journal, but at least you can try, if you wanna, you wanna do the, uh, scholar.google.com, uh, you can get a lot of scientific information there. Since then, it'll be worth it, honey. If you have any kind along, like, other material ingredients, and that I should admit there is a algoch there in therow, I like Golden marrow. The, of the world where a major world that unleashes with wouldn't bereteionsane, right,ugucalled deuxième little unlucky。。 dirigents. The name of my brother and Ièmes is in the future that I became Luca, took noticeably nice!! The bookstore, ensued myself, in, like, with aART color, ended up in remote route. And it's, like, first, that it's the full 2018-еamp, and the first, like, that a teenager. Thank you.
