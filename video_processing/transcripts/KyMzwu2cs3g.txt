 Guys, welcome back. Today we're going to use an ideal 48-inch tiller. You can see right here in a previous video, we used an all-purpose plow, three passes down and back. This is the finished results. We're going to compare those results versus the results of a tiller. This is the same day, all right? So we went and hooked this up right afterwards. I'm going to go down and back, see the results with one pass compared to three passes. If needed, we'll go down and back again. And I think I'm going to run this tiller over top of what I plowed already. That's just not a good enough result for me there to want to plant in. So I'm going to finish that out, smooth it out for a good seed bed before we seed later this spring. Now you guys know I'm a big fan of dirt dog equipment, but dirt dog does not offer a four foot tiller. So something for your subcompact tractors, the 1025R, Kubota BX, anything in that smallest footprint of modern day tractors. So the 48-inch that we offered this year is by Ideal Farm Equipment. So this is going to be similar to the dirt dog, that it is a made in the USA with some foreign or imported components like the gearbox, for example. So we're trying to get away from the made in China stuff whenever possible. Last year you saw us running Tar River tillers and land planes, and it was kind of our last season with them for a number of reasons. So we're switching over to more North American made companies is the gist of it. So this Ideal Tiller is going to be four foot wide. It's going to have a slip clutch on it. Something that I actually noticed I don't see very often is just basically slip clutch maintenance or almost like a checklist over here on the sticker. So that's kind of nice to see too. So we'll have similar features, what you expect, what you want to see on a tiller. So I've got the gearbox up here. This is gear driven on the side. It's not going to be chain driven. I like that a little bit more robust, I believe. Swing gate on the back with this chain, so you can adjust that. Swing your gate open if you want to or not. You're going to have a parking stand over on this far side. Now this has four blades per flange, and the thought process I think with Ideal is that you're going to put less strain on a subcompact tractor versus a six blades per flange. So we'll be able to see if there's a difference in performance as we're chilling today. But something interesting is that on the flanges themselves that the blades bolt onto, there's extra holes on there. There's four extra holes. You have two bolts per flange. So potentially you could stagger in a different way, add another flange or two more. Wow, look at them geese. That's a flock. So what I was saying was that on the flanges underneath here, right now you have four blades per flange, but there's extra holes in those flanges. So there's four extra holes total, which would equate to a total of two extra blades. So I almost feel like you could potentially add more blades onto each flange if you wanted to, but we'll check out the performance with four blades, see how it does, and we can make a determination from there. A couple more features you might be interested in. This whole plate that you see down here kind of underneath the housing is adjustable up and down. So you have multiple bolt holes, so you can adjust this kind of skid runner to help out with your depth. And speaking of max depth, it is up to a seven inch tilling depth, which is typically unheard of on a four foot tiller. I don't really see the need to go seven inches down, but it's nice to know you can. And of course, if you didn't notice, this is quick hitch compatible. We're using the Spico Cat 1 Quick Hitch. This one does not use any bushings, all right? So we sell an absolute boatload of these things for that very reason, but you don't have to use a quick hitch. If you want to just hook it right up to your category one three-point hitch, you can do that as well. It's standard 540 RPM rear PTO. Just got the PTO shaft. Hook it up right to the back of your tractor. Have the safety chains, the shaft cover, all that good stuff too. Now something that's mentioned on this sticker on this side and maybe somewhere else as well. And just for your general information, most gearboxes these days are coming empty without any oil in there. Maybe there's just a trace film just to kind of coat the inside of the gearbox, but that's due to different shipping regulations, federal regulations that limit or don't allow at all any fluids to be shipped. And so that's the reason behind that. So it's always a good idea to check your gearboxes before you get to work. And speaking of work, we're going to get to it right now. As always, we're sponsored by Bora Wheel Spacers. They are made in America, have a lifetime warranty. If your tractor feels tippy side to side, especially if you have a cab on it, then adding a set of wheel spacers can make a big difference.

Technically, I'm probably a little early on my tilling. We're going to come back through and plant our screening cover that we have. It's a giant screen. It'll grow up to, it's over 12 foot tall in one season. You can plant it even in June and still get, I think it's over 10 foot in height. It's a crazy cool type of plant that you can get. And so we're actually a new dealer with Northwoods Whitetails who sells this product along with all sorts of food plot seeds too. So we're going to plant plots all over this place this year, get the screening cover here, closer to the road, a lot of different areas. So access to stands, that kind of thing too. Going to have a lot of fun. So if you want to see what's going on out here at the property, see more tractor videos in general, we'd love to have you tag along, hit that subscribe button.
