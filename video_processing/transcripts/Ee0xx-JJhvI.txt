 What are your thoughts on sustainability and the kind of sustainability movement in agriculture? How would you kind of frame that up? Well, that's a great question because I'm also on the Texas Peanut Producers Board, and I'm on a couple of committees that do sustainability now. So it's so creative where ag's been. You know, we used to do all chemical fertilizers, and even on my operation now, we do a lot of manure or compost. My son actually does a lot of compost where we don't do any kind of natural fertilizer. So we spread three to four tons on our peanuts, which that's a sustainability issue is chemical fertilizers, you know, and we use them on our organics down here also, you know, our compost.
