Howto & Style
 What's up YouTube and welcome back to the channel. Today we have an issue with the New Holland and the issue is water in the hydraulic lines. So I'm going to show you how to drain the reservoir and to flush the lines without removing the skid plate underneath and also show you one of the main reasons for this problem. So stay tuned and let's get it started. So to confirm we do have water in the line. If you remove your dipstick you will notice that it is white and milky. And you can see that it is contaminated with water. So what we are going to do is we are going to remove the dipstick here and we are going to drain the tank by cycling out the oil from the tank. So the first thing you want to do is get as much of the contaminated oil out as possible. So the first thing we are going to do is remove the dipstick. And we are going to siphon everything out through here. Like I said you can see definitely contaminated. So once you get your dipstick removed what you want to do is what I use is a small pump. You can get these cheap pretty much anywhere and it hooks to your battery. I am going to connect it. I am going to put it into the reservoir. And the other end we are going to put it into the bucket. Boosting Tide If it is organic... Let the steel keep the carbon. So I am going to see here of this thing. Thank you. Steve. Yes, please. so oh oh we're gonna pop this out into you it stops so that'll be your first step is to get everything pumped out so one of the main reasons that this particular brand gets water in the reservoir is on the cap if you notice the inside you'll notice that there's a filter which if it's not in the right place it will let water seep through these holes and enter in and the other reason is around here if you notice how this is designed as water comes in or it rains it should run off to side here but over time there's a gasket under here and if that gasket goes out water accumulates here and it just drains down into the tank so normally I keep this covered up but unfortunately I didn't get it covered up and we had a lot of rain so I knew that was the problem so I'm gonna take this off and check the gasket also and possibly make another gasket and put silicone in here so those are your two reasons one double check make sure you have the filter in here which is that inside and then the other reason check to see if your gasket is worn out around here if it has then just take this off and put in a new gasket or put silicone around it and I'm going to show you how to prevent that in the future okay so as you can see this gasket is in pretty bad shape so that could be the culprit and underneath which is here it should actually be another gasket here that seals around here and don't know if it's just missing or in bad shape but you can see definitely water so that's our main culprit so another thing you can do is you can pick up a pump like this which is inexpensive and that'll help speed up everything while you're pumping with the electric motor but so far the reservoir holds six and a half gallons and so far we've pumped out about three and a half so that's the first section we're going to go and empty that and start back pumping again and once you get everything emptied out we're going to refill the reservoir and go out and run it and then we're going to open up the cylinder line to see if we're getting clean fluid up front so let's get it filled up it will finish something. so these three changes are through. it'll be safe. start listening to you first first the ½ 100 Once you refill it, because you're going to have to flush the lines, you're going to see how much is in here. So we're going to take this line to lose, put your bone in the up position. So we're just trying to get as much out of the lines as possible before we refill it again for any free blessing. So you're going to loosen this as well. So, let's go. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So once it's running clear with just hydraulic fluid, we're going to shake the other lines, operate the machine, and then come back and re-bleed the lines again. So one of the� so and to flush your auxiliary lines which we're going to do last because i hadn't used it so it should be good fluid in here in order to keep from breaking those lines you basically just take your plug you're going to plug here and take up from that plug there and then we'll let it bleed out from here but this should have these lines should have good fluid through them because i hadn't operated those but we got those bled and now let's go operate the machine and come back and refill the reservoir and bleed it again all right puppy slow all right stop stop it keep coming keep going all right so we got the system bled out and all the water out the line we're going to bleed it one more time and then we'll come back and bleed with the auxiliary lines but what i did is for the purpose of the video i just showed you what comes out of the lines actually took a line and connected it to the plug and then just ran the other end of the line into a bucket and just pumped it out that way. Like I said, by the purpose of the video, just wanted to show you what comes out of the line as we blend each line and then just connect the line to it and just continue to bleed it until you empty your bucket and then you get clear fluid running out into the bucket. But like I said, we'll bleed the system one more time and then we'll come back and leave the hydraulic lines just to make sure everything gets good. So the process is to make sure you keep enough oil in the system so when you're bleeding it, you don't affect your pump. So I have the fluid pumping into the system and once it reaches its proper level, we're going to go ahead and start bleeding it and so like I said, I got the holes running into a bucket and we'll go ahead and bleed this front line. here is the next setup. We're going to bleed this side and we got it going into our bucket. We got the bucket empty. Now we're going to bleed this side. So we got our setup. Cob centimetre with more rechargeable��가 We're going to do the same thing to drain all our delivery lines. We're going to do the same thing to do. We're going to do the same thing to do. We're going to do so. so this will be the third flush of the auxiliary line no water in the line but the fluid was dark so i'm gonna drain them until we can get clear fluid so let's see if this one will do it so this is the third flush so so Once you got all your lines bled and your hydraulic fluid filled back to the right level, the next step is to come around the back and you're going to change your hydraulic filter. So we'll take that out and change that filter. And then next you can see the gasket which was in pretty bad shape but the gasket goes beneath here and then another one is here sandwiched between the filler cap. So you're going to put your gaskets there and then make sure you put silicone, add silicone or RTV silicone to it and then on both spots sandwich it in, put your screws back in and then to prevent it from happening again we're gonna go down here and make sure you have a gasket here but you want to put silicone around that and then seal this back in that way water doesn't get in. And then for the top to prevent water you're going to take just a regular plastic container, you're going to cut the top off of it and place it over the top and then as your cap go down as your cover go down it'll hold it so that way it won't pop off while you're working or anything and you won't forget to put it back on. So that's what we'll get taken care of next. So this is one way to flush your entire hydraulic system and to remove all the contaminated oil out of the system it took me about 20 gallons to flush the entire system and that's including the hydraulic lines. If you're just using this process to change your oil the whole system takes about six and a half gallons so if you're just changing your oil you won't use as much. So once we got all the contaminated oil out the next thing we did is you have a filter that's in here and you have gaskets that's around there. You want to make sure both of those are good. In our case our gaskets were bad so those are special order gaskets so in that case you may want to order those in advance. So what I did is just made two and put those around and then put silicone there. Make sure your filter, breather filter is good because you'll get water in from here and that's where the cover comes in and just make this out of a simple container and cover it up and that'll eliminate water going through the breather and then you want to put silicone around the base of the dipstick and that way you won't get water in there and then finally you want to make sure you change the hydraulic filter and once you've done that that should take care of all your problems as far as water getting in through your reservoir.
