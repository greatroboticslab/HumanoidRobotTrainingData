 So like any crop, Caranata harvests energy from the sun, carbon dioxide from the air, water from the soil, and that allows it to create yield for us to use, but it also returns carbon into the soil, sequestering it there so that it's permanently in the soil or it's available for a future crop to use. Our goal with the growing system of Caranata is to grow Caranata in situations where you normally wouldn't have a crop. So it's a non-food acre, an acre where nothing would be growing. Caranata goes in that place, harvests that energy from the sun, harvests CO2 from the air, creates yield for us to create biofuels, other oil type products, and also returns carbon into the soil making it a net negative carbon crop.
