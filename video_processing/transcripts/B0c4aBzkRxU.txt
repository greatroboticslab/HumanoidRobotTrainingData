Again, thank you all for joining us. And I'm going to turn this webinar over to Lisa. Well, good evening. Thank you all for joining us. Our speakers tonight, all of us as specialists, are dealing with many of the same winter management issues and challenges that you are. And so please feel free to ask questions. I was asked to talk about assessing cow and bull condition and managing bulls in a tough winter situation. And so the first thing I'm going to talk about is body condition scoring. This is a really nice three-step system for body condition scoring. First, I'd encourage you to look at the ribs of the cow or the bull. That's denoted by number one on your screen. If you can see those last two ribs, that animal is in a body condition score less than five. If those last two ribs are not visible, that animal is in a body condition score of five or greater. Next, we would encourage you to look at the spine. That's denoted by number two here on the cow. If that spine is visible, the animal is in a body condition score of three or less. Next, look at the shape between the hooks and the pins. In the dairy industry, we call that area of the thorough. If that animal has a strong V shape in that area, that animal is in a body condition score of two. If it's a strong V but a little more flat, that would be a body condition score of three. A V shape would be a body condition score of four. And then as we move into a U shape in that area, it would be a body condition score of five. And as we move into a flatter shape, those move into body condition scores six, seven, and eight. In the United States, our beef body condition scores range from a one to a nine. A body condition score one is considered a cowl bull that is starved, very emaciated. And a body condition score nine is considered an animal that is obese. So let's look at body condition scoring. We would like to see our animals in a body condition score five to seven at calving time. Those are the two body condition scores on the right side of the screen here. So we'd like our mature cows to be in a body condition score five. Again, we are not able to see those last two ribs. The spine is not available. It's not visible, excuse me. And the shape between the hooks and the pins is in a strong U shape. And so you can see that this cow, the top on the right hand side is in a body condition score five. The cow below her, we cannot see those last two ribs. The spine is not visible. And the shape between her hooks and pins is very flat. And so she's in a body condition score of six or greater. Now, why do we talk about this? Well, for every body condition score you lose, you lose between 80 and 100 pounds of weight. It takes a great deal of energy and cost to get cows up in that, to increase body condition score at calving or right before breeding. And so we really are concerned about body condition score. There's a lot of impact on calf health and calf productivity along with cow productivity. We tend to forget about bulls when we manage in the wintertime. And we certainly forget about looking at our body condition scores of bulls. So these are two bulls. The bull on the left is a body condition score five. Again, just like our cows, we cannot see his last two ribs. We cannot see his spine. And that shape between his hooks and his pins is a strong U shape. So he's a body condition score five. The bull on the right is a yearling bull. This bull, at sale time, had a back fat of about a quarter of an inch, 2600s. And again, as we look at him, you cannot see his last two ribs. His spine's not available. And this area between his hooks and his pins is very flat. And so he's going to be a body condition score six or greater. So as we move into talking about bulls, we have bulls around to improve our herd, but also to breed our cows, right? And that's how we get that herd improvement. So let's talk about spermatogenesis. That's the fancy term for semen development. In bulls, that takes 61 days or about two months. And so anything that has happened in that period of time will impact semen quality and the ability to pass a breeding soundness exam. I always encourage people to think of semen development as a factory. So anything that has happened along that production in that line over the past two months will result in a lemon in the semen production system. We certainly don't want any lemons when it comes time to breed cows. So what's the effect of body condition score on semen quality in physically normal bulls? Wilder and Barth, they are out of the vet school in Saskatoon at the University of Saskatchewan, looked at body condition scores of bulls at breeding soundness time, exam time, and a time period from January to March, which is the green bars, and April to June, which is the yellow bars. We would ideally like to see bulls in a body condition score of four, five, or six at breeding time and at turnout time. And here's the reason why. You can see that the body condition, when we have those bulls and those body condition scores, the percentage of those bulls of satisfactory semen goes up significantly higher. So we range from anywhere being 60% satisfactory to 78% in a January to March time frame for semen checking to 80%, almost 85% in that April to June time frame. So what happens when we buy yearling bulls or even two-year-old bulls at the local production sale? Typically, those bulls are a little heavier in condition because we are trying to optimize production. We're trying to optimize weight gain and marbling in those bulls. And so you can see here on this screen that this shows a comparison of bulls that were weighed at sale time and then weighed again when they were tested, and they looked at the percentage of bulls that would pass a breeding soundness exam. So in a short period of time after that sale, 74% of those bulls passed a semen test or a breeding soundness exam. At that point in time, those bulls were losing about seven pounds a day. When you get out to about 43 to 85 days after that sale, those bulls are losing still about two and a half to three pounds a day, but only half of them passed a breeding soundness exam. So the take-home message is that when we buy these bulls, young bulls, a yearling bull or a two-year-old bull, and take them home, we want to make sure that we are still maintaining their quality of diet so that we don't lose a lot of weight, body condition, and fat. So this year, we are going to see a lot of bulls, or likely going to see a lot of bulls, with scrotal frostbite. And so what's that impact on semen quality? So in this slide, satisfactory semen quality is in the green bar, questionable semen quality is in the yellow bar, and unsatisfactory semen quality is in the gray bar. I want you to look at the boxes with the red squares around them. So they looked at frostbite, and they graded frostbite by the number of scabs that were a penny or larger or a penny and smaller. Severe frostbite were those bulls that had one or more scabs on their scrotum that were larger than a penny. Slight was one or more that were smaller. So when we look at severe frostbite, and bulls that had breeding soundness exams, for example, conducted it from January to March, zero. None of those bulls had what we would consider to be a satisfactory breeding soundness exam. Somewhere around 30% had what we would consider to be a questionable one. As we move down here to May and June, you can see that the percentage of bulls that have satisfactory breeding soundness exams or semen quality increases significantly. So the take-home message is to protect the scrotum and testicles from the cold. The easiest way, most logical way to do that is with some good windbreak and good bedding. And so on the picture on the left, you can see that these bulls are bedded with some nice straw, and there's some really nice natural windbreak through these trees. This can also be a man-made windbreak, whether that happens to be stacks of bales or some of these portable windbreaks. As you can see in Canada, maybe they protect the scrotum and testicles of bulls a little bit different. They've utilized a crown royal sack. We know that that is maybe not appropriate here and the easiest thing to do. So in summary, bulls should be in a body condition score of 4 to 7 at pre-breeding time and at turnout. We want those bulls to maintain condition through the breeding season, but we don't want them to be too fat. Maintain young recently purchased bulls on a similar plane of nutrition and diet as they were when they were purchased, and then slowly step them down. If you have not done so, check out the body condition scores of your herd sires now. Ask someone who's knowledgeable about cattle to check out the body condition score of your herd, both your bulls and cows, too. Don't confuse hair, muscle, and or hay belly with condition. And get help developing a ration if you need to add some condition. This is really important in bulls because we don't want to get them too fat, and we don't want to step them up on too hot of a diet. Most of our county extension offices have software and ration development ability if you need some help. Next, we talked about this. Bedding bulls and, in fact, bedding cattle is really important. Provide some windbreak. Breeding soundness exams are really important. We need to have our bulls tested within a month of breeding season. That gives us enough time to find bulls if our bulls happen to not test well, but it also is an appropriate amount of time for them to have that breeding soundness exam be accurate when you turn them out. Don't save pennies to waste dollars by skipping a breeding soundness exam. Most veterinarians charge $50 to $100 for a breeding soundness exam, and while that seems like a lot of money, think about this. If your cows breed just 21 days later because your bull failed the breeding soundness exam, that ends up being somewhere around 50 pounds of waning weight. If calves sell for $1.50 a pound, that is $75 per head that you have lost. You could have paid for that breeding soundness exam with just one calf. Remember that that semen test is only good for the day it was taken, and that semen development takes 60 days. And so with that, thank you. I wish you the best of luck as we move into spring. And next, Dr. Jerry Stuck is going to talk about managing calves that have been chilled and cold stress in calves. Thank you, Lisa. Good to be with you this evening. I know that this is really not a topic that it's all enjoyable to talk about. We're going to talk about it anyway. We've still got winter left and a storm coming, and I hope none of you have to deal with cold stress calves, but we're going to focus in for the next few minutes on talking about how we handle and how we deal with it and how we recognize it. Well, these are the three things we're going to discuss. We're going to talk about how to recognize a calf that may be in trouble, and I'm sure that's nothing new for those of you in the audience. You know how to tell when calves aren't doing well or doing right. We're going to talk about some intervention and then maybe some things about what the outcomes might be. You know, I noticed some things that all of us are going to talk about, and bedding and wind protection come into play here, and yet the snow amounts they're talking about, it does cause us some issues. It's supposed to be wet snow, and whenever we have those kind of conditions, the problem with moisture is that it decreases the level of insulation on an animal. It's not just the cows, but it's those calves, and those calves with... Not a whole lot of body weight and a lot of surface area. They tend to suffer the most when it gets to be these tough conditions. So you need to be doing what you can. Be out there as often as you can during this tough weather. I know you're going to probably lose some sleep over the next few days, but being out there probably saves you some calves, and so think about what your schedule is, and if you can get somebody to check calves for you during the nighttime, or even the daytimes you can get some sleep, sure helps. Barns do help in situations like that, and just a reminder to keep them as clean as possible and fresh bedding at this time of the year. I just want to talk a little bit about behavior of animals that are under some stress and cold stress, and remember that cold stress can happen in a lot of different outside temperatures. I mean, the critical temperature for calves is probably somewhere around 55 degrees, so all that means that is when the temperature goes below that, they have to take in more energy to maintain that body heat, and we'd like 55 degrees now, but calves can handle it if they're able to get up and nurse and the mother takes care of them, but the behavior that you need to be aware of that they'll exhibit when they're in cold stress is maybe standing off by themselves and hunched up, and of course you'll see that when they can't get out of the wind, but they also can be just laying down even next to the mother, and you won't notice it, and you need to determine whether that calf has nursed or not, and sometimes I'll admit it's hard to determine that, but look at the udder. Do the teats look dry, and when it's moisture outside, they probably won't look dry. They'll look wet, but is their hair on the udder dry? Are the udder quarters full? A lot of things to look for, but if you're still wondering, you need to put your fingers, and clean fingers preferably, in the mouth and see if that mouth is cold. If that mouth is cold, they have not nursed, and you're going to have to intervene, and even beyond that, when you get a calf that's cold and vocalizing, that is a really bad clinical sign, and I sometimes use the term 5% chance of survival, so the prognosis in a calf that's vocalizing is really, really poor. We define hypothermia on calves as anything below 98 degree Fahrenheit rectal temperature. You know, newborn calves should be somewhere in that 99, 100, 102. We can actually have severe hypothermia down to 86 degrees. Those calves will definitely need to be intervened. I don't, I don't, I'm not telling you you need to run around with a rectal thermometer. I'm telling you that you can probably identify those calves that need help just by their behavior. If you have one, that's fine, but it's not something you need to have to identify a calf that needs help. This is just a reminder that better days are ahead. We will get through this March, and we will have green grass, and some of you will have calves on green grass, so just remember this doesn't, these next two days don't last forever. Just want to make a couple of comments about this. In order for a calf to maintain its, maintain its core temperature and maintain its life when it's cold out, he has to increase metabolic activity, and of course that happens when that calf leaves the uterine environment that's nice and warm and safe, and now all of a sudden he's shoved out into the cold environment, and so his metabolic activity has to really jump ahead and get on board. There's some mentioned that the metabolic activity will increase 5x over the resting phase, and what calves end up doing is they end up shivering, and that helps them to generate heat, and I've got a comment in here below shivering. It talks about calving difficulty. When a calf is having trouble being born or the mother's having trouble delivering that calf, that actually is a detriment to that calf's ability to withstand cold temperatures because it messes with the metabolic activity. Even a calf that's born unassisted is going to have increased cortisol, and just a little bit of cortisol allows that calf to better utilize fat. We're going to talk about brown fat in just a little bit, but also the sugar stores, the glycogen and protein to create heat, and what happens in cold temperatures in addition to increased metabolic activity when it's cold out, there's vasoconstriction. In other words, the vessels will constrict, and you don't have that blood flow to the ears and feet and tail, and that's why when it gets really cold and you see problems result, that's the pieces of the anatomy that get affected the most. Just a little comment on calving ease just to back up what I just mentioned about calving ease and calves' ability to withstand cold and get up and nurse. I want to mention something about brown fat, and we don't often think about that. You think in terms of white fat. Well, calves are born with brown fat, and they have the unique ability, and it's gone after just a short period of time, but they have a unique ability to use that fat to keep warm, and calves that are born to cows' inadequate body condition score, back to what Lisa was talking about, those calves will have a little better supply of brown fat that gets them through the tough times and gets them to get up and start nursing. So it's a big deal having cows and inadequate body condition score, especially in cold temperatures, is really important. Just a couple comments about colostrum. We'll come back to this again in just a bit. If you think about a calf in thermoneutral zone, thermoneutral zone, and I mentioned this earlier, but thermoneutral zone for calves probably somewhere in that 50 to 55 degree Fahrenheit range, they need, in order to maintain their heat source, they need almost two-thirds of a gallon of colostrum. Now, colostrum will differ from cow to cow and from breed to breed and dairy breeds and beef breeds, but just kind of an idea of what those calves actually need. And when that temperature falls below that thermoneutral zone, then they actually need a little bit more just to maintain their energy that they need for internal body heat. And remember that our beef cattle do an amazing job of acclimating to the cold. So when I talk about thermoneutral zone, I mean, our cattle grow longer hair. They do lots of things to acclimate to the cold. If they didn't, we wouldn't be able to raise cattle outdoors. I mean, even in temperatures way below zero, if the sun is shining and there's no wind and they're laying in bedding, those calves actually do extremely well. Frostbite. It's one of the side effects of this cold stress that you can have. It can have frostbite right on the skin, but a lot of times what we see happen first is that the tips of the ears will freeze and then they'll necrosse and then they'll fall off. And that's okay. Those calves will be okay if it's just the tips of the ears. The one that becomes really dangerous is when their feet freeze. And you'll notice, you can notice this early on perhaps when you feel the feet and they're just frozen solid. And if you don't notice it, then those calves will actually get up and move around and be fine. But after a day or so, maybe by 48 hours, those feet become swollen. They actually get a little, what I call squishy because there's edema fluid in the tissues and they're painful. And you can wait a while to see if somehow there's a miracle that occurs and they improve, but most of the time they're not going to be treatable at that stage and those calves will likely have to be put down. So how do we heat those calves up? Lots of different ways, lots of different methods, you know, heaters, floor heats and blankets and hot boxes. And I just want you to think about this though because when a calf is really hypothermic, you know, I mentioned that 86 degree rectal temperatures is extreme hypothermia. It's going to be hard to conduct enough heat through the hide to raise that internal body temperature. So, and in order to do that, really the calf has to also have the ability to produce heat. And that's why in both of these instances, those calves need colostrum. I know you're in a hurry to get that calf warmed up, but sometime during that period when you're warming, you got to provide colostrum because that allows calf, that calf to get some energy that it really needs. Warm water is, tends to be very efficient at warming calves. And some of you may have bathtubs available. Sometimes you need to carry them right in the house and put them in the bathtub, 100 degree Fahrenheit water. And I'd be, I'll just caution you a little bit. Sometimes it's okay to warm those calves up a little bit with dry heat first so that it's not so much of a shock. So rubbing and putting external heat on is okay. So you can start to raise some of that temperature, but the bathtub still may be needed in those calves that are extremely hypothermic. And also they need colostrum. Yes, this is my famous picture of a calf in the bathtub. And that one actually did survive, believe it or not. Just a couple comments again on colostrum itself. Fresh is the best. Some is better than none. And sometimes you need to put that beef cow that doesn't know that you're trying to help her in the calf. Got to put them in a head catch. And this is where you need some help. You need somebody to grab the tail near the base and move it to a vertical position so she won't kick so much and put your head in that flank and milk the nearest heat. And then once they kind of calm down, you can kind of release some pressure. But that fresh colostrum is the best. Energy source, immune source that those calves need. Frozen colostrum is fine. I'd prefer if you harvest it from your own herd. I'm a little leery of taking frozen colostrum from other herds and from dairy herds. There are colostrum substitutes on the market today. And look at the label, make sure they got a minimum of 100 grams of immunoglobulins that those calves need. I know I always get questions about brandy and whiskey and five-hour energy drinks. Brandy and whiskey, I'm pretty sure, are designed for human consumption. I'm not sure about five hours. I don't know of any studies done on them. So stick with the things you know. Colostrum is the best. I'm going to pass this over at this time to Jana Block, our extension livestock specialist out in Headinger. Jana, you take it away. All right. Thanks, Jerry. Okay. So I'm going to be visiting with you a little bit about how to evaluate your nutrition program. And I know it's been a long haul for many of us and still looking like we're facing a little bit of winter. So it's important to be really critical and evaluate what's going on with your nutrition programs as we try to finish out the rest of this winter and head into spring. So things that we need to consider are obviously quality and quantity of our base diet. Most of the time that's going to consist of forage. So don't be like the guy in this cartoon here and let the whitetails show you which are the best bales. Get your hay inventory conducted and I'll talk about an example of that shortly. And also make sure you get nutrient analysis conducted so that you know exactly what you're dealing with. Obviously, you have to know what different types of production groups that you have to take care of. If you've got some first calf heifers, some old thin cows, mature cows, your bulls, those are all going to have different requirements and you're going to need to feed them strategically based on your feed resources. Most of you are calving now or you have been for some time and so that's going to impact requirements in terms of when your cows get to peak lactation which is approximately 60 days after calving. That's also going to really kind of match up with our pasture turnout dates in terms of when we have to feed that high quality forage when requirements are at their highest. What's the condition of our cow herd? Evaluate body condition score and I'll talk about a couple of other strategies to kind of monitor nutrient status. And then of course, your considerations are going to always come back to the bottom line. What kind of costs are you looking at? What facilities and labor do you have available? And you might need to consider some alternatives rather than just a full feed hay diet. Okay, so this chart gives you just some rule of thumb for estimating hay intake based on energy content or TDN, total digestible nutrients. So as you can see here, the low quality forages will have the least amount of intake. That's just due to bulk or physical fill due to fiber content. And so our dry cows are going to be able to eat around 1.8% of their body weight of that low quality forage. Lactating cows will increase intake of that. And again, intake will just continue to increase as forage quality increases. And I have just an example of down here on the bottom of comparing intake of a low quality forage at 30.8 pounds to a high quality forage at 37.8 pounds. So again, that's where understanding the quality of your forage is helpful. And this can be used when you're looking at your hay inventory and trying to figure out what the intake should be on various forages based on quality. So Jerry kind of mentioned the lower critical temperature. So in beef cattle, that's just the temperature below which they have to utilize energy to maintain body heat. And so in mature cattle, we're talking about 32 degrees with a dry winter coat or 18 degrees with a heavy dry winter coat. And so as the temperature starts to decline, you can see that feed intake will increase, energy for production is lost, and the maintenance requirement increases. So we can utilize the ambient temperature and wind speed to calculate an effective temperature. And we use this effective temperature to determine how much additional energy those cattle are going to require just to maintain body heat. So again, a basic rule of thumb is to increase TDN or energy by 1% for every degree below the lower critical temperature. So if we have the dry heavy winter coat that I talked about in the previous slide, our lower critical temperature is 18 degrees. So if we have air temperature of zero and a wind speed of 20, we're looking at an effective temperature of minus 39. So we take our lower critical temperature minus our minus 39 and those cows are going to require 57% more energy. So just going through some nutrition calculations here and I know I'm throwing a lot of numbers at you. I can definitely get you copies of this slide or you can print it from the webinar later. Just showing you the relative difference in how much energy is going to be required by that cow just based on that wind speed and temperature. And so if we were able to feed that cow the amount of forage that she's going to need to meet her energy requirements, she'd be eating 3.6% of body weight. That might be possible in some feedlot diets. That's still on the high side and probably not possible with our forage-based diets. So we have to find some other ways to reduce maintenance requirements and the amount of feed that those cows are going to require. So just a couple ways that you can do that. Many of you are probably already doing some of these things. Need to think about providing some higher quality forages or grain or byproduct feeds, just more energy dense feeds. Again, forage will generate the most amount of heat per unit, but we can't get enough forage into them based on that really high energy requirement. And it's also difficult for cattle to utilize poor quality feeds when it's cold because intake increases, passage rate increases, and nutrient utilization will actually decrease. And so just providing the higher quality feeds is a good idea at that time. Separating off thin and young cows separate and feeding them separately is a good idea if you have the facilities just to give them a little more attention and again, be strategic about the cattle that you need to maybe provide a little more nutrient dense feeds. Also, Lisa mentioned it, Jerry mentioned it, windbreaks and shelter are really critical. That's going to really help reduce the effect of the wind chill and reduce that effective temperature. If natural shelter isn't available, need to get out there and provide some portable wind brakes, tires, hay bales, whatever you've got. A lot of you already probably feed in late afternoon or early evening if you can stand it. I know a lot of times it's hard for producers to kind of wait to feed, but basically what that does is just kind of generates more heat of fermentation later in the middle of the night when those cattle need it the most and typically the temperature is up the lowest. I wanted to just mention hay waste. Most producers are utilizing round bales and that's good for minimizing labor, but we do know that studies have shown that waste can be pretty high when you're rolling out bales, 20 to 45%. So you are in the situation where you're having to unroll bales out on feed ground. It's a good idea to try to limit access. A one versus a four day supply, they've shown that hay waste is reduced by 20%. So obviously if we're coming into a blizzard situation and you feel like you need to put a few days of feed out, go ahead and do that. This is just thinking long term over the entire feeding period, providing it one day at a time is probably your best bet. Feeding on fresh ground if possible is going to be important to increase utilization and intake. And then obviously feeding low quality hay first and trying to encourage them to consume all that before they go to the high quality feeds. It's really difficult to put out high quality feed and then kind of force them to go back and consume that low quality forage. So we're thinking about reducing waste. A couple things come to mind. Obviously using a bale processor. So basically that just functions to reduce particle size, increase passage rate, and then increase intake. So it's a good way to increase utilization of low to medium quality forages. Disadvantages, possibly some increased costs due to labor, fuel, investment, and equipment. You can also get some leaf loss, particularly on windy days, which we have a lot here in North Dakota. So that's just some consideration. You can look at your increased feed availability and utilization versus the amount of cost that it's going to take to get you there. Hay feeders are certainly another option. They've been shown to really reduce feeding losses. It doesn't work in every situation, obviously, but the cone feeder with a waste panel at the bottom is definitely a consistent feeder that results in the least amount of hay waste. So this just goes back to calculating, you know, conducting a hay inventory and calculating how much you're going to need to get you through the rest of the winter. Again, just a couple of examples here. So we need to know body weight of our cows. We need to know the percent of body weight as forage that they're consuming and that's based on forage quality, which you get from your forage analysis. And then we're going to need to calculate in a waste factor here to get pounds of forage consumed per cow per day. Just an example, 1,400 pounds, eating 2.5% of body weight. I put in a waste factor of 25% and so they're going to be eating right, needing right around 44 pounds per cow per day. If we have a 60-day feeding period to get through, hopefully we're going to have green forage available after that. And so that's the total amount of forage needed per cow. You also need to know your bale weights and your dry matter. Again, that's your nutrient analysis. And so based on our bale weight and the 90% dry matter, that's how much dry matter we have available per bale. So we end up right around 2.2 bales per cow. And you could do a quick estimation of this just based on one bale per cow per month, adding in a little bit of extra, like I said, for waste. And this doesn't necessarily mean that this is exactly how much each cow needs. You're going to have to adjust based on temperature, condition, forage quality, and all those other factors that we've kind of talked about. When you do look at supplementing some low quality forages, it's important to know what your goal is and how to most effectively meet that goal. And so if we're talking about low quality forages that have less than 7% protein, that's the point at which ruminal fermentation could be limited. And so we need to look at providing a high quality protein supplement containing greater than 20%. So we've got alfalfa hay, soybean meal, distillers, grains. The nice thing about cows is they can be fed these every two to three days because of their ability to recycle nitrogen. If you've got a forage with greater than 7% protein, you might need to look at supplying an energy supplement. And again, that's going to be based on the different requirements of your various production groups. And you need to kind of look at whether you choose a fiber versus a starch based supplement. So some of our fiber supplements are soy holes, wheat mits, and distillers grains. And our starches are our feed grains, corn, barley, and other things like that. So we know if we feed too much starch on a forage-based diet, it's going to reduce digestibility and intake of a forage. And that's just based on changes to microbial population. So there's some things you can do to be strategic and make sure that you're meeting those needs effectively without too much impact on the microbes. just want to quickly show you a feed cost calculator. This was developed jointly by the North Dakota Farm Management Education Program and NDSU Extension. This is just a simple Excel spreadsheet and you can go in and customize all of your feedstuffs and you can put in weight. We thought it was really important to include your trucking costs, how many miles that you have to incorporate when you're evaluating that. so you get a total trucking cost. You can go down here to nutrient content and use your values from your feed analysis and plug those in. It'll calculate your dry matter per ton, your energy and protein per ton and what you end up with is dollar amount per pound of nutrient and so that's what we want you to use to compare supplements when you're trying to make those supplementation decisions. And just a couple additional considerations before I turn it over to John. Really important to not forget about water. We know that cold use is going to increase metabolic water use and so this time of year we don't think about cattle's water requirements as much as we do in the heat of summer but they still require adequate water for making sure that we get good feed digestion and utilization and maintain performance and health especially with lactating cows. So probably minimum a gallon per 100 pounds of body weight. I know people have had a huge amount of challenges this year just dealing with ice in the tanks so a couple different options here for tanks that maybe aren't next to an electric source. Propane stock tank heater, there's water circulators. Some of those may result in some excess water flow and so that can be a challenge but check into different products that are available out there. And then another thing is you just need to once we get your forage analysis done, your hay inventory done, you want to take a look at how that's performing in your cow herd. Again, evaluate that body condition score and take a look at manure consistency. This pile here where there's not really a lot of solid rings shows that that cow's getting a little bit of excess protein. Here we have adequate protein but you see some rings and there's usually a crater type appearance at the top of the pile. And then down here we get into deficient protein. There's definitely very obvious rings and usually this manure pile would be very firm. And so that's just one other option for evaluating the nutrient status of your herd. Again, I've known, I've thrown a lot at you tonight. Be sure and contact me if you have questions or put them in the chat box. And I'm going to go ahead and turn things over to John Dubetter and he's going to talk to you about stretching limited hay. Thank you, Jana. Welcome to anybody who might have joined us on the webinar. Up here in Minot, we've had a couple days of reprieve from the weeks and weeks of bitter cold wind chills which stressed a lot of things. Equipment, people, livestock and calves. And unfortunately, I think we're all aware that there's some more stuff coming to North Dakota and some new challenges with some blizzard conditions. It's truly amazing to me just how hardy our cattle are as these pictures kind of illustrate. They can cope with a lot when we do our part to get them out of the wind, have a little backbat on them and keep their rumen full so they generate some heat of fermentation and have some energy to deal with the wind chills and the cold. In the cases when we can't do that for one reason or another, we got some cattle suffering from some lameness or age, it's pretty conceivable to have cows lose three or four pounds a day and a condition score within less than a month of time. We've talked about how their energy needs go up with the cold and the wind chill. And along with that, their appetites go up, their rate of passage goes up, they can eat more feed and we as stockmen give them more feed because it's absolutely necessary. What that does though is it puts us in a position now that some things have happened. What we thought was an adequate feed supply all of a sudden is starting to look a little short and we've got some instances of people running a little low and concerned that their hay might not get them to where they need to go. How that happens is just looking at what we've had to do. If we've been feeding 35 pounds of hay normally under more normal weather and we've had weeks upon weeks of extreme weather with minus 40 and 30 wind chills daily and we fed 50 pounds, we've all of a sudden fed 40% more hay over those two months. That's led us to a situation where we might have to adapt some management to stretch the hay that we still have. We're not anywhere close to grass. For most of us, turnout might be in mid-May even late May so we need to have a plan on how we're going to get there. One of the things that we can do is we could probably go out and try to find some additional hay. The reality of being able to find it at the cost we might be able to locate it for is probably time to look at some other alternatives. Most cases, feeding some grain or concentrate feed and limiting the hay somewhat might be an option that we really have to consider. I've got two rations in this slide. One for the last month of gestation and one for the first month of lactation as calving is undergoing right now. We know what a cow needs for her energy needs and we know we can supply that with medium to better quality hay if we fed 40 pounds in late gestation or fed 45 pounds in early lactation. If we don't have that much hay we could restrict the hay to probably 30 pounds feed five or six pounds of corn and with the bedding and a little extra straw out there to help her get content and fill up her rumen we could still meet her TDN or energy needs. If we happen to have a limited supply of hay but we're long on silage we can adjust the ration as well to feed a lower percent hay maybe a third hay two thirds or more silage and we can meet her needs that way. Now I recognize some people are a little careful about how much silage a high energy feed they can feed at calving time. A little concerned about high milk production to a young calf who can't handle it and the potential to cause some digestive or scouring calves but we can manage that by limiting that to an appropriate level. feeding grains a little different than feeding hay so we got to take things a little slower and understand that we got a potential to cause some digestive problems if we don't do it right. For the most part it's a new feed to cow it's a fast digesting feed and it should be introduced into the ration fairly slowly we don't want any cows to overeat too fast create an acidotic rumen and it might have some consequences of bloat confounder and so forth. Typically we also want to try to feed these starchier grains at a low percent of the ration just so we don't interfere with the digestion of the fiber that might be in the ration and we still get the value out of our forages. Generally that's feeding less than four tenths of percent of body weight or in the cows in this state that might be four to six pounds. For wheat and barley we know cracking them breaking the seed counts can have created or enhanced the digestibility of those feeds and we also like Janice said some of our rations may be short of protein and maybe a grain byproduct which is typically higher in protein may be more appropriate than feeding just a straight grain. As well as when we feed these byproducts or a higher grain ration they're high in phosphorus low in calcium you might want to consider that or check our mineral to make sure we're not overfeeding phosphorus and underfeeding calcium and pick a mineral with the right blend or proportions of those two. But most importantly if we're going to feed a limited amount of grain to a herd of cows we have to have a way of getting it out there getting it distributed so we don't have some cows eating excessive amounts and some cows not getting enough so we got to give each cow her fair share and distribute the grain over a pretty wide area for that to happen. One of the biggest challenges is how you do that how you get four or five pounds of grain to your cows in a timely manner and everybody gets a share and it's hard to handle grain if all you've got is a loader tractor for most people or for people who are feeding a mixed ration with the feed wagon certainly just weighing in the grain adding it to the mix of forages and feeding it out works very well. Some people are not equipped with silage or don't feed silage and so we've got some other options with that and we could probably get a cake feeder or cake box go out there and put it all on the ground or we can add an attachment to a you know a bale processor some of them have hoppers you can put 20-30 bushels of corn or grain in and top dress the shred hay. feeding grain has also got some challenges and sometimes it's pretty difficult with a large herd of cattle to feed them in such a way that we can actually minimize the waste you know if we've got hard frozen ground dry sod or compacted snow and ice you know cows do a pretty good job of licking up grain off of those surfaces however if we get some slush and mud and deep snow it won't work very well in those cases we almost have to go to feeding these things in some kind of a bunk system or if we're feeding it on the sod or the ground certainly it's even better to feed small piles such as with a trip hopper on your feeding attachment so we put little piles over a row rather than a continuous very small shallow line of grain certainly grain feeding is a way to stretch our forage a little bit it's also something that we might be kind of required to as hay pile diminishes and we just have to stretch everything so we're going to do what it takes and I commend you for being the stockman yard and you know taking care of these cattle under these difficult conditions and now I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Carl Hoppe and he's going to talk to us a little about where maybe we can source some of these additional feeds thank you John I know in our part of the world here winter's really been extended cold and our hay reserves have been used up pretty quickly this year and we're now looking for other options to supplement our cowherds so alternative feeds are certainly one of those things that can be used co-product feeds are moderate to high in protein they're moderate to high in energy content as well a couple of things that poor quality forages straws definitely need to have added to it so co-products work well as a supplement or partial replacement for a forage based ration works excitingly well for low quality forages like straws or slew haze or if we've already used our good quality feeds and we need to add something to the poor quality feeds co-products certainly are something that work out quite well surprisingly north dakota has many co-products mills crushes refineries and processing plants across the state when you get the other states they don't have the number of opportunities that we have in north dakota now i recognize that most of these crushes and mills and processing plants are located on the eastern part of the state which means that we have ready access on our side on the western side of the state they have the same access but they have freight costs that need to be added to it just how much co-products do we produce in north dakota there's two examples that i'll share of just how much volume we produce our state mill and elevator that's owned by the state of north dakota it's the largest single durham wheat mill located in the world at one location there's other companies that are bigger but we actually have the largest in one location it mills 90,000 bushels of wheat a day or durum into flour or semolina that means it produces a co-product they mill out the starch the co-product the fiber and the proteins are left over and that's called wheat meds or wheat middlings and they produce 100 ton a day which is around 33 semi-loads just to give a feeling at 10 pounds per head per day they produce enough feed to feed 20,000 head of cattle daily north dakota has 900,000 head of cattle or almost a million head of cattle so you can see that 20% of our of our cowherds in north dakota could be fed just what we produce out of this one particular meal and it's a high quality feed of 18% crude protein and 83% even more production in co-product feed is found in our ethanol distilleries across north dakota we have five plants in north dakota they produce 3,000 3,500 to 4,000 tons daily of distiller's grains that's on a dry matter basis given the cow inventory that we have we can feed seven pounds of distiller's grains utilize this feed to every cow every day or if we just looked at a seven month period we could feed 12 pounds of distiller's grains per day there's that much product produced in north dakota 12 pounds of distiller's grains would really take the edge off of how much hay is needed for a cow ration not only that if you look at 30% crude protein you're giving almost three and a half pounds of crude protein per cow per day which just is a heck of a lot of protein to provide to a cow but on a poor quality ration that might be something a cow certainly needs this time of the year again it's 38% crude protein and 86% TDM again high quality feeds cow products there's two big issues that occur with them and that's going to be the pricing of it as well as the freight freight costs can get to be pretty high it's very competitive with other local feeds when you look at the price of these co-products which have to include the price of the freight western north dakota certainly will have a higher cost than our eastern part of north dakota it has to compete with our other feeds like grains, hayes and other available co-products but there are some limitations on our co-products there are some long-term storability issues with some wheat meds tend to take moisture out of the air and consequently mold unless they've been put on an air floor during the summertime distiller's grains used to have bridging problems with it it can still have things like distiller's excuse me wheat meds is very light and fluffy unless it's pelleted which increases density twofold and makes it a lot easier to transport some feeds like the wet corn gluten feed or the wet distiller's grains or beet tailings or beet pulp all are high in moisture and of course mold can become an issue too calculating cost per pound of nutrient can easily be done it's just a matter of taking the feed that you're going to be using and taking the cost per ton and dividing it by the energy content of the feed so in this example I used $90 ton wheat meds that has an 86 TDN you do the math and all of a sudden your cost per pound protein pound of TDN or energy content is $0.05 a pound if you need these TDN values go to our NDSU AS1182 alternative byproduct feeds publication and it has a directory of prices of TDN values in the end not price of TDN values we have a bunch of co-products across North Dakota in most part they're all low in starch and high in fiber and high in protein feeds that are perfect for a cowherd that's being fed a low quality forage in the milling process or fermentation process most of the starch is removed in these products and or the oil if it's an oil seed resolved it's going to be something that's very high in fiber and usually high in protein too and this fiber I need to point out is very digestible and ruminant diet distillers grains are produced in five different plants in North Dakota Therets and Esalen at Castleton Hankinson Renewable Energy at Hankinson Dakota Spirit Ag Ethanol at Spiritwood Blue Fund Ethanol at Underwood as well as Red Trail Energy at Richardson it's a very popular feed you can see some of the values over here it's very palatable that's an understatement cows really go after this feed quite well it mixes well with other feeds condescens the feed maybe there's a limit to 30% of the diet because of some of the sulfur issues that you want to use there are ethanol plants in other parts in South Dakota and other states that can be trucked into North Dakota too right now they've raised the price of distillers grains so it's still cost competitive but at $160 a ton it's no longer one of the cheapest feeds out there that we can provide to our cow herd wheat middlings is another option there's five plants in North Dakota that produces wheat mids Dakota growers in Carrington Minot Milling in Minot Arnott Milling down at Fairmont of course North Dakota Mill and Elevator that we talked about at Grand Forks and to a lesser extent the plant up in Candu some of these have already been their source of supply has been booked out for the year although at the mill and elevator in Dakota growers availability is still available and at $80 or $90 a ton turns into a fairly competitive feed corn gluten feed is created through the process of a wet corn milling which is the plant located down at Wapton North Dakota at Cargill of course wet corn milling makes high fructose corn syrup and the leftover product is 83% TDN 20% protein very palatable it can be sold as either dried or wet you need to contact these people because usually availability is rather reduced because they're sold out it's that popular of a feed it's very palatable soy hulls is a product that we haven't had in North Dakota unless we freighted it in from Minnesota or South Dakota until the recent several years now the ADM plant in Inderland is producing soy hulls since they're now crushing North Dakota soybeans it's a high energy content feed it's pelleted its protein can range from 8 to 13% so be sure to know what your product is if you may not be considered a protein source for your feed but it certainly is a replacement for our feed I do have to point out that it's usually high in calcium and low in phosphorus most of our other co-products are always high in phosphorus maybe triple times the amount of phosphorus it would be in grain and of course calcium is quite low and like John identified adding extra calcium to co-product feeds is always indicated if you're located close enough to a beet pulp plant or a sugar refinery like American Crystal in Hillsboro Drayton East Grand Forks or Crookston or even MnDAC down at Wahpeton they have a supply of beet pulp and tailings that they usually at least American Crystal provides at no cost other than trucking of course you need to be on the list to be able to get it and if you have a trucker that hauls that this is a product that works quite well think of it as a nice replacement for silage if you're feeding the wet pulp or the wet beet tailings be sure to note the moisture content is quite high so that's what limits trucking to usually around 100 miles away from the plant before other sources of feed get to be priced more competitive we do have protein sources or crushes in North Dakota canola mill is very popular if that's all you need it's usually price competitive it's produced in Velva as well as Endolin or West Fargo even up in Holic, Minnesota these plants are available linseed mill is crushed in Cargill and West Fargo on a sporadic basis but it is available soybean mill is priced very high and it works quite well if you want to use soybean in your ration that's produced on ADM and Endolin 46% crude protein the real bargain on these particular protein sources right now is sunflower mill so if you're needing protein sunflower mill could be $120 a ton even less than that and it's available out of Cargill and West Fargo and it can be available out of Northern Sun and Endolin if you need to have a list of co-products both the phone numbers as well as a recent price please go to our Carrington Research Extension Center homepage on the internet and look for livestock and then look for livestock extension and then click on sources and prices for selected co-products in North Dakota and with that good luck in trying to source extra feed for your cow herd if you're running yourself short on hay and can't find hay there is a vast amount of co-products available in North Dakota if you can find out what's available our next speaker is going to be Miranda Meehan she's our livestock environmental sewer specialist and Dr. Meehan is here to talk to us about pasture and range turnout issues good evening so I'm going to change paces a little bit here and talk about what we expect as we look forward to greener grass and some strategies to help you plan for the 2019 grazing season one thing I want to keep you all to keep in mind is that yes we do have a lot of snow and there's a lot of moisture in that snow but due to the timing of melt and how things melt a lot of that snow is going to be runoff and yes it's going to be great for refilling some of our stock dams and surface waters however that is not going to be available there's not going to be the principal source of responsible for our forage production this year 80% of forage production in North Dakota comes from precipitation in May and June so don't be making your grazing management decisions based off of the available precipitation snow that we have right now so when we when I talk we talk about preparing for our grazing season and when should we be putting those cattle out there I know a lot of people use a calendar date the ideal way to do this is to look at grazing readiness based off of plant development or you can estimate it using growing degree days we do have a publication that goes through that so I'm not going to go into detail the simplest way is to go out there look at plant development or introduce pasture species such as crested wheatgrass smoothbrome grass meadowbrome that would be the three leaf stage and so you just simply are going to count the leaves starting from the bottom one two three and then for our native species it would be the three and a half leaf stage and why do we use this as a rule of thumb it's important to be looking at this and not grazing our plants too early because grazing too early can stress those plants out and actually result in up to a 60% decrease in your forage production for the grazing season as a typical rule of thumb we expect that our crested wheatgrass is already early May our bromes smoothbrome grass meadowbrome grass being the most common typically ready to graze in mid-May if you have post-contract CRP land that's typically stuff that's coming out of contract is typically some recall intermediate wheatgrasses and you can expect that to be available in late May and our native pastures typically aren't ready until earliest is early June depending if your cool or warm season dominated and that would be our cool season dominated pastures which are most common across the state however I want to keep in mind remind you is that there's a lot of variability so we don't want to be careful when just looking at those states it varies across the state some research that we've been doing with extension agents across the state shows two weak variability between counties when different species are available to graze and also we have year-to-year variability so just because that's the date you were able to start grazing last year does not mean that that's when our species are going to be available to graze this year so the last two years I have been working with some of the county agents across the state to monitor grazing readiness for some of our common pasture species crested wheatgrass smooth bromegrass and then our most common native species which would be western wheatgrass we also have some with that green needlegrass but there's some challenges there because it's a little bit more difficult to identify early in the grazing season in 2017 we found that crested wheatgrass was ready to graze at that three-leaf stage around May 4th where our brome was actually earlier at late April April 24th where our western wheatgrass wasn't available wasn't at the three-and-a-half leaf stage until the end of May almost Memorial Day one of the reasons you're probably wondering why is crested wheatgrass behind smooth bromegrass when I said that should be available to graze earlier I don't know if you remember that we warmed up pretty early in 2017 but then we had a cold snap later as things were starting to grow and that set some of our grasses back including the crested wheatgrass which was further in development at that time I did get a lot of pictures from county agents where they were out there monitoring grazing readiness and they had pictures of the grass with snow looking at 2018 our crested wheatgrass was similar we were at May 11 and then our smooth brome grass was actually two weeks later at May 7 so typically around where we would normally expect it to be our west rain grass was about the same at that end of May May 20th it was this year so one of the things that we've seen here that we actually seen a delay in some of the species because of the drought of 2017 and depending on if those areas if pastures were grazed hard they've seen a decrease in productivity and a delay in grazing readiness in some areas so I expect something similar this year with we will have a delay in our grazing readiness because there's a delay with all the snow when our plants are going to start growing and photosynthesizing and our ground is going to take longer to warm up how long that delay is going to be I can't say right now we do plan on working with the agents across the state and monitoring again this year so hopefully we can keep you up to date on that as we move forward I know a lot of you are probably itching to get out and get your cows out of lots and especially with the snow when it starts to melt you're going to have a mess and really want to get them out of there you're also running short on hay supplies so here there's some strategies that we can look at to get them out there a little earlier but while reducing the stress to those pastures and I'm talking about these in what I would say the order of preference so ideally if you can looking at supplementing on hay or pasture land pasture again native or it would be those tain grass species not native specifically things like the bromes and your crested and then providing them some additional forage if you still have it available or supplementing with some of the other products that Carl talked about the next one thing to look at would be grazing some of those domesticated grass pastures then moving in if you don't have that as an option utilizing some of your winter annuals for spring grazing those should be available early May so things like triticale rye or winter wheat if you planted those last fall then the next thing if those aren't options for you would be evaluating what you have for native pastures native rangelands we have a pretty big issue across the state with Kentucky bluegrass invading our native rangelands and becoming dominant on a lot of pastures especially eastern portion of the state so if look at this picture here this would be a pasture that's been taken over by Kentucky bluegrass so that would be a good option if you're going to graze native range if you have a pasture like that starting there actually could help decrease your Kentucky bluegrass grazing it early in the season and give some of your natives a competitive advantage one thing is that this would be very low in protein so you definitely would need to supplement protein in this situation and then finally if you have to graze native pastures choosing one that's dominated by cool season grasses and if you're not sure about composition need some help with identification contact your extension agent or your NRCS I'm sure they'd be happy to come out and help you with that a few other considerations which we haven't talked about yet is this is especially with this coming storm we're talking record level historic storms that you need to be thinking about flooding if we have a riparian pasture that we usually turn out in the spring maybe avoiding that because it's going to be a mess for one and you're going to have a decline in health but also that that is going to tear that pasture up and may reduce its productivity in the long run other thing is you know a lot of you aren't thinking about drought right now except for maybe those of you that were impacted in 2018 but we did see that delay in grazing readiness from those areas impacted by the 2017 drought if they were grazed hard we also see decrease in productivity this is a good example of that delay in Oliver County last year western wheatgrass in mid-May was at the one and a half leaf stage compared to the three and a half leaf stage early May the year before and there's a pretty significant it's probably hard to see in these photos but there's a pretty significant difference in the productivity and the height of the forge in those two pictures and we actually seen that as it stayed pretty stunted as it got to the three and a half leaf stage there was an isolated part of the state that did experience drought in 2018 so if you were in that area you also some of you also had the experience drought in 17 so being cautious and maybe not starting on pastures that you put extra pressure on in those years so they have a little extra time to recover as always try not you know not overgrazing if you do put a little extra pressure on a pasture make sure that you're allowing enough time for it to recover from that extra pressure so if you started in a pet you're starting in one of your native pastures early in the grazing season this year making sure that you don't come back into that pasture again until next fall and if you need any help with some thoughts or ideas and grazing management strategies you can contact me contact your extension agent or your NRCS and we'll be glad to help you set up some strategies there so with that I am going to turn it over back over to Dr. Charlie he's going to have some closing remarks and then we can open it up for question and answer all right thank you Miranda and thanks to all our presenters out there we really appreciate the time you've taken and our attendees out there might notice that many of our specialists are doing this from home and so we want to thank you for the opportunity to come into your homes tonight and from ours to yours so this is the question and answer time we have a few questions as we go through these if you have other questions please type them in and so the first question actually I'm going to call on Dr. Stucca and the question is can you feed a hyperthermic calf colostrum I've heard that a calf won't utilize the colostrum until its internal body temp is increased and it will just sit in the calf stomach and cause blow is this true yeah good question and I think when we talk we were talking about the need for colostrum no matter what method you're warming the calf I think I did say sometime during that warming process you need to get colostrum into that calf because you won't have as much success with warming the calf unless that calf has and granted this is warm colostrum so that actually helps a little bit as well so it's just it's every bit as important as your warming method whether it's a hot box or or a warm water bath I'm not telling you to put in the colostrum before you start warming the process but at least sometime during that warming process put colostrum into that calf and it'll help it'll help that calf build his own energy in addition to what you're already providing to warm that calf all right thanks Jerry next one I think Miranda I'm going to call on you what growth stage should cows be turned out and I think the growth stage is with what growth stage should cows be turned out on winter annual pastures such as winter rye so we want to turn it out at the vegetative stage I would use the same rule of thumb as we do for our introduced grasses like the three leaf stage with these if you manage it correctly and don't don't graze it too low you can actually take them off and you'll get regrowth that you'll be able to graze again so managing the grazing and one of the keys with these is a lot of people aren't watching these pastures they have a lot of other things going on so getting them out early enough so you can get that regrowth because once it heads out you don't have that potential for regrowth and there's a serious decline in quality too all right thanks Miranda the next question I have is well this is a toss-up I think I'll call on Dr. Hoppe first but then other panelists can come in on that feeding in late afternoon and early evening I heard is better for calving I was told is this true I'm not sure if it's better for actually calving but if you're looking for calving changing the time frame which cattle calve throughout the day feeding in the evening will tend to delay calving until earlier in the morning you'll end up having less nighttime calvings if you're feeding late in the afternoon or early evening actually the opposite is true in sheep by feeding them within four or five hours you'll end up having more lambs to happen so if you don't you want to get away from nighttime watches and sheep be sure to feed them in the morning if you want to get away from nighttime calving be sure to feed the cattle at night or late evening you'll see you all right thank you carl we're at wow hour and 15 minutes we've been at this and thank you very much and all those attending one last call for questions I'm going to call on the presenters if there's any final comments if anything has come up while you watch each of you present things that you want to make a point of otherwise there's no questions so I'm going to pause for a little bit and see could we share the link for where you can find the feed cost calculator sure Carl if you what oh what we're going to do is at the end of this session and you typed in an email so we should be able to email you we have some other supporting documents that we're going to send to all the attendees that were tuned in tonight so we'll be sending those so if there are anything else put it in the question box if there's something else you want us to send out but we will be sending out that information let's see I'm trying going down my checklist here I think we've covered most everything any other specialists have any final comments or thoughts Dr. Charlie I just I guess I just tell the audience still at this point that we are available our phones are almost always on and so you can get a hold of us and if you have any more questions why we we're willing and able to help in any any way we can thanks Jerry anybody else so I just want to close with thanks oh Dr. Charlie I was just going to say NDSU leads the University of Nebraska Omaha 48 to 39 with 1220 left in the second half and that's to go to the big NCAA tournament thanks Lisa and that's that's great okay so hang on thanks again for zooming with us tonight on behalf of India Extension we wish to wish you the best over the next few days it doesn't look like it's going to be very nice weather out there if you have more questions at a later date please contact your local county based Extension agent they can field your questions or they can also get in touch with us they have all our contact information when this webinar concludes you should be linked to a brief survey to leave feedback for us we are very interested in your experience this evening with us in the use of this webinar technology and we want to learn from you so if at all possible please take a few minutes and give us your feedback and so with that I'm going to say thank you for your time tonight and good night
