 So much of Australia's story is to do with water. There's often too much or too little. Drought is a constant threat. Cattleman Randall Crozier averages just three good years in ten. Yeah, well it's 24,000 square kilometres or six minute acres. Well it's meant to be the size of Belgium, so they say, but I've never been there so I couldn't tell you. Randall manages Anna Krieg Station. The world's largest cattle property. It survives on eight inches of rain a year. If it comes at all. We live in a desert so it always looks like it's dry. Although most of the stuff that grows here is very nutritious. We don't need very much rain to make it spring to life. It's a very productive country if you get the water on it. Across two-thirds of Australia, no rivers flow. Just parched channels flooded fleetingly by rain. Which hasn't come to Anna Creek in four years. When we get a decent rainfall until the dams go dry we've got about probably nine to twelve months maximum. Well that's the way this country is, you know. She's got to learn to live with it a bit and go along with it. You can't go against it. You'll never win. That's it. So you can take all the time to see it. Now let's turn on a large sea shower.

Now that's the last week. Some program to get you disappointed later is 70 déc
