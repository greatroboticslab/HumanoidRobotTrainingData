Howto & Style
 KELOLAI Hey, welcome to Uncle Tim's farm. You're probably wondering what's going on. Well, we're supposed to be getting a bunch of rain, and where these pigs have been living, when that ground gets wet, it is impossible for me to get in there. It basically turns to just grease on the surface. So, I'm having to pull those pigs out of there. For now, well, they're going to be harvested in just over a week. Or, actually, yeah, just over a week. A week from tomorrow, we're going to harvest them. So, I need to get them out of there, because we're expecting a bunch of rain the next couple nights, and then, again, all next week it's supposed to rain. So, that ground would just be way too wet for me to get in there and get hooked up to that trailer. So, I went ahead and pulled them out today, and they're just going to go ahead and live in that trailer for the next week. And I'll go ahead and add some more straw in there. They've had quite a bit of straw put in a water bucket and a feed tub, and that's just where they'll live for the next week. They've already basically been spending 90% of their time in there. They go in there for shelter. They sleep in there. So, it's not going to be that drastic of a change for them. The only thing is, is they won't have access to the pond. You know, get out and roam around and go down to the pond. But, they'll be fine for the next week. And this way, I am sure that I have them out of there so that we can harvest them next week. Okay. I'm going to go to Bed기를. There was so much other comfort bathroom, like notebooks, driving according to a police station wprowadgeordnets located at 24 maintains a нашем site. We did it in our car!
