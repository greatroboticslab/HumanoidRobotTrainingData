Howto & Style
 Oh yeah, today is the big day for these two fellas. Harvest time. They've reached their potential or what I'd like them how large I'd like them to be I'm guessing they're right around 300 maybe just over. Getting ready to go over and harvest them both. We'll head over to my friends with them here and we have our own processing facility that we have built and so go ahead and get them taken care of. Well it turns out both of these hogs weighed exactly 300 pounds. That's pretty amazing that they came out exactly the same. As you can see here we don't scald and scrape our hogs we just go ahead and skin them. It's a much simpler process for us this way. Two pigs hanging in the cooler. They both weighed exactly 300 pounds. Pretty amazing. They weighed exactly the same and you're wondering why that one's hanging a little different than the others because somebody made a mistake cutting off that hind leg and cut the Achilles tendon or whatever you want to call it where you normally hang them like this right here. I won't mention any names but it was me. Anyhow, so we've got two pigs hanging in the cooler and we'll go ahead and get them processed and packaged tomorrow. time to make some sausage. We grind our sausage twice and this is the second time through. This helps get it into a finer consistency as well as mix all the seasoning. Two pigs fill up a freezer. Not quite all the meat. It's most of it. Well it's a good portion of the meat but I still have a whole pile of the sausage to put in here. Actually none of the sausage is in here at the moment. So there's another 80 pounds of sausage to go in here so that will fill this freezer completely full. And this is a 7.1 cubic foot freezer. So two 300 pound hogs will fill a 7.1 cubic foot freezer pretty much right to the brim and that doesn't include the lard or the bones that I'm going to use for bone broth. So including that two whole 300 pound pigs would not fit in this freezer. They would definitely overfill it. This is what two processed pigs look like in the freezer. The
