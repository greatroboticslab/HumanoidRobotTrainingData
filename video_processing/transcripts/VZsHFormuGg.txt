 We have over 2,000 pigs. 2,000 pigs. Why did you leave the UK to come to Nigeria? Why must I settle abroad? The passion in me as an entrepreneur, I believe in settling in Nigeria, work with Nigerians, achieve whatever I want to achieve. All my life, I've never had a time that I say, I have like one week holiday. I see myself working every day. Every day that I see myself, I do. I know the body is not feeling fine. We breed pigs. And also run production of livestock feed. And I'm happy that today here has produced a lot of farmers and people have heard about us from nook and cranny of the state and neighboring states. This is the biggest pig farm in Platou State. What's up guys, Simon Aramelfim Segin and welcome back to the channel. Today we are bringing you a wonderful video and we are here at PO Gas Pig Farms. We are here with the CEO, engineer Ude. Ude. Yeah, thank you. It's nice to meet you, sir. Me too. The pleasure is mine. My name is Obin Naude. I'm the MD, Bio-Ogas Farms and Industries Limited. Basically, we breed pigs and also run production of livestock feed. This is what we do here. We're trying to see how we can bring things together that we can offer what governments are not doing, what we heard about them doing before, but they don't do it again. In form of employment, in form of start-up of business, in form of a forum where people can come and see how they can start up their own businesses. And I'm happy that today here has produced a lot of farmers in this place and people have heard about us from nook and cranny of the state and neighboring states as a matter of fact, and to the glory of God, I think this is the biggest pig farm in Platou State. God is helping us. We are striving and going higher and higher. Our vision is that one day, our farm will be one of the best farms in terms of scope, in terms of best practices in West Africa. We are competing, want to compete with global services, best services so that we can offer the best to our customers and end users. and also bringing all the potential farmers on board. There are young guys, instead of waiting for white collar jobs, who actually there are some things we can do on our own, that can provide employment, that can maybe make weight by what we do. So this is the place, this is the arena.종 Pak Tube cont Horn So where are we now? Okay, this is one of the Pens, one of the Pens? Thisото!!!! We have the A, B, In Pensilc we have piglets, and we domicile piglets Piglets. Yeah. So let's go and see this. So we have to sanitize? Yes. We have to sanitize. So these are our piglets. When our piglets are at a certain age, basically four weeks, we tend to win them. Wow. I like how organized everything is. Yes. Yes. Like I told you that this is the work we do. You can see how clean the environment is. How many pigs do you have in total? Well, we have over 2,000 pigs. 2,000 pigs? 2,000 pigs? Yes. You have different breeds or they are all the same breeds? No, no. We have different breeds. We have breeds like Duroc, we have Hampshire, we have Landrys, we have Large White. We have Camboro, we have Cross Duroc, we have Danish protests. We have a lot of them. In total, that's like how many breeds? We have like over 10 breeds. 10 breeds. That's a lot. Yeah. So how did all of this start? How did you start all of this? Well, this place started very far back in 2020. 2020. The COVID year. COVID year. So we found ourselves in the house and locked ourselves up. But before then, don't forget we have a lot of people who are locked inside the house. So we are deeply into construction industry. So at that time, government and other business agencies shut down their shops because of the COVID. So we found ourselves in the house and locked ourselves up. But before then, don't forget we have workers, employees under us. So every month, employees will put a phone across and say, what about our salary we have not seen? So as a man, don't work. Don't work. Don't work. As a man, we must pay because if you don't pay, they will come and look for you at home. And based on that, we have worked, we have a cordial relationship at work. We cannot deny them. So I have to think which way forward. We think outside the box and say, there's need for us to start something. So that we now notice that what we do is what we should tell ourselves the bitter truth, that we don't have any permanent work. We only had a temporary work because a contract work is a temporary work. So we started year 2020, start building. During the COVID, we will come here, we put blocks. We started from the other side. We put blocks, just one block, two blocks, three blocks. And at the end of the day, we have about over 10 pens. This is Pen F. What do you have in Pen F? We have growers. Growers. Okay. When you say growers, what do you mean by growers? Growers are those that have matured from piglet issues. Okay. So they have grown, they have weaned. They have matured, so they have matured. So that in this area, this place, you now see the pig tend to appear, and expand some maturity stage. In their body. They have to be in their body. So they are now becoming independent from their mother. their mother they tend to become a mother or father what's the average a pig can give them like average numbers okay a pig can average of 10 10 okay does it depend on the grid or all of them mostly large white and large we have goodness 19 yeah this place we've moved next 22 22 yeah but average 10 10. so they can give birth to 8 6 12 14 5 it depends on nature we have also with nesb giving birth to one one i'm justin in the business my name i am the or the honors representative i act in the capacity of the md in case if it's not available so where are we meal yes that's what do you do in the warehouse this is where we compound our feed okay your food so you make your feed your own self okay for example what we have here is the wheat offer wheat offer yes so these are fields yeah these are feeds okay this rice bran over here we have the the soybean the soybean is okay so there are a lot of additives that are involved that i will not mention mentioned during uh formulation so that's what we do here to make ensure that we have a quality feed that we give to our pigs to make it sure the way you have seen them eyes they are quite healthy yes yes that's what we do here yes these are machine for mixing and this here is the machine for grinding grinding grinding the mix the ground this is ready those are the two major things that this machine does that there is the mixer where all the additives are putting together and i mix them with bag them okay so if we start to customers okay you sell this to how much does the bag of this course i may not give a head because we buy in tons in tons okay what are the major challenges you faced in piogas like i said the challenges we face is economy our economy our economy is harsh in nigeria as a whole you buy something today tomorrow you will not get it and the people your customers would not tell you how much you buy raw materials all they are concentrated is this is the price you have placed this if you are saying you are selling a kg of pork 1,005 it should be 1,005 irrespective of other add-ups in raw materials for example we have raw material we use like maize and other grains a bag of maize it goes for 60 000 per bag of 100 kg so by the time you compound all and other elements other raw materials that will go the one we imported by the time you compound them together and see how much a kg of feed goes you will not able to sell a pork the cost price that is i'm talking of the the the the production cost will not be less than 2 000 per kg and if you sell it you will not see people that patronize you so we are struggling to to come out considering our production costs we are struggling to pay our overheads our bills because the cost of production is high so it's a huge challenge if our economy will be fair will be better that things are easily accessible easily bought then other people can even come on board so that is the major challenge we face like i told you recently that we are blessed with customers from across the neighboring states like kaduna abuja nasarawa benway anambra and other states it's because we we don't look at that cost i was telling you we are looking at how can we bring more people on board because i believe the greater we are into this business the better for us we subsidize our rates we bring it down and allow other people so long you have that passion to be in business we don't look at the monetary aspect of it we look at how we can help you to start up your business so because if we want to look at how much we spend to raise a peak a piglets we may not sell so we look at what is possible how if we have break even on the cost of breeding a big to a certain level we are good to go so like piglets we have the one we can sell at low at 25 000 30 000 depending on the breed we have also a breed of 60 000 we have breed of 140 000. what was the highest amount of pigs that's the one i'm telling you 140 000 piglets okay so it depends on the uh on the breed yes okay so what of bigger pigs how do you sell them okay okay okay we're talking about lightweight we sell 1000 we sell 800 depending what you are buying now we sell one two depending the the the the quantity you are buying if you're buying in large scale large scale we sell we reduce money if you are just buying fuel it depends but ranging from 800 to 1200. what's your advice to someone wanting to venture into pig farm or any business at all in nigeria i say that young particularly the younger ones we shouldn't because our government have disappointed us we shouldn't be lamenting in our government as a result of bad leadership you understand we should we should roll our sleeves and come on board look for something you can do it might not be pig farming it might be crop farming it might be another venture you want to do don't give up roll your sleeve come out and see what we can do and i'm also extending this venture to other entrepreneurs let us see how we can touch lives let us see how we can touch lives by bringing people around us anybody that shows passion in this business we encourage them by helping them to start up that business and a couple of them have been sending messages and prayers that is enough for me as far as i'm concerned they pray for me every day by day god bless you god bless you god bless you you are the reason why this business is still functioning today and we are good i know tomorrow god or someone god has put in a position will remember us yes that's my belief so i call on you i call on other people friends let them come on board let them come patronize the pure gas come and be partner with pure gas we offer training services here we are consultants here too even other people who have farms and they're having issues we have professionals you know medical professionals around us who can offer a better advice and revive their farms we don't want to see any farm that winding down
