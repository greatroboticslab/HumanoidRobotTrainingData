 So it's generally when you involve an eating intermediary and that's because the end buyer wants some transference of trust and they trust the USDA more than they trust a buyer, a grower that they're never going to meet. And when you start looking at GAAP, there are slightly different types of GAAP. There's GAAP specifically for mushrooms, for tomatoes, for aquaponics, and for a few other things. And there are certain like categories within GAAP. So there's the harvest step or the production step, like field production. There's the harvesting or pack house. And then there's post harvest handling. And less, I don't know about you, because I think at some point you would wash your sunflower shoots, which would probably be considered post harvest handling.
