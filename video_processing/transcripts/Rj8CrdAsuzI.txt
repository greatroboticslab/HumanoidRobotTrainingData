 Hey Food Foresters, Amy here and today we are going to harvest our Virginia Jumbo Peanuts that we got from Essence Family Gardener or aka the Sapper Gardener. Sorry if I messed that up. Rob. Rob, yes. So we planted peanuts through this whole raised bed here. Now unbeknownst to us some of our yellow Mexican sunflower seeds happen to get spread in here and so these will transplant these somewhere else but I'm not going to worry about bringing them, pulling them up right now. But for the peanuts, it takes about 90 to 110 days and what you want to do is when the leaves start to start turning yellow here, that's when you want to harvest them. So I got my basket and we're going to go ahead and pull a couple out and then also too when we get done picking the peanuts off the leftover. All right, when we get done picking the peanuts off of the roots, what we're going to do is we're going to take these tops and we're going to go ahead and give them to our animals as a treat. So let's get started. Okay, so as you can tell these are very tall because this bed is a little low but I'm going to find one here. I don't know if you can see this. There's some peanuts. All right, let's pop one open and see if it's... Well, let me pull out this one. I just broke it off the root. You should be, we should be using a fork. I'll have to get one, a little tool but... You look well. Let's see if the bean inside is... Good. Yeah, see if the peanut is fully formed. Crunchy? Crunchy's good. Crunchy's good. Yep. Hold on. Let me get it. Yeah, it looks like it's filled up. That's good. Yeah, it's good. Hold on. Let me get my gloves off so I can peel these. I want to see and try one. Of course, I know it's going to be all natural. It's probably not going to taste like a roasted peanut. There we go. You're going to have a little bit of green. I'll have a little dirt with it. Dirt don't hurt. Dirt. All right, so there's the peanut out of the shell. All right, here it goes. Definitely has the peanut taste. It's like... It doesn't... it's not really an earthy taste though, but it's good. It's different. It's more like a... Like an unsalted peanut basically. Not boiled. Not cooked. Not roasted. We're going to boil these up and probably freeze them. Eat some and probably freeze them. But, uh... Hey, let me try that one. You want to try that one? Here, let me get your reaction. I don't know about eating a green peanut though, but... Not bad. No, not bad at all. I need some salt. Tastes like a big raw harder green bean or something. Yeah. But, not bad. But, not bad. Not bad at all. All right, so... Let's, uh... Pull out some more here. You know what? Hey, um... In our little tool shed here, I think down at the bottom is one of those fork things and a shovel. You want to go grab it? That's not a peanut. But, this one is. Got some peanuts in it. Yeah, got peanuts in it. I mean, they are coming... It is coming up really loosely. Yeah. I mean... Holy cow. Oh my god. This is so exciting! Look at that! Did you shake off the dirt in the thing? No, no, in the... What? Ah, you get so excited. You're dumping dirt everywhere. And dumping dirt everywhere. Oh, look at all those peanuts. Look at all those peanuts! This is so awesome! All right, let me pick some. This basket ain't gonna be big enough. We might have to pick them out here. Yeah, let's do that. Pick them off. Let me, um... Hold on, because there was some that fell off, so... I just want to make sure, because it went... Oh, look at that nice big worm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right, guys. All right. We're gonna start picking them. All right, so... Yeah, I'm gonna start separating them and putting them in here, but we may need a smaller basket, because this basket's got a lot of holes in it, so... We may have to grab something else. Okay. All right, we'll see you in a little bit. What you doing, Amy? Picking peanuts! Picking peanuts! So... Now, just so you know, it's July. Today's supposed to get up to 104 with the heat and the humidity, so... Sweating and breathing heavy, not a good combination. At least not outside. All right, so as you can tell... This is our pile so far. This is what we're gonna be giving the ducks and the turkeys and the chickens, some nice little treats. Donald's been pulling this up in sections. We got one small section left, but... As you can tell... Now, you can cure these by hanging them to dry, but we're going to be roasting them right away, and also we're going to be... Boiling some too. Boiling them, so we're not going to bother with curing them. We're going to go right to cooking them. Now, just for you guys to know, what we're going to do is we're going to let this bed rest for a week. We're going to add some nice topsoil to it once I'm able to get the rest of this stuff cleaned out. Because you can tell we got dollar weed in here and it went crazy. And then we are going to go ahead and plant another crop of these jumbo peanuts. We still have some leftover. And then that way come near the fall, we'll have another harvest of the peanuts. That's one good thing about Florida. We have a very long growing season. Long and hot. So we should... So we're attempting to get a second season out of these. We ain't guaranteeing we can, but it's a good experiment to see if we can. And they did so well in this bed, we just got to replenish it. And I think what I may do is... I may take one of these Mexican sunflowers, do the chop and drop. That's going to add in that nitrogen back into the soil. Because... I don't know if we want to do it with all these seed pods on these. Yeah. I'd rather chop and drop them someplace else. Okay. I don't want more... I don't want to end up with the same thing with Mexican sun. Well, to be honest with you, this is the first year we've been able to grow them. I've planted these all over the place before. And just got little itty spindly ones. And just got little itty spindly ones. I mean, they're everywhere. And look at all the butterflies. Yeah. The butterflies love them. Yeah. Look at the butterflies. See them? They don't... All right. Sorry, I don't take camera directions very well. No, you don't. I don't take directions period very well, do I? You try. You try. That's why I always hear, yes, dear. See, even the turkeys are laughing at you. Oh, here's a flower. What's left of one? Is that a flower or just a yellow leaf? I think it's a flower. That one doesn't have a shell. Nope, it's a petal of a flower. All right. And then all I do is I just double check before I lay it down. Just make sure we got all the good ones. Because Donald likes these little itty bitty ones that have little tiny shells on them. I eat them whole. I don't even husk them. When I boil those, I'll just eat those shell and all. Okay. One more small row. So, Amy. So, Amy. Yep. One more small row. So, I'll show you how he does it. And they just come right out. Yep. You just pull gently. And these little runners, that's what these are. These will have them. Yep. Too. Too. Well, that's how they, that's how the flowers fall. Yep. Because the stem of the flowers. That's got a lot. Yeah, that's a good one. I think. I just double check in the soil. Yeah. Make sure I didn't. Miss any. That one didn't have a bunch. That's okay. Something's better than nothing. One more plant. A couple more. Yeah. And a weed. Woo! Yeah, the weeds hold the plants in pretty good. Just double check that. Make sure there's no. Throw that in the ditch. Oh, there's a peanut. A couple more. Once these dollar weeds get into a bed. Yeah. It's almost impossible to get them out. Got a few more there. Yep. All right. All right. Smooth that out. And then, uh. Do you want to smooth that corner over there out? Yeah. Or that hole over there. Yeah. As you can see, dollar weeds are pretty easy to pull out. It's almost like they're just roots. And literally, you pull on one and almost the whole thing comes out. So. See. Throw that over the fence. All right, guys. So, we're going to go ahead and finish harvesting this. And then we're going to take it inside. Hey, guys. If you liked that video, hit that like button. Remember that bell. And subscribe.
