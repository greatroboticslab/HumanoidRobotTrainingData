 We let the grasslands heal as much as possible. Our rotational grazing plan really varies from year to year. Some years I want to try to introduce cool season grasses. Some years I want to introduce legumes that I've planted, like the Sizer Milk Fetch and stuff in the big bluestem. We're not on a set pattern. We try to shift it up every year, hit a different paddock. The last few years we've been making smaller paddocks, finding it a lot more even grazing, a lot more thorough grazing, getting grazing on the noxious weeds. Our grasslands, we're usually off of those by the 1st of November, and then we're moving on to our cover crop and crop residue. I think about the latest we've had our cows out was February 1st. We had to bring them home and start feeding. We ran out of places to graze. We let the grasslands heal as much as possible.
