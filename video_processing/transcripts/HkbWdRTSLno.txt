 This sample query shows how to select different time windows for different layers. In this specific example we're going to look at agricultural data for the Midwestern US. Specifically we're going to compare the crop planting information together with some weather information. Let's get started. Initially we create a new query. We select from survey, right here, the 250 meter resolution crop planting map. This is from the US Department of Agriculture. From the weather category we select prism historical data. Let's pick the daily maximum temperature for example. Okay. So now when it comes to where, the prism data is only available for the continental US. Therefore you see here the contiguous US has been highlighted already for us. Now we can zoom in maybe a bit and select a rectangle somewhere here in the Midwest like this. Now as to the where, if we take this option off, we can see now we're going to allow to change the data. Now we're going to allow to choose different time windows for these layers. Okay. So for the crop type, let's simply pick January 1st, 2017. And for the maximum temperature, let's pick something like June 2017. Okay. So the idea would be roughly speaking that from the crop type one knows what has been planted there. And then one might want to be interested in the temperature to see, you know, what these crops could possibly develop. So let's pick next. We don't do any aggregation for this. Give this name and submit it. So this is very straightforward. To give an idea what the result looks like, we ran this query previously. So let's click on this here. So you see indeed, we have the crop layer. Note that the crop type is categorically encoded. The codes pretty much correspond to these numbers. You see here with this color scheme. If you click on a single point, you can basically see the value here. And these numerical codes are consistent with USDA codes. Okay. So similarly, we could of course select our temperature, which we've, you know, picked here. And again, you click on a single point. We also get the complete time series at this point. At the same time, you can launch an animation for this. And see how the temperature devolved, evolved during the month of June. Take a real life to make sure these temperatures expand for a Rick and props vibe. If you tap into the name of Rick and Max were working on, I'd not perk on you thedauses. I got this 얘는 and she said, you may be the one size fy thing in theходит blog. And it's all creating the reason for bringing up Nep and Bent, are 300. And to give you the number of moves, then, that's worse for him.
