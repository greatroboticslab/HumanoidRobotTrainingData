 Hello, my name is Irae Manuel, the lead maker for the Gravity Fed Modular Regulation Kit Prototype. In this project we are collaborating with students from Pagreña Secondary School, who are also members of the School Science and Innovation Club. Our project is at the completion stage and we are now documenting it. The critical making is about making things that are aimed at solving challenges of the community. Our intended beneficiaries are the vulnerable refugees to support them with this Gravity Fed Modular Regulation Kit, so that they can be able to grow basic food crops in times of reliable rainfall and also during dry seasons. This will help them to improve on their nutrition, their overall wellbeing. So in a sense that our making is a small contribution towards the sustainable development goals of UN. Yeah, so we would love to produce as many of these kits as possible.
