 G'day everyone. You may have heard some whispers about a new design of our Ripper Pipe Player. Well I'm glad to present that to you today. So our Ripper Pipe Player has always carried great strength and this new design is no different. Some of the main features you can see is the square reel as opposed to our round reel. The reason for going to square was to give the reel centre lower to the ground. This makes it easier when you're loading those larger rolls of pipe. Another feature we've added on is a fork pocket to make it easily forkable. So there's two fork pockets on the Ripper so if you've got to move it from property to property it's a lot easier to load onto the back of the ute or trailer. We've also made our legs on the Ripper more efficient and easy to store. If you have any questions on this great product feel free to reach out to the team today. Thank you. Bye.
