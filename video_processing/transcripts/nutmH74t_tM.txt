 Oftentimes as homeowners we're required to use pesticides to control certain problems, those problems being insects, diseases, and weeds. And so once you've chosen the product that you're interested in using, the important thing to do is read the label that comes with the packet. If you find that the label is difficult to read or difficult to understand, you can actually go to the internet and type in in your web browser that product's name and then the word label and you can get a more readable version of that particular product's information. Some of the information that's included in the label that you need to be aware of is the active ingredient, the statement about first aid, and if you happen to have a problem where you are required to go to the medical facility and be treated, you probably need to take the label with you. And hazards both to animals and to yourselves that are included in that particular product. There might be particular statements about bees and how that product would affect bees. And then specifically it'll start to get into the directions for use. And then finally there'll be information on storage and disposal. And so what you want to remember when you buy a product, it's really important to read and understand and follow that label that comes with it in order for you to apply that product correctly. and then be able to dispose of that container when you're done with it.
