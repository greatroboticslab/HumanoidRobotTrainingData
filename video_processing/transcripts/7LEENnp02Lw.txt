 All right everybody, this is Ross. I thought in today's video we would talk all about pruning fruit trees and not just you know these peaches behind me here but also a lot of the stone fruits, a lot of the apples, the pears. We'll probably look at the persimmons and we may even look at the grapes as well but I want to just cover pruning and show you some of the pruning I've been doing over the last week or two. I've already at this point come over the trees about two or three times and have made my cuts. I've come back again later and then made more cuts and have re-evaluated the trees and I thought it would just be you know rather than just showing you guys this whole process of every cut I made, I think that's an entertaining video but I don't think it's a very educational video. I wanted to really just show you guys the shape of the trees now. This I think is worth more than just showing you where the cuts are. Let me show you and talk about why I made certain cuts on these trees so that you can get an understanding, you know, you can get the blueprint, you get the book, the manual so that when you actually do this at home on your own trees this makes a lot more sense to you. We're going to show you guys older trees, younger trees, trees of different sized rootstocks and many different species of trees. So these are the Aspiaid peaches. The only real way that peaches work and every tree is different is if you renew the wood every year, right? You have to have one year old wood to get the fruit buds. So this is one year old wood. You can tell by the color of the wood. It's typically a redder color and the older it gets it becomes more gray or more brown. So you need to have one year old wood but if if you have a tree as an example that's in Aspiaid, which is really not what you should do, or even if you had a tree that was a vase shape, you still have to renew that wood. It doesn't necessarily matter what the form is. You got to make sure that you can set up a system and that's kind of what I've done up here at this top tier, right? We have three tiers in this Aspiaid system. You have to set up this open vase, open vase shape because you're going to be able to renew the wood a lot easier that way. Now as an example, we've already cut out a number of these big scaffolds here, big branches that were three or four years in age. So you can see this one here. This branch is probably three or four years old as well. And there's a number of these. These are probably two or three years old. This one back there is probably four years old. This one coming out in front of me that actually is quite a nice branch. I like this one, how it leans outwards, getting that sunlight and opening up that center of this top tier. This is probably four years old as well. So, um, you know, some of these scaffolds on a typical tree and we're going to look at that typical shape in a minute of what a, what a peach tree really should look like. Um, when you have something like that, you know, you want to be able to take out these scaffolds at a certain age to thin this out and then have the scaffolds renew and replace themselves over time. So these younger ones here are coming in to take up this space, but at some point having both of these two right next to each other, or maybe even this one right next to this one, it's just not going to work. We're not getting enough light. We're not getting enough airflow. And especially in the summer, I mean, if you can imagine these trees, I've done a great job this year of opening up that center. You can throw something right through that. But even in the growing season in the summer, this is going to fill itself in real quick, right in that center. So you got to come in here. If you want good fruit quality, you want less disease pressure on your fruits and even on your trees, you got to come in here and thin out the center and even keep up with that during the summer. So that's what I've kind of focused on this, this bottom layer here of a spayase. Typically what I like to do, no matter what the species is, have the branching come outwards and sort of downwards. And that way it can, you know, take up this lower space. It's easy to harvest. Even if I were to cut off everything up here, I still would get a great harvest from what's below. And it would get good light, you know, in that sense. But if you're going to have this upper stuff, again, and this is exactly what I focused on is cutting this stuff out in the center and making big cuts. You know, we cut out a scaffold there, we cut out another scaffold right there and there. Smaller cuts actually on those trees or on those branches. And I've kind of thinned this out a bit more. What I probably should do is even consider this again, is because right here we have one, two, three potential new scaffolds that are coming in of a similar age. I don't need all that. You know, even this branch here kind of is shaded out by this taller thing, this taller system, excuse the camera, right above it. So again, this one here is kind of shaded out by this right here. And if you kind of picture this, it's hard to imagine. But this whole thing right in this area is kind of a mess. So that's just the struggles, you know, and it's better, I think, to cut out more than less because, you know, like I said, all this stuff down there at the bottom would give me so much fruit. I mean, how many peaches can you possibly eat in a season? I mean, it's crazy how many peaches I get. We're talking this year, probably it's going to be easily in the thousands. So how can I eat that many? Also, I don't want to preserve that many or really any at all. So the best thing I can do is give them away, but giving away, you know, hundreds of peaches, peaches, you know, that can be a difficult task. Unless you got like a food bank or something. So, you know, I don't know, to me, it's just not worth it to have all this disease pressure up here that then lowers the fruit quality on the entire tree. You know, it's all about getting that light, not just, you know, having that open center because that gets you the light in the center. It makes use of the most photosynthesis on these trees, right? You want to be able to have every single leaf getting photosynthesis. That is going to give you the most amount of sugars and carbohydrates the tree can generate to then put that into the fruits. And you're going to see that in the measure of your bricks. If you were to take the bricks, squeeze out some juice, put it on a refractometer, you would see a higher bricks. Just by having a more open center, having more photosynthesis hit your tree, that's absolutely critical. The other big benefit is the airflow, which then you have less disease pressure, right? So it's a no-brainer. On the peaches, you get something called rot and it happens all the time in these humid climates. It's so hard to fight and you could fight it with sprays and other things that you might want to do, but just having the right form can go such a long way. I mean, it's almost impossible to avoid it. But like I said, if you get the right form and if you, if I cut out more up here than probably, I really should come in here again. I need to come in here again to these trees specifically. They grow so quickly. They're standards. I need to thin this out even better than I have. I'm going to get the best fruit quality possible. And this Alberta, that's what this tree here is, is here on the right, did not fruit and has never really fruited that well in terms of its fruit quality, right? It's put out plenty of fruits, but the quality has never been up there. And I wonder if, oh, well maybe it's a lot to do with the way I was pruning my trees. You know, it's crazy. You think you know about pruning until you really get a crop of peaches or a crop of plums and they're just a disaster. You know, um, here over here, let's see, this is a younger persimmon tree and this guy is getting its form. This is proc. Um, I probably could cut this out, but I'd rather, you know, get all the fruit I could, but this is the main leader here. And I've made a cut there to cut out that central leader, open this up a bit more. You could see the scaffolds one, two, three, four, and we have some, uh, scaffolds up here. Potentially if I want to cut out something lower down on the tree, like this one probably will come out in the future as it might be a bit more shaded than the others, just based on the angle of the sun. This is kind of the standard thing, right? You want to get your tree, grow it up and, uh, don't be afraid to cut it. You know, that single stem whip, as an example, don't be afraid to make that cut. Do I have any single stem whips at this point? I mean, this is kind of, here's a young Seijo persimmon here. It's just the main whip at this point. There's some branching here at the top. I just really want this thing to grow. It's been taking a while to get established, but, uh, you know, that's, it's very similar thing is that you want it to grow up as a single stem whip, cut it back at a certain height, maybe around your knee, maybe at your waist, depending on how tall you want your tree. Same thing over here with this quince. This guy actually got killed back, by some branching that fell on it, uh, from the, the shade tree above. You can see that big shade tree there. It's the same thing. You want to make your cuts, bring it back to a lower height, and it'll start sending out these branches. So even though I have, you know, two nice branches here on the left and right, what I want to do is actually take off the tips. And what I probably want to do is even bring it back even further at a lower height and really get that branching to come in at a lower point. Um, the, no more spi-a's over here. This is more traditional sense, younger trees. These are plums of what you might actually want to do with the, with your spi-a is actually grow something that should be a spi-a to plum. Um, it's very similar situation having the lower growth down here, forming this open center at the top. And even if I wanted to, I could bring this, these branches way back and have some lower, uh, branching here, keep that in check in the summer, rather than letting this grow all summer, just keeping it in check. And I would get nice plums. I don't have to have crazy sized, the spi-a trees, right? They don't have to get like that. You know, I think it's nice to have all that fruit, but, um, you don't really have to do that. You don't have to maintain the trees like that. I could, if I really wanted to, like I said, bring back that top layer in the summer. I mean, we're talking about winter pruning right now, but to be honest with you, summer pruning is really important. And I think it's, um, something I'm really, really going to focus on this year on all of the trees. You know, I think it's important to get them established and not really worry too much about summer pruning where I'm at. Maybe in a longer season climate, that'd be something you would do. Uh, but getting them established, I think you could just do that in the winter by keep cutting them back to a lower height, getting that branching that you want. Keep doing that over time. You're going to see success. The birds are, uh, they're out and about. It's just so warm out right now. And then if I bring you guys over here, I want to show you these two plantings. This is really critical. I think you'll learn a lot from these two. Here's actually, by the way, two of our cherries, the white gold and the black gold. Just cut out the center. That's all I really did. Made sure I even cut out the center within the trees themselves to have even more of an open center. I made a big cut right in there. I think I need to actually get a saw and chop that out. I forgot about that. But, uh, opening up the center of the trees, but also making sure there's nothing here in the middle. You know, even in the future, probably cutting out some of this other stuff that's going towards each other. You got to keep that center clear. And this is a really good example over here because these trees are my plums, um, plumcots and apricots. So these are all very similar in how they fruit. And you can see I've done a, an interesting thing here that, you know, Dave Wilson nursery has promoted and other people have recommended where you plant a lot of trees in the same hole. And you can see, look how many of those white things down there at the bottom there is. There's quite a bit. There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. There's eight trees in a very small area. Um, you know, it's just not something I would recommend. It's, it's difficult to maintain. You don't really need to do this. You plant one tree in the center and then you graft all the varieties onto that one tree. Probably a standard is the way to go. And, um, I think that's a little bit more difficult for the average person, but it's way more difficult, I think, to maintain this. And especially if you don't plant the trees correctly. So this one here, you can kind of see this tree is, uh, I think my satsuma or this might be the, um, let's see here, Santa Rosa. So this is the Santa Rosa plum. And this guy was just planted too much in the center of this planting. So it's kind of occupying weird space. And I've had to force the branching outwards because you don't want anything in the center, right? You want to be able to throw that hat through the middle. You want to be able to even stand in the center. This is going to fill in probably quite a bit in the summer. Got to keep on top of that, as I said, with the peaches, but, um, this is kind of just positioned poorly, I think. And then even this plum cot, this one here behind me, I don't even have the tag is now gone. Might be somewhere down here, but, uh, this guy was planted even, even in an even worse position, excuse me. And I'll show you guys actually what I mean, if you can see that. So ignoring these two trees, this is a bit weird because there was one here that died. So this one was growing out this way, but you see what I'm saying here is that this is supposed to be clear and this tree should be more over here. That was the Santa Rosa we looked at. And then this tree back here, this plum cot is right in the center of the whole damn thing. And that's just not good because this thing is now occupying all that space in the center. And I've really had to focus on pruning all the growth that was growing out this way or growing out in, in just the wrong direction. And this tree is in a sense kind of paying for it. Um, last year, and this is why I've really come to this realization, you know, just with the peaches, we did a video on the peach trees not too long ago. And the peach, uh, video that we did talked a lot about disease and a lot about that Alberta and how it didn't put out good quality fruit and how it was really fighting with disease over here and this planting that we're going to look at in a minute. This tree here put out hundreds of peaches and it did not, I did not get to eat a single one because of disease. I know bugs plum cacurleo is definitely a big part of that as well, but you know, between the rot and the plum cacurleo, I didn't need a single one. And you know what? They weren't even that good. They were nowhere near as good as they should have been because I couldn't get them to ripen to perfection. And also because the tree was heavily shaded. It was not getting the photosynthesis. It wasn't getting the bricks that these plums need. So by opening this up and really pruning out a lot of this tree, pruning out all the center, we should have a lot more success this year with this one. Again, it's just in a bad spot. You know, this Italian prune plum is just odd and how it's shaped and how it's doing, but you know, we're making do with what we've got. And I think this is just a really good example of what not to do. And that's why I'm showing it to you guys, you know, having this tree here in the center, if you're going to do this, here's how you should do it. Okay. This is going to make a lot more sense. Because I have another planting in the front. These are peaches and nectarines. And the peaches and nectarines, in addition to the trees I already have, by the way, it's amazing actually that you can just walk right through the center of this. Look how well pruned that is. I mean, that just looks gorgeous, doesn't it? It's just a little bit. Now this is the back side. This is the north side of the planting. The sun comes from over here on this side of the house and then finally sets over here west. So the sun is really coming through here like this. And what you want to do, again, is be able to walk right through this. I can stand in here. There's no issue whatsoever. So this is kind of what you want to do with these trees is have one planted here. One of these guys, even if you're going to do it like this, which I, again, I don't recommend it. But if you're going to plant this many trees in one hole, here's four and there's two of them behind me, this is how you have to do it. Angle them away from each other. Pretend as if this is a scaffold, this is a scaffold, this is a scaffold, and etc. on one tree. And you know what, these are now a part of that whole system as well. So instead of thinking of this as four different trees, this is now one tree with all these different arms coming out. Again, keeping the center clear and open. That's the only way you're going to get good disease pressure, good airflow, you know, good fruit quality with the sunlight coming in here, getting as much photosynthesis as possible. And that's it. I made some big cuts right here in the center. I'll show you guys. And this is the key. Really has become the biggest thing that I've done with the pruning this year. And I think it's absolutely critical. I would not be showing you guys this if it wasn't. But look, here's a big cut here in the center. Another cut right here in the center. Even these branches here in the center, I've even topped them off and made sure that the growth is growing outwards. Again, all that's growing outwards. And then the same thing behind me. Look, this is a big cut in the middle. This was the biggest and most problematic branch of the entire system because this was a giant scaffold that was way in the center, taking up all this space, all this real estate. Same thing with this one and this one. And that's really all I've done is I've come in here, pruned out the middle. This planting makes a lot more sense. It's going to get a lot more light. The fruit quality is going to be better. But again, I got to keep I got to stay on top of this. Because if I don't stay on top of it in the summer, it doesn't matter. It's going to continue to grow. It's going to continue to do its thing. And those branches are going to fill up the middle. There's prime real estate for the sun in the middle of the trees. So the tree is naturally going to think, oh, I got to fill up that middle space. I got to take advantage of that. But you don't want that. You got to prune out that middle stuff there and keep up with it throughout the summer. That's how you're going to get the best airflow. That's how you're going to get the best fruit quality. So rather than showing you guys, you know, my actual cuts, my actual pruning, I thought this is a lot better to come in here and actually show you guys how I've actually pruned these trees. The pears are a little bit different, but you're trying to get that pyramid shape actually with those. But even, you know, this is just good principles. Every tree is a little bit different, but you're starting out young in a very similar fashion, getting that lower branching, getting an open center in most situations, trying to think about light when it comes to actually pruning your trees and making those cuts. Thinking about airflow, because everything we do is in an effort to promote fruit quality. You could have, you know, 100, 500, 1000 peaches, 1000 fruits, whatever it is. If they're not of a good quality, you're not going to enjoy them. You're going to be actually pretty creeped out. You're going to be pretty down on yourself because your tree is just diseased. The fruits are diseased. All this hard work and all this effort is just finally coming to a point where it's actually a problem. You know, as the trees get older, you're going to realize this. As the trees get bigger, as the trees grow more quickly, this, especially in human places, you're going to realize that's what I have to do. It's going to probably hit you then. Now, I hope it, I hope this got through to you now, but we need to focus on this first and foremost in the beginning. And it's so hard to realize that. So don't be down on yourself, but there's my advice guys. Thank you so much for watching. Take care, hit that subscribe button you got this far and share this with your friends. Somebody, you know, that's just now getting into fruit trees. I'm sure this is a good video for them to kind of understand what is it that I should at least be doing. All right, we'll see you guys later. Take care.
