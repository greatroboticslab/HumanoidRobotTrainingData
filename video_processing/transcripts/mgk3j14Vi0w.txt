In this tutorial, we will walk you through every step from selecting the best Capscum seeds to planting, from test control to harvesting. Now we shall cover the following topics. The Capscum market in Kenya. The best time to plant Capscums in Kenya. The best soil for Capscums farming. The best Capscum variety to grow in Kenya. How to raise Capscum seedlings. Capscums planting and spacing. Capscum fertilizer application schedule. Capscums paste and control methods. And finally Capscums diseases and how to control them. The Capscum market in Kenya. Capscums enjoy a steady demand in Kenya. Particularly in the mass market and grocery stores. Brokers absorb around 70% of the total production. Making it easier for farmers to sell in bulk and secure fast revenues. Capscums prices typically range from 30 shillings to 80 shillings per kilo. Capscums fluctuating based on supply and demand. Capscums are highest during the times of extreme shortage. The best time to plant Capscums in Kenya. For the highest profits. Ideal time to plant Capscums in Kenya is February and September. This allows you to harvest during Easter and Christmas festive season when the demand is highest. Planting this month ensures your crop are ready for harvest when the prices are peak.

The best soil for Capscums farming. Before investing in Capscums farming. Ensure your soil is suitable. Capscums thrive in deep fertile well-drained room soils. Avoid planting in fertile in fields previously used for potato or tomato farming. As these crops share pests and diseases that could damage your Capscum crop. The best Capscums varieties to grow in Kenya. For better yields, choose high yield hybrid Capscum varieties. These are more resistant to diseases and pests. Here are two of the best varieties for Kenyan farmers. Number 1. Maxibel. Maxibel is a popular open pollinated sweet pepper variety known for its heavy fruiting. The fruits weigh around 200 grams and each plant can yield 4 to 5 kilograms. Maxibel matures in about 90 days and has a high tolerance to tomato mosaic virus. Maxibel variety planting density or the planting population is around 900 plants per 240 square meter or 20,000 plants per acre. The good variety for farmers is Superbale F1. Superbale is a hybrid variety with broky lobes and thick fleshy fruits. It has a mild flavor and high resistance to tomato mosaic virus and potato virus. The harvest starts 65 to 75 days after transplanting. It can yield up to 25 tons per acre. How to raise Capscum seedlings? Seedlings establishment is where most farmers fail. Capscum seeds take 4 to 5 weeks to establish. However, this can be accelerated by soaking seeds in an optimizer or seed shooter solution before planting. So seed shallot and cover them with black pepper to shorten the germination period by up to 2 weeks. How to plant Capscum and the spacing? For best results, space Capscum plants 45 cm by 45 cm. This allows for 20,000 plants per acre. Use weld compost farm yard manure and alleviate a thalary before transplanting. After transplanting, drench the plants with insecticides like thunder and a foliar feed like city shooter to protect against cartons and other pests. This is how you should now apply fertilizers from planting to harvesting. On 14 days after transplanting, apply DAP to promote root and foliar growth. 14 days after transplanting, apply NPK-317 to stimulate flowering. 60 days after transplanting, apply CAN fertilizer to enhance fruit enlargement. Additionally, use nitrogen, potassium and calcium foliar fertilizers like Easy Group Vegetative, Advanced K and Curl Max to boost plant health and fruit production further. 15. Capscum Pastes and how to control them? These are the most destructive pests in Capscum farming. Number 1, Lead Spider Mides. These are tiny pests that feed on the underside of the leaves causing yellowing and upward curling. To control them, apply profile at the rate of 10 ml per 20 liters of water or escort at the rate of 8 ml per 20 liters of water. The second pest is hot flies. The second pest is hot flies. Hot flies are stark nutrients from the Capscum plants, hidden in photosynthesis. Infested leaves show white wax material and to control, apply Zander, all profile in six sides, available to obtain 10 ml per 20 liters of water. The third one is cat worms. These are pests that cut seedlings near the soil level. Drench the soil with profile at the rate of 3 ml per liter or Pentagon at the rate of 1 ml per liter to control them. The other one is root, not nematodes. The nematodes cause root swelling, leading to reduced vigor and plant depth. Drench the soil with alonze at the rate of 0.5 ml per liter or marshall at the rate of 10 ml per 20 liters. Capscum diseases and how to control them? The most destructive disease is bright. It is caused by fungus, phytophila capsica that leads to rapid folia, fruit and root rot. To control, apply Ridomil gold at the rate of 50 grams per 20 liters or mistrust at the rate of 30 grams per 20 liters. The best way here is to prevent the infection. The next disease is Downy mildew. This disease causes yellow spots on the upper leaf surfaces and browning, leading to leaf drop and sunburn. To prevent Downy mildew, apply at least Ridomil gold at the rate of 50 grams per 20 liters of water. The other disease is Fusarium wilt. Fusarium wilt is caused by Fusarium oxyspollum. This soil-borne fungus leads to vein clearing, yellowing and wilting. To control Fusarium wilt, drain the soil with absolute at the rate of 10 ml per 20 liters of water. Absolute is a fungicide. The other disease which is very very critical is Bacteria wilt. This bacterial disease causes wilting of young leaves and discoloration of vascular tissues. To control it, apply GreenComp at the rate of 2.5 grams per liter, which is a copper-based product. This will tend to suppress the spread of the fungus.
