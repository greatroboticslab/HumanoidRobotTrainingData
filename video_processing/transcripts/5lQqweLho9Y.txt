 My name is Bev Buckley. I've been growing vegetables and fruit for about the last 14 or 15 years organically and also I teach people how to do this and we've taught hundreds of people here on Mount Tambourine where we live and also now further much further afield through internet courses and one of the things I've found is that the people people generally are very frightened of taking on a new challenge like growing things we've lost the we've lost the the ability to grow because we've not learned it from our parents or our grandparents and this is one of the reasons why books like Annette's Annette Wellsford's How to Grow Healthy Potatoes is a really really valuable resource because it teaches you everything you need to know to grow that crop it teaches you when to plant how to plant what fertilizers to use what what sort of pests to look out for that are going to damage your crops this is why I really really recommend that if you're interested in growing potatoes and of course they're a basic staple crop that we all need that you read Annette Wellsford's How to Grow Healthy Potatoes because that's a really really valuable resource and it will set your mind at ease and allow you to do it with confidence
