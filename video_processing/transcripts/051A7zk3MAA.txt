 And just to give a little bit quick background on the Evaluation and Learning Initiative, as I mentioned, supported by the Climate Investment Fund Administrative Unit as part of the Learning and Evaluation Initiative. The focus of this specific Evaluation and Learning Initiative is on how to finance course-related end prices, with the aim to help improve the viability and scale of investment in sustainable course-related end prices by harvesting lessons from different types of financing models that SIP has been used on the SIP as well as some of the non-SIP investments and applying some of the learning to ongoing and extended forest investments on this SIP. So within that, the course-related end prices is broadly defined. It can range from large scale industrial plantations to family-owned small micro-businesses, income-generating activities, and all the speakers later would speak to this because it's really related. The reason why we define it so broadly is really related to the context of investment in forest sector. And then the early learning that Tom will share with everyone just after me is really generated through some of the early work that the Evaluation and Learning Team has undertaken the time to undertake. That includes one-hour interviews, focus discussions, steps to research, and Tom also visited Ghana and Laos as a case study country. Although because of the resource limitations, we were only able to conduct the interviews and the learning in the sector of those countries. So that's the great background for this initiative. And without further delay, I'll hand over to my colleague Tom, who gave us the first feedback. Thank you very much, Shaating. So just to introduce myself, my name is Tom Blomley. I'm working on the learning initiative, principally involved in work around evaluation. And as Shaating has said, I actually have a chance to visit both Ghana and Laos BDR to review the FIP activities going on there and have a chance to talk to the different stakeholders both within and outside FIP programs to try and get a sense of the financing arrangements and early results that are beginning to flow from those two countries. But as mentioned, there's also been a number of desk studies and other sources of information, interviews and so on. So what I'll try and do very briefly is really summarize some of the very, very broad key areas that are coming out from this. They're very early, they're tentative findings. But we're putting them out there really to try and generate some discussion and get your interest. So really the first slide, what I've tried to do is to categorize in a way the principal financing modalities that the FIP has been using across its portfolio. So these are not in any way, you know, complete list. There are other modalities and so on. But first of all, probably one of the biggest categories of investments or what we're calling enabling investments. These primarily flow through public sector projects to government through grant arrangements. And they provide support to a whole range of policy processes, capacity processes, financial de-risking as well to to some private sector capacity support. So it's those sort of trying to reduce barriers to investment really around a whole range of issues. We've seen in Ghana, for example, the FIP program working on tree and land tenure, which are significant constraints to investment. And within Laos, there's support to timber the FIP program working on tree and plantations. And then the FIP program working on tree and land tenure, which is a large part of the FIP program. And then the FIP program is also a large part of the FIP program. The FIP program is also a large part of the FIP program. It's really support to very low level, micro level, family owned, sometimes informal sector income generating activities. And these are sort of happening within largely within rural communities around forest, rural communities around forest areas. In some cases, they're supported through village loan or grant funds, which then used through a community process to identify and select income generating activities and library based activities. I think the key here is that the emphasis is really on the financial support and the process of selection of the IGA's. But in most cases, and this is, this is again, a general finding and not in all cases, they are, they're mostly around that aspect of establishing the enterprises, but there's relatively little support to business incubation or links to market and market support and engagement in the private sector. The third cluster there is we're calling business incubation with finance. And this is really where technical assistance through tailored grants or credit to small enterprises is supported with business incubation support. It's a relatively small amount of the portfolio. We calculated about 3%. But the work that FIP is doing in Mexico, for example, with community forestry groups and communities there, but also we've seen a spin off project working in Ghana, which is scaling up and taking the work of the FIP program through another donor in this case, DIFID, working on a broader landscape area. And then finally, investment finance only, and this is really just a direct financing to, usually to large scale companies involved in generally in forestry activities. So plantations, this sort of thing, and generally not linked to technical support. So examples of that in Ghana, the support to a Dutch company called Form Ghana who are supporting plantation establishment within the forest reserves. So briefly, just turning to some of the strengths, if you like, of the models that we've discussed, I think what comes out really strongly is that the process of developing national investment plans through a sort of participatory process, which provides a strategic and programmatic flow of investments. I think this is really a unique strength of the support provided by FIP in this area. I think secondly, the anchoring within national government ministries and high up within those government ministries, anchored with people who have significant influencing and decision making authority, provides unique opportunities for particularly these enabling investments we've talked about, leading to public policy, and regulatory. If you look at other non-fit financing mechanisms, it often goes directly to individual enterprises or companies to the private sector. And this broader policy work is much less of an emphasis within the activities. So I think that's a real strength. Thirdly, I think by anchoring within a single ministry, there is this through the strategic aspect of the investment plan, I think in many countries, we're beginning to see these external links to other government agencies, which again provide the enabling aspects in terms of policy regulation, whether it's to do with legality or taxation or support through other sector ministers. So again, I think these are rather unique aspects of the support provided by FIP. Turning to some of the limitations perhaps, I think what we have identified, one of the key areas we've identified, where there's perhaps work still to be done, is on the whole aspect of business incubation and development for small and medium enterprises. We've pointed out the example from Mexico, where actually this is happening, but it seems to be more the exception rather than the norm. So we've seen this strong emphasis on participatory bottom-up identification of income generating activities, which I think is a great strength. But then a limited emphasis on really providing the business development skills, innovation skill, support and market linkages to really enable those micro activities to become sustainable in the long term. I think the second area is limited support, financial services and so on to small and medium producers. So in general, the loans or grants tend to go either at the very bottom to the very small scale family household livelihood activities we talked about through village level funds or grant schemes, or they tend to go to the large scale big companies through IFC or through other MDBs in support of large scale private sector programs. But this middle ground of medium enterprises, I think we've seen less emphasis and this might be something that we can discuss later. The third area, perhaps where there's limited support is to be this sort of aggregation function. So if you've got many, many individuals or groups working on particular subsectors or value chains helping to take that up to a national level to aggregate that to, for example, national or producer organizations, cooperatives and so on, which helps generate marketing opportunities, economies of scale and potential for influencing advocacy. I think finally, we talked in the strength in terms of the FIP in terms of the FIP in terms of the FIP in terms of its anchoring within government and that strategic opportunity in terms of engaging on policy and so on. But I think certainly one area that does come out is by linking so strongly with government, the links to private sector, it doesn't come naturally necessarily to a government ministry. The skills and the techniques and tools to engage with, reach out to engage and enlist to support private sector is not something which is necessarily the first nature to some of the ministry staff. So I think this is a gap that perhaps could be strengthened. Going to the final slide, as Xiaoqing said, we wanted to throw out some questions that perhaps you could keep in mind during the webinar and we can discuss as we go through it and think about as you listen to the other presenters. But building on some of the key findings, I think there are three questions that emerged. One, this aspect of business incubation, in your experience, how do you think FIP could better support that aspect of business incubation to make it sustainable and effective? Secondly, the excellent work in supporting communities and households developing income generating activities, library of support and so on. How can that be really developed further to give that leads to market, to be taken to scale and so on and to be truly sustainable? For example, this work on the apex level organisations, is that something that could strengthen? And then finally, how and when can FIP provide support to these small scale producers and their organisations in ways that can attract additional financing in the farmers, so that we can once again take that to scale? So these are three general questions which emerged from some of the key findings. I think I've run out of time, so I'll come back to chat on that. Thank you very much. Thanks Tom. And the next speaker would be Mark from X3 Life. Mark is the CEO and co-founder of X3 Life, a company providing climate smart lending tools to financial institutions. He's a lawyer and environmental economist. previously Mark was a co-founder and a co-founder of a financial product design at an award-winning mobile phone micro-credit provider. We have quite a lot to share with us on the topic of finance and social services. Someone over to Mark. Hello everybody. Nice to meet you all. As Salting said, I run F3 Life, which provides tools to traditional and non-traditional credit providers to help them incorporate requirements for climate smart agriculture into loan terms. And a system that allows those credit providers to verify visually that those measures are being complied with. And just by way of introduction, I co-founded this company together with a Kenyan colleague Obudai and Gigi. It came out of our experiences negotiating payments for ecosystem services contracts in East Africa, where there was two key realizations. The first was that when smallholder farmers are under contract for provision of ecosystem services or implementing measures to improve delivery of ecosystem services, they are very responsive to those contracts. Secondly, the transaction costs involved with bespoke payments for ecosystem services projects often overwhelm the theoretical good that they do. And really, after the experience of those payments for ecosystem services contracts, we were looking for something that was highly replicable and highly scalable. And this sort of solution that we arrived at in F3 Life was where we arrived at. And this is the system that we arrived at. This is critical to just point out that F3 Life does not provide credit itself. It works with third party providers of credit to smallholder farmers. And under step one of our methodology, when a farmer signs a loan agreement, they also sign an agreement stating how they will manage their land in a climate-smart or environmentally friendly manner. And that can include the planting of trees. Under step two, the farmer repays their loan and also implements the practices that were required under their loan agreement and their land management agreement. So this is where you see farmers begin to respond to the environmental conditionality of their loan terms. Under step three, our systems are used to verify that those practices have been implemented. We use a sort of geotagged smart photograph approach. And they're currently augmenting that with the ability to use drone and satellite imagery to undertake those verifications as well, where appropriate. Under step four, the information that we collect is then scored and then passed back to the financial institution for inclusion within their credit scoring algorithm or credit scorecard. And that then affects the farmers' ability to raise debt in the future. And so what the system sort of creates ultimately is a sort of strong incentive for farmers to transition towards more environmentally friendly practice, more environmentally friendly or climate smart practices. Just to sort of point out that what the system also does is that it attempts to de-risk, from a lender's perspective, farming activities, such that the farmers are more resilient in the events of climate or weather or environmental shock. So it increases the view of the information that the lender has around the farmer and around their farming skill in terms of mitigating that risk. And that's really what our value proposition is. So we're saying to local lenders, to the users of our system, we're saying use the system to both reduce your credit default risk and also to increase your client's debt service coverage ratio, which means that of their ability to raise debt. But there are several other sort of stakeholders in this who we have to sort of, whose incentives we have to align. And that includes funders. And very specifically, what the FD Life system does is create for them an investment proposition with defined financial and environmental returns. We frequently hear the complaints that there's lots of money but there aren't projects. Well, we think that this gets around that project by creating, I guess, sort of investable sort of propositions, buckets for money to be placed within, which is sort of replicable or highly replicable. And then finally, the sort of value proposition for the farmer is that, you know, using, use these practices to reduce your vulnerability to environment or weather shock. And then also hopefully to boost yields. So that's probably what the FD Life system is and what we're seeking to achieve and how we attempt to subtract users to the system. So, we're asked to provide you briefly with a theory of change. I guess it informs our sort of business approach. And this sort of goes a little bit deeper than just the sort of value proposition that I was explaining. Simply put, we understand that environmental degradation is driven largely by economic activity. And that economic activity is, again, largely underpinned by systems of credit, which are blind to natural resource overuse. And what we mean by that is that when a farmer takes a credit, they're obviously compelled to repay the credit with financial interest, with little sort of concern given to how that financial interest is repaid and the effect on the environment of that. So what we see effectively is that there's a systematic problem or systemic problem whereby environmental degradation is sort of baked into the credit and money system. And in response to that, what we're providing is a system which allows, I guess, sort of the negative externalities associated with credit issues to be overcome and to pair financial interest with environmental interest in loan terms. And what we see is that this creates a financially sustainable incentive for environmental restoration. In terms of results, we started with a very limited pilot in 2013-2014, which ended in 2015, with 75 farmers, smaller farmers in Kenya, whereby they were issued with credits with environmental conditions attached over the course of sort of many loan cycles. They repaid loans and progressively built out soil and water conservation systems on their land, systems designed to reduce soil erosion on their land. Soil erosion in that area being associated with increased rainfall, increased heavy episodic rainfall under climate change projections. In May 2016, we won the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Change Finance, which threw us into a cooperation with a number of members of the lab, which includes big donors, big development banks and some investment banks and funds. And together with those, we are slowly now developing three country pilots, Ghana, Rwanda and probably Kenya, for 45,000 farmers to receive the agricultural credit that they would have received anyway, as either working capital loans or input credits with environmental conditions attached. Key barriers and risks. Key barriers and risks. Financial institutions move at a very slow pace. And that's often difficult to manage as a small institution or small business with limited runway essentially. Those financial institutions often have a love-hate relationship with funding agriculture and probably forestry as well anyway. Often their stakeholders are putting pressure on them to fund agriculture, but the difficulties inherent in that sector, they often don't want to do it. And that's often difficult to manage as a small business. And that is only exacerbated by, I guess, actually the solution that we're providing, the challenge that our solution addresses, which is that there are growing concerns about the effect of climate change on the credit worthiness of farmers. Some key lessons learned. And this slide, I guess, presents what we thought would happen coming into this space and then what has actually happened. We thought there would be large amounts of funding for innovation. And in reality there wasn't. But that is very, very constrained. There is a lot of growth stage capital. Social impact investors who we thought would be interested in this space have only really begun to turn their eyes to sort of climate and environmental issues. And in any event, don't really provide innovation capital. They provide growth stage capital. They want to provide funds to organizations that are already showing or that are already revenue positive. And the third thing that we thought would happen is that we could raise funds from our original base in Kenya. And despite the heavy, the high number of financing institutions there, we struggled a little bit because we felt that resource allocation decisions or funding decisions were being made elsewhere. And what happened eventually was that we self-funded limited pilots. And through that initial proof of concept, we won a few prizes, very limited sums, $35,000 in total from Morgan Stanley and Swiss Re. But that was kind of necessary to sort of, or allowed us to sort of conclude our pilots. At that point, the fundraising process was so sort of arduous that we sort of nearly gave up with them. We didn't think the funds were out there. But then we won one of four spots within the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance, which then pushed us into, I guess, the orbit of other funders and large banks who are kind of looking for these types of, I guess, sort of, as I mentioned earlier, defined financial and environmental investment propositions. And also some sort of promise in what we were doing in that respect. That is the final slide. Thank you very much. And we'll just now go on to the presentation, if we could. And the next speaker is Paul from Unique Forestry and Landviews. Paul has been working in forestry for 30 years and has deep understanding of wood value change. Prior to the speaker, in 2016, Paul initiated and left the Uganda's thought of production grant scheme, which he will share now. Right. Hi, everyone, wherever you are. I'm Paul Giacovelli speaking to you from Freiburg in southern Germany. But I'm going to talk to you about the project in Uganda, the Zorlog scheme, where I worked for 10 years at all in 2012. I've just got instructions for time, so I have to go fast to give you a flavour of how the project works. And please ask questions later and I can also point you in the direction for more information should you need it. Right. The background to SPGS. You see those two photos there? The top one is a three year old hybrid eucalypt plantation growing for transmission poles in Uganda. Interesting thing there is the entrepreneur knew nothing about forestry when he started before we supported him. And the bottom slide is a community association that the project supported growing pines, Pines Carabia there, about 2.5 years old. Rotation of course about 15 to 20 years. Right. The background. The background is that it won't be a surprise to those familiar working in Africa. The rampant deforestation, timber shortages predicted. There's been a heavy reliance on wood fuel, of course. Fast growing economy all needs timber. So there was a huge shortage predicted. And this project was looking, seeking to encourage the private sector to invest in new planting. And it assumed that there was small growers who would need financial and technical assistance. The project has been funded by the European Union since it started in 2004. It's invested 24 million dollars to date. A further 16 million pledged in the next four years. The project supports, as you can tell from its name, longer rotations of timber and poles. Right. Very quickly, how does the project work? It's a combination of establishment grants and technical and business support. The establishment grants on the first side, it pays, the project pays 50% of the establishment costs, which at the time was about $425. So the full establishment was $800. It would be more today. But the key thing really is that the grants came, they were performance based. And the standards were clearly written into the contracts. For example, you had to have 80% survival when the programme staff visited after three months. The payment was split into three, into three tranches. So we held back some, the second cheques until a few months to make sure to encourage the people to maintain their crops. So quality is the key. There were no funds paid up front. The grants were only paid in retrospect. So the entrepreneurs had to start with their own money. And we set a minimum of 25 hectares for application. But you could join together to get to that minimum. On the technical side, the business side, we had a very strong extension team, which we developed the first two years with keen young graduates. Took them down to South Africa and Swaziland, showed them the best practices. And also we took some of the entrepreneurs down there too, to give them the vision of how a commercial forest sector looks. We ran some very practical training courses ourselves and the team, as it was very difficult to find that support outside. We published some very practical guidelines after a number of years, which had lots of illustrations of good and bad practices. It went down very well. And interesting, we developed an accreditation system for nurseries and contractors. But that came from, the demand came from the growers themselves, interestingly. So that's been rather successful in building SMEs in the country. And then finally we supported the development of a Timber Growers Association, knowing that it was going to be important in the future beyond the project. And then lastly, the land. Many people started on government land, getting permits for planting. Increasingly they came on private land. Right, theory of change. Here we are. Theory of change. We had identified three key areas, three key assumptions. First of all, that the right incentives will attract the private sector to invest. Secondly, rural livelihoods will be improved. And thirdly, that degraded land will be restored. Now on the basis of those three, the results, we've got 50,000 hectares established to date. And it's getting 50,000 hectares. That's about 450 contracted clients. It's been oversubscribed. And the key thing is that beyond the grant, there's another 30,000 hectares being planted. People often coming for technical advice, not just the finance. On the rural livelihoods, I think another success story really. 5,000, over 5,000 rural jobs created. More than 1,400 people trained on the courses. There's benefits to a lot of the villages with the corporate social responsibility or the bigger companies. And in terms of capacity building of SMEs, we've seen we've got 42 certified nurseries in Uganda now. And 36 small contracting companies going. And then the third one, the degraded land. Well, forest reserves which were degraded are being replanted. And the trees, because they're quality and fast growing, are obviously storing lots of carbon. So I think very positive results there. And in addition, the Soorlog scheme has raised the profile of forestry. People talking about investing in trees as a pension for their children. It shows you it's really getting the message across. And it's attracting interest from other African countries. We've been last year advising the World Bank, setting a scheme up in Mozambique. There's interest in Ghana and in other countries in Africa too on this. Right, barriers and risks. Number one was a challenge for the institutional buy-in. It's been mentioned already a few times. It's been a challenge getting the buy-in despite the pro-private sector policies we see in these countries. Often there is a resistance to change. Number two, sustainability is an issue because it's grant-led the project. So obviously it depends on Overseas Development Assistant, the donors to maintain it. And thirdly is the forestry's big bone of contention, which is the long rotations. But what we strongly believe is that these risks can be managed by good planning and management. And these risks, I think we're going to talk a bit later, are just growing the trees, but in particular the markets for those crops. Right, working with UNIQ in many countries over the last number of years, we're finding that there's a very poor understanding of the value chain, particularly amongst the small growers. And I mean here, you know, knowledge of product specification, knowledge of quality. For instance, knowing the markets, knowing the supply demand forecast for products is so important. And we here, we preach this site species market approach, where it's not just planting trees, but it's getting the market intelligence before you plant the trees. And you can then apply the models that now exist, many growth and economic models to see if your returns are acceptable for a particular product. So much more business-like approach to planting, even for small, medium growers. Financing, SPGS obviously proves that conditional grants supporting small, medium growers can work. You might say it's unsustainable because the grant focus, but it's actually could be considered very cost effective from the government's point of view, given that it's attracted 50% of the input is coming from the private sector. So it's a cost effective way of a country getting a core plantation establishment, which is needed to support the economy. Concessional financing, particularly soft loans, have been, were considered right at the beginning, but the financial institutions didn't want to touch it. So eventually we decided to go on the grand route, down the grand route. And just interesting, those of you who might not know, there is a study underway in Kenya looking at a revolving tree fund for small, medium growers funded by DFID and the Nature Conservancy. So that's going to be interesting to follow. And you know, those of you who might not know, the problem obviously with forestry is that banks have lived experience quite often and they consider it high risk, particularly for the long term nature, even though we think the trees go very fast in the tropics. Right, conclusions, last slide. Soar load scheme has achieved good results on the ground, it's proved a sort of very strong PPP, public private partnership. It can work if it's carefully planned and well managed. And the sort of lessons from SPGS for others, I think, is it took this commercial approach, which is somewhat unusual for small, medium growers, but it certainly worked. And it focused on the best practices, best practices for growth and quality. So even for, you know, we preach in for communities, small growers, this is very important. We believe that the approach will have long term benefits for the sector, but only if there is more support on the value chains and market side. We're seeing this in many countries. And finally, the role of the Timber Growers Association are very important. I think we will discuss that a bit later. Right, thank you. That's me finishing, I think, in time. And there is an applause icon on the list of icons, I'm sorry, I see. Thank you. And if I may just go back to the original question. Key questions that we want to explore with you is how can they better support business incubation functions in a way that's sustainable and effective? We heard from all the speakers that the aggregation of those businesses is very important. And we just heard from Juan Carlos that the cooperatives that we work with were instrumental to make the model of CDS working really well. So how can SIP also provide support in organizing community, group-level income generating and analytical support activities taken to scale means to business incubation skills and the market players? So for example, as in the Ophelia's case, can SIP support some of the development of viable APEX-level organizations for small-scale producers? If so, how? And the last question, and many of the speakers also spoke to that, is about derisking. So how can SIP provide more support for derisking investment into small-scale producers so that those organizations can attract the finance? And we heard a good example of SIP live with the contract and the innovative way to monitor some of the activities really help derisking for the financial providers, but also help build up the credit and score for the small houses so that they can actually be able to access more finance standards. So all three questions are quite a link and I hope that you can also think about some of the following up questions for the speakers, but I know some of the audience here also have quite a lot of experience to share with those questions. So do feel free to use that question for speakers' box to make comments and share your experiences and thoughts on how SIP can tackle some of the three areas. And now if I can go back to some of the questions that are already on the screen. First, Mark, if I can just ask you to address the two of the questions. One is on the S3 system would also work with the conditionality based on forest restoration, not just climate, agriculture. That question is from Duncan. And the follow up question on that is that in that case, could the trees then be used as collateral to live your land in the event of people? And then there's another question from Achille about how were the farming practices affected and are they based in local practices or simply improved scientific practices? To link that question back to the financing section we're thinking about, Mark, can you probably elaborate a bit on how you can use the financing systems that you are developing on the S3 line to incentivize some of the farmers to adopt infection practices on their land that can be conducive for a sustainable business model or for a two-day-to-end plant? So I have to use you to answer that question. So I'll take those questions in order. So the question from Duncan. Yes, our system would work on the basis of forest restoration. I think, I guess there's always a question around what is forest restoration, but sort of skirting around that, just a sort of caveat, the limits to the F3 life system are that it's only suitable for farmers who are sufficiently sophisticated to take and repay commercial dust. And this wouldn't work with smallholder farmers who are conventionally unbankable in the jargon. And that's actually the majority of the smallholder farmers. So the F3 life system is only going to work within areas where farmers are considered credit worthy. To get around that problem, we've actually launched a sister business called GreenFi and you can look at the website for that, greenfi.org. And that allows NGOs or similar to place funds within a community managed revolving fund and the community to manage the loans themselves and for environmental condition to be placed on those loans. And then our system allows for a community managed monitoring system as well. And that is applicable to the larger number of smallholder farmers or small scale producers who are not conventionally bankable. So we've deployed these two different systems. The second GreenFiers in partnership, the two organisations, IUCN and PACS. the next on that which is part of, its no love for reference. Absolutely alone for any idea is only one of the ways in which the system can be used to adjust to small scale producer behaviour and age of the language of climate artists and agriculture, they're very much sort of there because funding opportunities are or were at the time. The question from Akile, how are the farming practices developed, local best practices or scientific practices? Well actually a little bit of both, we take the off-the-shelf practices and then through participatory discussions with farmer focus groups we adjust the requirements to suit what they're used to and capable of doing. And as an example, in Kenya the requirement was for grass contour strips in the first instance and then as loan sizes increased for the planting of trees to reinforce those grass strips. And the farmers themselves were allowed to choose both the grass type and the tree seeding according to what they knew best and wanted to use. We just got informed that Marcos unfortunately will need to leave us a bit early and we would probably before Marcos first ask a question about the recommendation for FIP on up-skilling investment with small-medium enterprises in Mexico. This question comes from Iselda and it's because Iselda knows that Akile is engaged in some of the activities in Mexico. Could you probably explore a little bit on that question, Juan Carlos? Yes, of course. We don't have right now currently an investment in Mexico and mainly because we didn't have a project developer we know for a long time and it seems like to be too risky for us. If there is a jurisdiction for FIP, then FIP would be interested to promote investment. We can for example agree into a co-financing initiative, FIP having a catalyzer role for us in terms of let's say first loss of co-financing under a grant base to the project which can reduce the cost and also de-risk a little bit our position. In that case investment decision will be faster. What I think is very important representing a fund is why a private fund, a specialized private fund can do a lot of things in short periods of time. Just an example, we deployed a hundred million euro or committed it in just four years which you know many many funds, institutional funds are not able to do. It's because we have a specialized team, we have boots on the ground and we can spend a lot of time on co-building the opportunities. So I think that FIP as a you know probably as a recommendation we could have a conversation or FIP could do it with other funds as well as the Moringa Fund for example. how to agree in a jurisdiction the impact both FIP and investors are looking at and then create an element at the top level that then will allow the fund manager to deploy the investment. I think it's very important to overcome sometimes you know these barriers of communication. In Peru we knocked the door of the FIP that has been managed by IDB at the moment. We couldn't coinvest in this project because I think the area of eligibility didn't match but of course we would be more than happy to collaborate with FIP. And this is what the risk in or co-financing initiative could be catalytic. May I just ask a follow-up question on this? When you mentioned that it's being considered too risky and it will be useful to consider healthy risks, could you just expand on what are some of the specific risks that you consider? You obviously mentioned that you want to rely on or trust in local partners and what are some of those risks that your investors would consider when we look at some of the financials or voice related and friendly? Yes of course. First we love the risk and this is what we are designed to. To be additional not to be like other financial institutions. This is our mission so we are really risk, not risk adverse but really we have a big appetite for risk. But we need to know how to manage that risk which is different to avoid risk. The way we manage the risk in terms of project implementation in Peru to be in Madrid de Dios, far away with a lot of trouble is through the project developer. Project developer, grassroots, well established, 30 year old, operations, very reputable. That's how we manage the risk of let's say performance of the project. The market risk in terms of the cacao, what happened if the cacao didn't work well and also what about the fluctuations or types of things related to that. We actually manage that risk through a hedge or let's say a coverage through a USA guarantee. The loan we provide for the cooperative, the operations of the project was under, actually was warrantied by USA through a 50% loss warranty by the Development Crate Authority of USA. So that supports a lot. If FIP can do things like that, it will be great for us to catalyze for example investment in Mexico. We couldn't make it for the first fund we had, but we can do it. So the question is not if there's a risky place. We go to risky places. You know the deforestations are in risky places, deep on the forest, different land use types. We just need to know how to manage it. The implementation risk you can manage quite well with a good project implementator. And then things related to market could be implemented through these market enhancement instruments, price warranties, off-takes, first loss as well. And I think we would be more than happy to do that with them. And so having said that, as Shia King said, I really need to run. But I was very happy to participate in this webinar. And please you have my contacts in the – which Shia King can share as well. And let's keep in touch. And thank you very much. Thank you so much, Juan Carlos. And please, the audience, feel free to send the Juan Carlos questions directly. Or you can keep in putting your comments and questions in the question chat box. And we can ask it on to Juan Carlos as well. And probably while we're on the deforesting topic, may I probably go to Paul now. And Paul, in your presentation you did talk about the importance in the Uganda page where you actually work with those smallholders in managing to reduce the risk and generate better returns. Could you please help elaborate a bit on some of the risks that you do see working with the people on the ground and how you manage to reduce them? And then we can go to some of the questions that other audience have posed for you. Thank you. We talked about risk. I listed ways of reducing the risks for small growers. I mean, they apply to all growers, but particularly for small growers. And what happened was they fell into two categories. One is the actual growth of the trees, the silviculture, which you see. This has just come up. Now, basically what we're saying is quite often growers, small, medium growers in particular, have poor growth and poor quality. But there are ways, as we've shown through SPGS, of improving that. So following the best practices, not just nominally, but making sure the staff, the extension staff are well trained. Contractors, if they're used, must also be trained in these practices. Sometimes you have to bring these in from outside, whether it's from Southern Africa or Brazil, the countries with the big plantation history. Secondly, fire protection is a big issue. Again, for small farmers in particular, your investment can disappear in an hour or so. Simple protection measures can be taken. As you get bigger, you have to certainly plan and invest in infrastructure, train the people and get some equipment. You can reduce these risks substantially. And the pests and diseases is becoming increasingly important in particular in exotic plantations. A lot of pests coming into Africa, into the eucalypts from Australia. We've got to keep abreast. So, you know, no need to panic. But good silviculture can reduce that risk by having, for instance, good weeding, reduce the stress in your crop. But longer term, it needs investment in research, particularly tree breeding. And this is really important. And then the second batch of risk is the markets and utilization of categorized them. And the fourth point there, you see a lot of small farmers have isolated small plantations, not realizing the implications of transporting their product to market. So it's very, really important. We realized within a year or two how important in the Soarlog scheme about the location of growers. And we stopped supporting people in isolated places and started this aggregation that everyone's talking about. That also brings about the fifth one, the lack of scale. When you have a few isolated growers, you have very weak negotiation powers. And in theory, the clustering can help you. But I have a sort of rider attached to the timber grower associations because what I'm seeing, particularly in East Africa, is, you know, some good and bad things really. Their expectations can be very high on these timber grower associations. Or they can be more like maybe the Uganda one is now developing into a more business-like approach. It tends to happen as if the donors fund these TGAs, the grower associations. They can sometimes, their expectations are far too high. So if you let it come from the growers themselves and support it, then they're much more likely to succeed. Number six, low value markets for trees. This is really to do with, as we said before, checking your market before you plant, getting the intelligence. I know a lot of things can happen between planting and harvesting in forestry. But still, you can reduce the risk by going to markets which look good. So, you know, 10, 15 years time, there will be a good market for transmission poles or saw logs, whatever. And the seventh point is inefficient processing is a big issue. Particularly, we see it in East Africa a lot. You get these little mills running around paying peanuts to some of the farmers. And the reason is they have very low recovery. So if you have this sort of equipment, you can't afford, and you're getting low recovery, you can't afford to pay the grower very much for his log. So this whole area of the sort of primary processing in particular certainly needs technical and possibly financial support. This area also has a question about the timber export restrictions and the small de-cresto market. It means that some of your growers can't get deep in the lock price. And is that something that the project could have foreseen? And if so, do you think it could have been addressed in tandem with the spending in the area? And if so, how? Right. A good question, Darius. And if you know the answer, please let me know. We are dumbfounded. It's a mystery why the prices in Uganda for saw logs are depressed. We've tracked the prices of them over the years and used to publish it every three months in the newsletter. And certainly at the moment, the last number of years, they haven't gone up. Anything like you would have expected from the demand projections. But it's so it really is. And I don't think the export restrictions is the answer. It is the reason. It is quite a strange phenomenon there. We don't know how much timber really is coming in, say from the Congo. But it is a strange. Really, I think it's the we sort of accept in SPGS that when we started, we didn't do this market intelligence enough. But I think we realized it after a few years and started to do that. And then a more general comment to this question, I think it highlights the importance of doing these sort of sector studies in a country. Looking at the main products, the supply and demand and the forecast in each country. We did one last year in Tanzania. And it really does show you surprising things sometimes with markets which farmers think they're going to grow. For instance, the transmission pole market in Kenya. Everybody's growing for this. And of course, you know, at some stage it's going to be saturated and it's going to be a lot of disappointed farmers who won't probably replant their crops. So these things, you know, you need these sort of fundamental studies, I think, to back up whatever project, whatever financial support is going to be given to the sector. Thanks. And Darius, feel free to comment, further comment in that question box. And I think the key, well, it will come back to focusing on some of the really key questions we posed about SPGS. And I think the key has used for a way to one of the common issues that I think the public, all the speakers, including some of the speakers, respond to speak to, is about the barrier for small producers. One of them is obviously the collateral, as some of the speakers spoke to. And I guess the monitoring of some of the more holist activities by financial institutions. So in your view or your understanding of these activities and your experiences, how can this issue be resolved? So should I probably hand over to Tom for a brief start to that first? Yeah, I agree. I think there's a really interesting discussion around this. Certainly in Ghana, we had some useful discussion with small and medium tree growers who were very keen to get engaged in producing trees. There was land available, but they lacked two key things. One was effective technical support, which Paul has talked about very clearly. And the second thing was financing. The two things were just not available. It was effectively people financing it from their own savings, from families borrowing from within their family. But they were unable to go to formal financial institutions and leverage financing because banks just weren't ready to look at small scale timber production. It was too risky. It was too long term. Questions of land tenure, uncertainties, fire risk as well. It just was impossible for people to get started. Now, I'm aware that in Ghana, the FIT program is very aware of this and the discussions with the national ministry. They are exploring opportunities through additional financing to see how some support could be provided. But I'm not entirely sure how far that discussion has come. So I think that's that's actually key. If I may, I might also just add, I think there's some really interesting discussion as well about the degree to which, you know, there's two very contrasting models here. One where you really adopt the value chain approach, the kind of model that we saw certainly in Uganda, actually in all the speakers, where there's a very well defined subsector or value chain that's being supported, which is well known. The barriers, the incentives around that are well researched and support is provided around that. And then there's this more open ended community bottom up type income generating activities and support and financing to that that we've seen in a number of the projects. And obviously both have strengths and weaknesses, but I think, you know, perhaps one of the challenges with the with the highly participatory bottom up community identified initiatives is that you effectively have a huge number of value chains, which start to emerge. It could be small scale livestock, could be agriculture, could be tree planting, a whole range of things. So any any particular project's ability to provide the needed technical support around that wealth of emerging income generating areas is extremely difficult. So I think there's a really important trade off there about the degree to which projects support specific value chains and sectors and effectively say that this is what we're going to do. This is where we have expertise and this is where we can support you and those that adopt this more bottom up community driven approaches, which which which which have a huge number of strengths and also provide a huge, you know, opportunities to building goodwill and so on. But but maybe less focused in terms of business innovation and market support. Great. So for the rest of the speakers now, could you if you can address two questions now. One is about how can SIP help with that lateral challenge that smallholders face. And then at the same time, the very interesting question Tom has also posed about how do you manage that balance and a trade off between the well defined subsectors, the value chain approach and the bottom up engagement approach with the community. And again, all the audience, please feel free to comment and share your experiences in the chat box as well. Paul, Paul, maybe can you start and we can contact Mark the question. Okay, Mike, well, looking at or listening to Tom's questions a little bit. I think for me, the thing is you've heard about the background to the Soorlog scheme in Uganda. Of course, it's not the model that you talk about and the model for the other projects. It's very, they're very sometimes a very country specific. And I think from what I'm seeing, there's some basic information you need on land, the situation in the forest sector, the agricultural sector. And you apply these to a particular country. And I think this is what we're finding that you can take lessons learned. I think this is really important. The lessons are starting to come out now across the board of things that work. And yet still many projects start and fail for the same reasons they have for many years. So I sound very cynical. Tom, maybe if you're still online, can you sort of address or let me know what you'd like my input on beyond that? I think one of the really interesting things that you've touched on, Paul, is this whole question of the Tree Growers Association, the APEX organization. This is something that's really come out in actually quite a number of the discussions and the presentations that have come through that. And I noticed Duncan has put a question into the mix here about support to Tree Growers Associations in terms of providing ongoing market intelligence and business advice. And as well as this sort of broad question of incubation services to growers. So I suppose, you know, it's a question about. You touched on it in your presentation, I think a little bit about the degree to which we can. We shouldn't put too much into these organizations. We should let them develop their own support and define their own objectives. But I suppose, you know, it'd be interesting to know what do you think will be the long term objective of the Tree Growers Association? What sorts of services do you think, well, do they currently provide and what could they provide in the future? Yes, one that I frequently turn to as a vision is the South African one, Forestry South Africa, which is a growers organization that represents growers from the huge companies, Mondi and Sapi, right down to small growers. Now, you look at what they do. They're involved in forest policy, very strong lobbying, government on land issues, whatever support to the sector. They organize training, committees that decide training and even research, fund research. Of course, they give advice to growers. Now, to get to that level, of course, takes many years. It's a very mature commercial forest sector in South Africa. So rather different, I think, to what we're seeing in certainly in East Africa and West Africa. But it's a vision. And I think it's always important to have a vision. If you look at my Uganda example, it was always the we were always asked, of course, by the donors, what's the what's the plan for the future, the exit strategy for SPGS? And of course, the sustainability of it was to build capacity in the Uganda Timber Growers Association. I think sort of looking back, that's really not happening quick enough. And again, it comes back, there's a reluctance, I think, to let go. And, you know, SPGS seen as a successful project and seems to be reluctant to let go to build up the capacity of this private organization. I think it really should happen if they want it to stand on its feet. So and then what I see, you know, elsewhere where you force TGA's, Timber Grower Associations, we really do just raise expectations too much sometimes, I think. You know, it's not easy making a profit on low quality timber and it needs to be said, I think, to growers. But, you know, we've got to do what we can to make it profitable for growers if they've got the right quality and the system and building up some of these value chains. Thanks. And now we can probably move on to Mark and Duncan. I think in response to Tom's question, Paul also partly addressed some part of your question in terms of how they can fund some of the tree doors of association. If you have any follow up of specific questions, please do put it into the chat box. And now we move on to Mark to address some of the two questions. Mark to address some of the questions. So your first question, Zauteng, is how can FIP contribute to resolve the issue of absence of collateral among small scale producers? Well, I think it kind of needs to sort of look over the fence at what's happening in the, I guess, sort of the smallholder credit financing world, where there seems to have been a lot of innovation over the last sort of four or five years, particularly in the direction of sort of unsecured credit through value chain financing, through USSE lending, through the creation of credit reference bureaus, through the improvements made in the credit scoring of low income borrowers. I think what the FIPP will have to do is start to sort of collaborate more closely with that world. It's almost as though they operate in two different silos, but actually they're often talking about the same things and the same problems. The second question is how to manage the trade-offs between a value chain approach of financing and community-based bottom-up approaches. I actually sort of wonder whether the two are mutually exclusive. The sometimes sort of concerning reality is that small scale producers live their lives in debt. And actually, from what we see from our research, have many obligations to many, many different sort of lenders, both formal and formal. They owe the bank something, they owe their family something, they owe the local loan shark something. They're only ever sort of underwater to more or less an extent over time. And so within that reality, I think you can actually have two approaches to financing. One is through the sort of the value chain and through the sort of, I guess, the commercialization of certain of their growing activities. And then others, you know, that doesn't sort of preclude any more community-oriented financing schemes, such as that provided by GreenFi and IECM and Acuras and Rwanda are doing something similar as well. So I think that would be the answer to that. I think we're running out of time now. So the last round, I'll just let everyone have a final remark. And especially if you feel like you have any specific last words that goes towards that three, three questions that are presented on the slide. And again, the audience, please feel free also to put some of your feedback on thinking all the three questions in the chat box. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes. To thank the presenters for sharing this interesting experience, and it, for me, was instructing to learn of the different initiatives and efforts that are being made to support the smallholders. But just a general comment, I know we don't have too much time to have a discussion. This initiative is about breaking or looking at how to overcome barriers to financing SMEs. And in our framework of analysis includes looking at what are the investments in enabling, creating enabling conditions like capacity building, et cetera, that you have talked about, both in terms of the technical capacity, securing tenure, and also enabling them to act as finance for active investments. And it does distract me, and I would like to have a further discussion as we go along with this study, on how do we use this notion of supporting sophisticated producers, because they are credit-worthy, to bring other smallholders, and by using these sophisticated producers perhaps as the lead producers that can bring the relatively smaller ones who can be managing revolving funds, or other means of producing that could increase not only the scale of getting the finance, but perhaps addressing the objectives that the city is pursuing. I know that those initiatives were started with different contexts and objectives, but we want to have lessons to see how synergies and leveraging of financing can be brought in by collaboration between these different initiatives with FIB. I think also it's worth reflecting going forward on the issue of aggregation and clustering, and what I'm hearing is working with APEX organizations. It's good, but also not so good because of the unreasonable demands. But I think perhaps there has to be an investment on the negotiation, because the smallholders with one actor each, they often, because they lack the knowledge on markets, and even on the agricultural aspects in the case of plantations, but also lack knowledge on processing other products that they can harvest from natural forests, they really need to work in some sort of grouping and to have institutions that can strengthen their voice. So how do we address the challenges that can come for organization and perhaps strong views on certain aspects to making sure that the negotiation is in place that can allow a win-win situation in terms of channeling financing, but also getting the results in terms of putting good products of quality to market at a price that is acceptable to all institutions that are engaged? And I think maybe I'll stop here just because of time, but I think we should pursue further discussion and also understanding how the no-risk-averse institutions like Auteria are operating and working with cooperatives, and how these can be the lessons from these initiatives can inform the potential partnerships between financing to private sector by FIB with those ongoing initiatives. So I thought I should just make that general comments, not expecting an answer now, but something that we should pursue with you and the others to at least work goes along. Thank you so much for highlighting all those schemes and negotiation, the importance of negotiation for Pashqis and all the other key issues that are reminding us that this webinar is not really the end of the discussion, the limit. So, if you are only starting to explore a number of questions with you. So if you don't really want to directly respond to that three questions, if you have some further thoughts on some of the key issues that you think that the lending and evaluation leadership should investigate further, focusing on some of the, obviously, six and six roles in financing for policy related enterprises, please also feel free to share and keep your intervention short. And then I will go to Tom and Paul and Mark. Yeah, thanks, Shouching. I really don't want to use up more time other than to say I think this has been an excellent set of presentations. And for me, it's really highlighted the need to balance these two extremely complex areas of investment. One, this financial tailoring the financial packages to meet the specific requirements of the end users in ways that is usable and friendly and appropriate. But secondly, this is enabling instead of enabling investments, that's very clearly as well. Whether it's the extension support in the case of the working Uganda or market assistance as well, linking people to markets and providing all these enabling investments, of course, also including broader regulatory and policy aspects, getting that mix in a way that provides, opens up opportunities for private sector activities, clearly a complex task and getting that mix right. For me is a really critical aspect. So I'll leave it there and see if others have any final wrap up comments. Paul, we'll move to you for some of the final thoughts. Thank you. I think it's been valuable, some interesting lessons coming in and particularly, you know, this interface between agriculture and forestry now as well, which is going to be more important. And particularly as we all know, this small growers, small tree growers are going to be the future supply, particularly in Africa, given the land situation. So I think we really need to maybe do a little bit more of this lessons learned from these and share them. It's quite one of the issues, of course, is that people don't like to publish bad results, let's say, you know, but there are times where it's really good to lessons learned, positive and bad and negative. So we can drive these initiatives forward. And I think particularly that we need to think more carefully on these timber grower associations, because I see, you know, approaches that are not working in East Africa and some that are working. And a lot of a lot of different people competing for this as well, which is crazy. So I think, you know, the more that we can sort of address this issue, the better it will be for the small farmers. Just to say, yeah, thank you very much. And maybe just conclude by saying I saw there was a big conservation finance conference in New York, I think, hosted by Credit Suisse. A couple of weeks ago. One of the conclusions of that was the importance of replicability and scalability. Now, on scalability, that's fine. On replicability, there's a big question about, you know, how replicable investments at local level in the difference of agroecological and cultural contexts are. And so searching for these replicable business models is going to be sort of vital. And that's what sort of has to look for and the tools that can de-risk those, I think, few but possible replicable investment models. Thank you all for being here. And thanks to all the speakers. They spent quite a lot of time preparing the presentation to ensure that we can maximize our learning. And again, this is not really the end of this learning journey. We will send you the presentation, not including our seniors, and then the audio recording of this by the end of this week or early next week. And then that would include the contact information for all the speakers for all the speakers for you to follow up. And if you have any further comments or thoughts about this webinar, please also feel free to contact us as well. And with that, I'll just close the webinar. And thank you.
