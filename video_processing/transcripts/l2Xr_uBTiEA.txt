 If you ever look at this cut over here, it is 45 degrees to the angle of the branch. What that means is the auxins and the hormones are being centered around this corner over here, which is the tip. And just below the tip is a bud. That's the bud I want to stimulate to grow. And this brings me into the angles and the bud locations. There's a bud on the very top over here. Now if I were to cut here, this bud is going to go straight up. So if you cut it at the wrong location, you've got this nice 45 degree angled branch, which you are now sending into a vertical. You've just lost a whole bunch of good work. But if you cut it on the bottom outward facing node, this branch is now going to grow that way. It's not going to grow inwards and up. It's going to grow outwards and up.
