 Let's harvest some aeroponic orange cherry tomatoes from this tower garden. Wow, look at that incredible color. These aeroponic tomatoes were grown without the use of soil. What that means is that we use a method of farming called aeroponics. We use only water mixed with an ionic mineral nutrient solution to grow these tomatoes. This mineral nutrient solution provides all the essential minerals and trace elements that plants need for healthy plant growth.
