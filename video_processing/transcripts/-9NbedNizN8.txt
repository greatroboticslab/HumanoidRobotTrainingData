 Good morning modernsteaders. It's a beautiful morning this morning. Today it's supposed to be like 90 for us. It's like pretty warm for this part of the country. I got all the other animal chores done. The pigs have fed, the chickens have fed. I hear the goats. Now it's time to let them out. See how they did for their first night and try our hand at. Okay, let's see how this goes. Two girls survive your first night. Looks like you did. Aww. Huh? You hear the pigs? Looks like you got straw all over you, Blossom. You ready, Willow? Okay. Willow. Willow. Just One. Uh. happen now. See? That weren't so bad, was it? You guys cleaning up after mom? Right, Willow? That wasn't bad, Willow. Willow is a first time milker and so am I. So that was pretty good. Yeah, we're gonna get better. Alright, what did I just learn from my first milking experience? First of all, the tiniest milking pill I could find is way too tall for our Nigerian dwarf goats. So I'm gonna have to order probably a shallower but wider bucket. I'll see if I can find something on Amazon. I'll start using that. Um, Willow is gonna be an awesome milker. We both just need to get used to it. But I am excited. It's gonna be a fun learning curve. I think it was good this morning. Oh, what's the matter? You like your sausage egg McMuffins now? Yeah. Yeah. Don't say that. I'm sure I'm on it. You got a red cheek today. So much fun with the goat yesterday. Somebody's gonna say goat goat? Go home. You gonna sit, Poodle? Poodle, sit. Go. Ready? You pooped everywhere. I know. I'm telling you that they pooped on my feet. That's what they do. They poop. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Did you sleep good? Did you sleep good? Did you sleep good? Did you sleep good? Did you sleep good? Did you sleep good? Blossom was covered in straw, so they must have slept pretty good. Trying to get out? Yeah, you want to come see me? Like 100 in my feet. Yeah, they trip you up pretty good. Well, then they look at me like, why did you just do that? I didn't do anything on purpose. I think your goats want ya. Oh. What are you doing? Hey. You're giving one on my ear. You're giving one on my ear. You're giving one on my ear. You're giving one on my ear. Crazy. You named them and you're giving them the wrong name. You're calling them the wrong name. You came up with names. Did you say button? You said button. You said button and I did not say button. You named them and you called them the wrong name. You came up with names. Did you say button? You said button. I did not say button. Yes, come here, button. Awesome. Oh, my goodness. You said button. I did not. You did, too. Let's see if the pigs come out today. You're going to come out there, Lynx. You're scared. Oh, my God. Merit You girls like that. I've been waiting to prune those trees until you get here. At least that way we can do something with them. Well you made it out, you didn't get too far though. Was she in the house? The goats are blotting so much more today, huh Livy's? Watch out! Whatcha doin' Blossom? You comin' to say hi? Blossom's triggered it all out. Look at her. She can eat some hay and she can also eat some apple tree leaves. She can, can't she? Yep. Look at her back up. She's just enjoying the leaves. She's just enjoying the leaves. Oh. She's just enjoying the leaves. She's enjoying the leaves. She's enjoying the leaves. I don't know. I don't know. But she's enjoying the leaves. Oh. She's enjoying the hello. I want to know. I want to know my partner. Do you girls like raisins? I don't. Me neither. You don't. But your goat does. Do you girls like raisins? I don't. Me neither. You don't? But your goat does. That's good. Get out. I got it. Hey, awesome. You have to share. Ow, don't do that. What are you doing? Do you want some raisins? OK, guys. Hey, hey. I want raisins. So we want raisins. OK, she's chewing her cud. She's going to swallow it in a minute. Oh, she swallowed. No, she didn't. Oh, well, it looked like she did. She's going to swallow it in a minute. We started doing it. OK, she swallowed. She's going to have some stuff come up in a second and get chipmunk cheeks. Here it comes. There she goes. She shut her eyes that time. She's like, oh, this is not a big chunk. No, did you see it? It almost like pulled out of her neck. It had to look that big. She's like, what you guys? That's not nice. She's going to laugh at me like that. Chewing your cud. OK, it's going to be gone in a minute. She's going to swallow it. No, a little bit more left. Do you like people watching you eat? Oh, she swallowed. No, she still got some. No. What did it take you so long? There's a big mouthful. Ouch. Hey, don't be doing that while you're doing your cud. I can't watch you do it in there. She's going to get some in there. Here, yep, here it. And then a big mouthful. Do you think that's funny? The freeway. What's that? I said it's the freeway. It's the freeway. Carrots are, hmm. The beets aren't doing too bad. Oh, it's the freeway. It's the freeway. Carrots are, hmm. Carrots are, hmm. The beets aren't doing too bad. The tomato plants look awesome. It's a red strawberry. What's that? It's a red strawberry. Can I eat it? Is it red, red? Nope. It's red, red. It's not red, red. It's pink. That's the one that was turning it. There's one over here that's red, red. Okay, first strawberry. Can I wash it again? Yes. Yeah. Put it in the bucket. Does it taste like butter? Yummy. Is it sweet? Is it tart? It's sweet. Sweet. Are you full of it? How's it looking? Good. There it is. It's right here. Yeah, it's big. It's doing good. I see two or three tomatoes over on this one. One, two, and I think I saw another one, but I can't find it now. Oh, three right here. Awesome. And the squashes and cucumbers or vice versa are doing good over here. These ones we started from seed. And these ones we started in the outdoor kitchen and soil blocks. They're doing awesome. And the potatoes are looking good. Oh. I'm excited for the cabbage. It seems to be doing pretty good. Red cabbage and then the green cabbage is on this side. And I'm not seeing any green cabbage. Hmm. I wonder how long it'll be before we start picking some string beans. Sup? You're crazy pigs. You really still haven't gone out yet, have ya? Yeah. You chewed up the ramp I made with wood chips. Don't you touch it. I think the chicken got zapped. It's time to try milking again. You want to hand me a wipe? This one? Yep. Wipe the udder down. Wipe your feet down. Get your clean feet. Wipe the udder. Alright. Now let's try milking. You hear it? Mm hm. Do you hear it? Mm-hmm. Do you do that at both seats? I do one second at a time. Oh, okay. Here, Billy. So Willow did really good milking. We got a good, probably a small cup load. She's not used to getting milked and I'm not used to milking. So, and they're new here, so I don't know if it's right, but I'm trying to ease her into it, without getting her too upset and the kid's upset. That's my thoughts. If you have goat experience, let me know what you think of that idea. Leave it in the comments down below. You like your goats? Yeah. You wanna return them? No. No, you wanna keep them? Yeah. Okay. Thanks for coming along on our crazy journey with us. Today, and we'll see you right back here tomorrow at London Acres, a guide to modern homesteading so see you in freedom. Bye. Bye.
