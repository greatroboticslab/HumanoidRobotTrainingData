 hello everyone welcome to episode 43 of dollar dialogue podcast today's episode is a very interesting episode as today we are going to be talking about big brothers and their economies which is a fan favorite so for today's big brothers we have paul pot of cambodia mobutu sese siko of zair and islam karimov of uzbekistan whose economic decisions has left a profound mark on their nations and while their political regimes are clearly marked by severe repression and human right abuses their economic policies has undeniably played a pivotal role in shaping uh the fate of their countries and each one of these leaders whether you like them or not has employed distinct economic strategies but all were driven by the desire to maintain control over their nations through economic manipulation leading to long-term consequences which has uh rippled through their societies still today so with that being said today for our guest speaker we have a very special guest speaker mr chanju kim i've known mr chanju kim uh since uh since since the past year and he's an excellent student he is currently the he currently has the highest gpa in his class and he's also the youngest nhs member in our school so academically chanju is very gifted but what he's more gifted is in the realm of politics and economics chanju is amazing at geography you can probably like point any country in the map and he'll tell you the capital and obviously he also knows a lot about the historical figures which is why uh chanju uh is currently uh like willing to pursue history next year and he is also willing to pursue economics because uh he uh because before our podcast what he was actually talking to me about the chee bowls in south korea and how they sort of have a monopoly over everything so clearly he's very gifted academically he's very gifted financially as well and also very athletic he's very good at football so we're very uh happy to have mr chanju kim uh in the podcast today mr chanju kim would you like to add anything to the introduction that i've just stated um yes yeah firstly thank you very much for the wonderful um introduction and it is really a big uh honor for me to be part of this wonderful podcast discussion with amazing hosts of dollar dialogue yeah thank you again thank you mr chanju kim uh for the introduction so yeah uh guys let's get uh right into it so for today uh we have the three big brothers uh firstly we'll go uh we'll go in a chronological order first we'll start with paul pot then we'll go into mobuto uh sese sekho and islam karimov so first i would like to talk a give a give the audience a bit uh in a bit of an introduction about paul pot who was the famous leader of the khmer rouge regime in cambodia and basically to give uh uh some introduction about paul pot uh uh from an economic uh standpoint as well as from a political uh standpoint i would like to first mention uh about the genocide that happened uh during his regime uh which saw the dismantling and the violent killings of the nation's uh previous economic and social structure and this is probably one of the worst genocides uh that has happened in southeast asia's history and clearly paul pot was a very bad leader in terms of the fact that he killed like around two million cambodians but firstly i would like to talk about uh his economic policies uh in cambodia under the khmer rouge regime which was uh i believe from 1975 to 1979 if i'm not mistaken and it was very disastrously misguided and led to the collapse of the country's economy and from an economic standpoint the policies implemented during this period not only devastated the nation's infrastructure but also resulted in catastrophic losses in terms of productivity human lives and long-term economic stability so firstly i would like to talk about the agricultural output collapse so paul pot's radical attempt to like transform cambodia into a rural self-sufficient agrarian society led to the abandonment of urban areas and forced uh relocation of approximately two million people into the countryside and these individuals many of whom were urban professionals with no agricultural experience and they were sort of coerced into working on agricultural uh collective farms and the immediate consequences of this ship of the shift was a sharp decline in agricultural productivity and despite the khmer rouge's goal of increasing rice production output plummeted and starvation became widespread so by 1979 cambodia's right rice production had fallen by 50 to 70 percent compared to the pre-regime levels and not only that it also led to economic isolation under paul pot cambodia was sort of cut off from the global economy the khmer rouge sort of abolished currency they banned private enterprise which effectively severed the country from both international trade and its own internal market foreign aid which many of you might be aware of for example the u.s foreign aid which had previously been a critical part of cambodia's economy were also suspended so with the collapse of trade and industry obviously the economy shrank dramatically and the gdp in 1979 uh when the regime ended as i was researching was at least 75 percent lower than when it had been before the khmer ruse took over so clearly the economic consequences of this was beyond disastrous for uh cambodia other than that i would also like to talk about the human cost of economic policies the economic policies under paul pot directly contributed to the massive loss of life starvation uh forced labor and air and executions were rampant in during this period it is estimated that 1.5 to 2 million cambodians uh which is basically effectively 25 percent of the population died from malnutrition overwork or execution during the khmer ruse regime so i remember uh in grade eight under mr ronoso we had a in during a social studies class we were talking about the fact that all the smart people uh in during the khmer ruse regime for example if you wear glasses or spectacles and if the if the representative of the khmer ruse regime if they saw you uh in public they would kill you just for wearing glasses because people who wore glasses were traditionally considered to be like smart and well-read because they because uh they wore glasses uh so this perception of people wearing glasses sort of had them killed so basically if i were if i were in cambodia at this point in time during the khmer ruse i would be killed as well so that's how paul pot's regime was he was absolutely a mad dictator with no clear economic incentive to move cambodia forward and he clearly had a very uh sort of close-minded view of how an economy should be run so additionally after uh after the as i was mentioning the currency abolishing and price controls uh uh which were sort of unrealistic and unmanageable and this led to famine and starvation so as a result of the drastic changes to the agricultural sector combined with the forced collectivization and environmental factors cambodia experienced severe food shortages so around three million people had died due to famine malnutrition and disease and these were clearly uh the consequences of paul pot's economic policies which had decimated agricultural production and uh sort of disrupted the food distribution so after the fall of paul pot's regime in 1979 cambodia faced a long and difficult path to economic uh recovery the economy was essentially left in ruins with the agriculture and industrial sector virtually non-existent and it took decades before cambodia's gdp could show any meaningful growth again and the nation's reliance on foreign aid was critical for construction efforts but the long-lasting effects of paul pot's economic policy sort of kept cambodia among the world's poorest uh nations for many years after the regime so clearly paul pot's radical vision uh sort of ignored the realities of agriculture industry and trade and the first sort of collectivization economic isolation and the destruction of agriculture and mass purges not only decimated the cambodian population but also like devastated the country's economy and the long-term effects of these uh economic policies can still be felt today as cambodia like continues to rebuild from the economic devastation uh caused by the khmer rus regime so uh with that being said uh uh would anyone like anyone else like to add uh anything to the brief introduction that that had stated about paul pot uh mr shazib kareem mr so pete nagala or mr chanju kim thank you so much arab malik for such a detailed though short and concise it's a very detailed and mind-boggling introduction to this dictator so when we talk about genocides and atrocities we often frame them as the acts of isolated madmen like monsters working alone but history is really that simple and paul pot he wasn't acting in a vacuum his rise and reign of terror were enabled not just by his ideology not just by his followers but by powerful nations who either looked the other way or actively helped him let's talk about china first maoist china was paul pot's uh paul pot's ideological muse and his biggest backer the kmer rouge shared china's revolutionary zeal radical agrarian socialism and anti-intellectualism at the rejection of western influence and beijing loved it they poured in funding weapons and military training we're talking billions of dollars in support throughout the 1970s and even after vietnam invaded cambodia in 1979 and exposed the full horror of the killing fields china continued to support a kmer rouge both militarily and diplomatically because now it was about geopolitics geopolitics uh vietnam had soviet backing so china popped propped up poor port to oppose the soviets and human rights well they were all gone but here's where the curveball comes in the west especially the united states they also played a part not because they supported paul pot's ideology hell no but because they hated the vietnamese occupation of cambodia even more during the cold war it was all about the enemy of my enemy so even after the world knew about the kmer rouge and what they had done the u.s and its allies refused to recognize the new vietnamese back cambodian government instead they allowed kmer rouge representatives to keep cambodia seat at the united nations until 1993. let that sink in so on paper the u.s was condemning genocide but in practice their actions helped legitimize the same regime that murdered nearly two million people so here's what i want to ask you guys and true to you guys what's worse supporting a genocidal regime because you share its ideology like china or supporting supporting it purely for political convenience like the west and does that moral calculus actually matter to the people who end up suffering in the end wow subred i'd like to applaud you for your insightful information and yeah you also asked a really good question but um and i would really like to answer the question but before um before answering your question i'd just like to give a like uh brief insights from my own perspective as well so if you look at uh pol pot like so let me paint your picture like the moment pol pot's forces seized um uh phnom pen like cambodian's capital he ordered the entire population to evacuate yes the entire city so imagine millions forced into the countryside at gunpoint why because pol pot believed that cities were symbols of capitalist decay and his dream was a classless self-sufficient aggregate society and um this sounds romantic on paper to some radicals but in practice it was pure hell banks were abolished the currency was useless private property was uh forbidden and markets were non-existent the entire economy was replaced by forced agricultural labor you were assigned to a collective farm didn't matter if you were a doctor teacher or child if you couldn't produce rice or build irrigation candles you were a burden and often a target poppot's regime relied on fear violence and total economic control there was no room for innovation creator entrepreneurship in fact even speaking of foreign language could get you executed between starvation overwork and mass executions nearly two million cambodians died roughly a quarter of the entire population so now like answering your question supriy i think like that's that's a heavy but very important question and you know it's we could like really debate it you know supriy but i think this usually uh like supporting genocide uh directly like you had mentioned supriy i think like this usually comes from a place of ideological belief a war convinced conviction that certain groups are a threat inferior or undeserving of existence and this is horrifying because it reveals how far humans can go in service of an idea no matter how evil because for example polpot's belief that intellectuals and urban elites had to be eradicated to build an agrian utopia like are you had previously mentioned and you know this was very extreme but it was rooted in belief and you know still results in massive human suffering and um i think like you know supporting genocide for political convene convenience as super you'd ask this means that you know it's wrong but you do it or tolerate it because it's useful and it's about maintaining alliances gaining resources silencing dissent or staying in power and you know um for example governments that have backed regimes committing atrocities because they were strategic partners are useful against communism or terrorism and you know um like here you're like creating human lives for short-term power or like or comfort and pretending that it's okay and i think both of them are like very evil and wrong but like you know i don't know what to say like in many ways like supporting genocide out of belief is just a radical evil and supporting genocide out of convenience is calculated evil and in many ways the second can be more chilling because it it because it emits awareness and still chooses silence or complicity and you know i was reading this book and as philosopher hannah arendt once wrote it's not just the monsters we should fear it's the bureaucrats of evil who nod stamp papers and enable atrocities from a desk and then we should be able to ask thank you so much uh shazae for such a interesting answer to my question and chanju what do you have to say definitely give your thoughts as well and if possible please answer my question as well thank you um okay so before i answer to surprise question um since um i think there was lots of conversations about um genocide um which is also called as killing fields one of the um most cruel genocide in the human history um i would like to talk about like pol pot's other policies and its impact on um cambodia's uh economic economy so uh firstly um pop up and uh um kamara rouge viewed uh capitalism and industry as a corrupt and explorative um leading them into um dismantle all economic structures related to trade finance and manufacturing so one of the camera rouge's first act was to eliminate um cambodia's currency which was the real at the time and as a consequence banks were shut down and their reserves were looted or destroyed and people had no means of saving or exchanging value making economic transactions impossible also all forms of private businesses from small shop to large enterprises were banned and markets including food markets were dismantled and which forced people to depend on government controlled relations trade with other countries was also almost entirely cut off which could mean that cambodia was isolated and it was yeah cambodia was by itself yeah so factories were closed as a industrial production was seen as a part of corrupt um bargeous economy machinery and industrial equipment were left to rust or were repurposed for military use um and skilled worker and professionals were executed as you said um due to killing fields and sent to labor camps and further um crippling productivity the economy so i think the economic consequences of this destruction of industries were without the trader industry cambodia had technically no functioning economy so the lack of currency made it impossible for people to obtain goods outside of this uh state-controlled system and the country lost its ability to import their like its essential goods including like medicines and uh machineries so yeah that's all for it thank you chandu for your insights and um you know i also had another question on polpot and like this entire situation because it's like quite intriguing if you look at it so my question is like why do you guys think like why did the global community respond so slowly or not at all to polpot's genocide so all who proceed to the water i say is that you're expressing a issue that thee we are extracting dr and the world's habit of reacting to genocide only when it's too late. So let's break it down. The Khmer Rouge took power in 1975, as Ari have already explained, and by 1977 to 1978, mass atrocities were committed. But very few nations intervened. Why? Because this wasn't just a humanitarian issue. It was wrapped in the Cold War. For instance, Vietnam, backed by the Soviet Union, was the first to intervene. They invaded Cambodia in 1979, ousted Pol Pot, and installed a new government. But the West, especially the US and the Allies, they didn't want to support anything Vietnam was doing. So instead of supporting the effort to remove such a genocidal regime, they kept viewing it through a Cold War lens. And even after the genocide was widely known, the West and China continued to support the remnants of the Khmer Rouge, as I already explained before. And the UN, they themselves let Pol Pot's representatives hold Cambodia's seat, even after all of the mass executions, forced labor, and the thousands of people who died due to hunger. So let that sink in. The man who orchestrated one of the worst genocides of the 28th century was still represented diplomatically, while survivors were literally starving in refugee camps. And let's be real, Cambodia is, and not anymore, but was a small and quite a poor Southeast Asian country. It didn't have oil, it didn't have nukes, and it wasn't seen as a strategic priority unless it was tied to bigger powers. So that's why the world dragged its feet. We saw the same with Rwanda as well. We see it again and again every day. The international community is quick to say never again, but way too slow to say enough. So in essence, politics. Politics is the main reason as to why the global community responded so slowly and so carelessly to Paul post genocide. Thank you for answering my questions. That was really insightful. So yeah, Ari, I'll hand it over to you unless anyone else wants to answer my questions. So yeah, Ari. Yeah, everyone, thank you for the insight. So yeah, I think Shalzeh was a very good question. Geopolitics is obviously a very important issue in our times. And obviously, we don't want to get too political here. And like Dollar Dialogue does not endorse any particular regime. So, but we do think that as a collectively, I think everyone can agree that the Pol Pot regime was clearly marked by terror. And whether or not United States intervened, that's based on their political standpoint. And like at that point in time, clearly the Cold War was going on. So even for example, in 1971, the United States particularly did not help Bangladesh that much, even though we had like a sort of a genocide as well. And that's because of the political tensions during that time. So Cold War was, I think, a bigger issue. That's a topic for another day. So I think the discussions about Pol Pot was very significant, I think. And so do we guys unanimously agree that, or like do you guys agree that Pol Pot's regime for Cambodia was marked by terror? And from an economic standpoint, it left Cambodia in a state of isolation and also like disrupted the economy, which consequences can still be felt in the Cambodian economy today as it's still a very poor country. Most definitely. I do agree with you, Ari, but I also believe it's very important to also look at it through a humanitarian standpoint as well and underscore the significance of Pol Pot's genocidal regime. Yes, thank you for the agreement. So, yeah. So moving on, I would like to now talk about Mobutu Sese Seko, who was the authoritarian leader of Zaire. But Zaire is currently known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And Seko was the leader of Zaire from 1965 to 1997. And his reign was marked by economic mismanagement, rampant corruption, and an enduring legacy of poverty and instability in the country. And Mobutu is often cited as one of Africa's most notorious kleptocrats, having used the state's resources for personal gain while exploiting Zaire's vast mineral wealth. So, and kleptocrats are basically, like the dictionary definition of it is, like a ruler who uses their power to steal a country's resources. So Mobutu was clearly a very notorious kleptocrat. And some of the points regarding Mobutu Sese Seko's economic policy that I found through extensive research was the fact that Zaire, Zaire, Narism, and economic nationalism was one of the facts. So one of Mobutu's earliest economic policies, which was initiated in the 1970s, is called Zairenization. And this policy aimed to transfer the ownership of foreign-owned businesses, especially in key sectors like mining and trade, to Zairean citizens. And while the policy was sort of framed as a way to promote national pride and economic independence, it was largely ineffective and often disasters. And Mobutu and his allies seized foreign businesses and handed them over to politically connected Zaireans who lacked expertise to run them effectively. And the same thing sort of happened in Uganda because there's a large diaspora of Indians who were living in Uganda. But after Idi Amin sort of took over Uganda, he sort of expelled the Indians who were sort of living there for second and third generations there. And he handed the businesses to the local Ugandans. But the problem was the local Ugandans had no sort of idea on how to run businesses, how to do accounting, bookkeeping, all those stuff. So clearly the incompetence sort of led to the negative impact of Ugandan economy. And the same can be said about Zaire as well because Mobutu's policy of Zaireanization sort of was lacking and was not well planned out because the people were not sort of experienced. And this sort of incompetence led to economic stagnation as formerly profitable industries like minerals collapsed under mismanagement. And for example, the mining sector, which was a critical part of the Zairean economy, experienced significant declines in productivity. And obviously with that economic stagnation, it comes as no surprise that corruption and kleptocracy played a role. So Mobutu's role was probably out of the three dictators that we have today was probably the most that was marked by corruption. The regime, as I've mentioned before, operated under kleptocracy where state resources were siphoned off for personal benefit of Mobutu and his inner circle. And Mobutu was known to have amassed an enormous fortune with estimates suggesting that he personally controlled billions of dollars in foreign assets by the end of his rule. And he clearly ruled for a very long time from 1965 to 1997. So clearly during this time period, which is like almost 30, 32 years, he had like amassed billions of dollars. And Mobutu's wealth was often hidden in foreign Swiss bank accounts. And he had a lavish lifestyle, including expensive palaces, luxury cars and international properties. However, the problem with that is that kleptocracy often causes the nation's resources to deplete. And with that, a nation has to rely on foreign aid and loans. And this is something that we learned in macroeconomics. So despite his sort of anti-colonial rhetoric and efforts to efforts at economic self-sufficiency, Mobutu heavily relied on foreign aid and loans throughout his rule. And he was sort of able to secure substantial support from Western nations during the Cold War, particularly from the United States, which saw Mobutu as a strategic ally in the fight against communism in Africa. And the same can be said about Pinochet in Chile as well, who was sort of a dictator that was backed by the US as he sort of supported capitalism. And I'm not going to comment on the US as like sort of whether it was good or bad, but clearly nations have their incentives. And I support US's incentive here because the Cold War, each country had to take a side. So Mobutu was clearly backed by the US, if that makes sense. And his regime received large amounts of foreign aid, but instead of using it to develop the country, much of it was diverted into private accounts or used to maintain the regime's power. And this created a dependency on foreign aid, making the country economically vulnerable. And the IMF, which is the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank also provided loans which were often misused or diverted into Mobutu's personal wealth. And as a result, the national debt of Zaire increased dramatically. So by the 80s and 90s, Zaire's economy was in free fall. The mismanagement of resources combined with the corruption and declining 0.8 led to widespread poverty, high inflation, and a decaying infrastructure. And the country's GDP per capita permitted and basic services like education, healthcare, and public transportation became nearly non-existent. So Zaire, which was once a major producer of minerals like copper, cobalt, and diamonds, saw its mining industry deteriorate as a result of neglect, mismanagement, and a lack of investment. And the lack of diversification in the economy also made it highly vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. And to put this into perspective, Africa is very rich in minerals. So the UAE, which is the United Arab Emirates, we consider it as a beacon of capitalism, wealth, and luxury. And obviously, people often think that it comes from oil money. And while that may be true, Nigeria has more oil than UAE can ever imagine. But look at the disparity between Nigeria and the UAE. And ultimately, it comes to the leadership. And the problem with Zaire's leadership was that Mobutu's regime was characterized by corruption and political repression as well. Political opposition was crushed, and any dissent was met with violence. And thousands of political opponents were imprisoned, tortured, or executed, and the country's press was tightly controlled. And the regime also maintained a cult-like personality around Mobutu, who portrayed himself as the father of the nation. He established a personal brand of nationalism known as authenticity, which sought to raise the colonial influence by renaming the country as Zaire and changing the names of cities and encouraging the use of African names and customs. And talking about legacy, Mobutu's rule left Zaire with a legacy of deep political and economic dysfunction. The wealth of the country was concentrated in the hands of the few, and the vast majority of Zaireans lived in extreme poverty. So the collapse of the Zairean state in 1990s was accelerated by the First Congo War, which happened in 1996 to 1997, which saw Mobutu's regime toppled by the rebellion led by Lohan Desihe Kabila, who would eventually become the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo. And Mobutu fled to Morocco, where he died in exile in 1997. So Mobutu was sort of able to maintain relation with both the Western and Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. He was, he was, there was this non-aligned movement at that time, but Mobutu was sort of with the US and the non-aligned movement. And despite his dictatorial rule and corruption, the US and other Western nations continue to support him due to his anti-communist rhetoric. However, Mobutu's relationship with the foreign donors soured in the 80s and 90s as his regime became more entrenched in corruption and mismanagement. And the final years of Mobutu's rule saw declining international support and increasing economic, political instability in Zaire. So in conclusion, like we can see that Mobutu's economic policy were primarily focused on consolidating his power with little regard for long-term development of Zaire. And his personal focus on enrichment, coupled with this authoritarian governance, led to the destruction of the country's economy and its international sort of reputation as Zaire sort of became known as like IMF bagger. So while Mobutu's rule initially brought some political stability to the country, it ultimately left Zaire in ruins with a broken economy, widespread poverty, and a collapsed infrastructure. So with that being said, would anyone else like to add any insights to the information that I said about Mobutu, Mr. Shazip Kharig, Mr. Supri Nagela, or Mr. Chanju Kim? Yeah, Mr. RM Malik, thank you for that amazing introduction on Mobutu Shazip Kharig. And I would like to talk about his corruption and further the impact of that corruption. So one of the defining characteristics of Mobutu's rule was a state-sponsored corruption, which led to the widespread of embezzlement of national wealth. So Mobutu amassed an estimated 4 to 15 billion in personal wealth by looting the country's resources while the economy collapsed. His luxury lifestyles included multiple palaces, a fleet of private jets, and properties in Europe. Mobutu borrowed heavily from Western countries, but used the money for personal gain rather than country's development, which led to economic collapse of the Zaire, also known as Democratic Republic of the Congo. By the 1980s, Zaire had over $10 billion in foreign debt, making it one of the most indebted country in Africa. And the IMF and World Bank gave Zaire multiple bailout loans, but these funds were often misused or stolen by a corrupted official or Mobutu himself. Also, the Western government supported Mobutu for geopolitical reasons, as he was seen as the Cold War ally against the communism, which allowed him to continue his corruption. So, as an impact of his corruption and other policies, the economy shrank as industrial and agriculture output declined. In the early 1970s, GDP per capita was around $400, but by the 1990s, it had fallen to less than $100. Also, by the 1990s, inflation had reached several thousand percent per year, making money particularly worthless. This was because in the late 1980s, during the final days of his administration, he tried to prevent rising prices by implementing price control policies, but the policies failed and hyperinflation occurred. And then, I would like to ask a question to you guys about how, like, why do you think his effort on preventing rising prices by, like, implementing prices, price control, like policies, why do you think that failed in Zaire's society? Yeah. Chanju, that's a really good question. And I also, I also really appreciate your insights, Chanju. And before, you know, I answer your question again, just, like, adding more insightful comments and my own perspective into the conversation, I'd say that, you know, like, on paper, like, like, we can talk about the Zaire, like, I don't know if you heard this, I think it's pronounced Zaire-nization, which was, like, Mobutu's big economic move in the 1970s. And on paper, it was nationalist. He kicked out foreign business owners and handed over their assets to the Zaireans. But not just any Zaireans, his friends, family, his generals, and people with no clue on how to run an oil company, a coffee export firm, or even a bakery. And the result? It was disaster. Production collapsed, supply chains broke down, and inflation skyrocketed. Investors ran, and Mobutu, he kept cashing in. At one point, he was considered one of the richest men in the world, while the people of Zaire, they were one of the poorest. And hospitals without medicine, schools without teachers, roads that were the most portaled than pavement, but Mobutu's presidential places or like those had marble floors and golden chandeliers. He even flew Concord jets to Paris for shopping trips. And this wasn't just corruption, it was industrial-scale looting with a touch of designer flair. And, like, I'd say that Mobutu didn't destroy the economy like Pol Pot, he hollowed it out. He built a shell of a state, flashy on the outside, but crumbling inside. When his regime finally collapsed in the late 90s, it left behind a fragile, broken economy and a painful question. How much economic damage can one man do when no one dares to say no? And, yeah, so, now answering your question, Chanju, I'm like, I think, like, it was, it's a pretty interesting question, but I'd say that when Mobutu handed over foreign-owned businesses to his loyalists who lacked experience, like, many industries collapsed, agriculture, mining, and manufacturing all took major hits, and as production dropped, supply of goods fell, but the demand remained the same, leading to the price increase. And, another factor is, like, you know, as confidence in the Zarian currency fell, its value kept depreciating. People lost faith in the money itself, which pushed prices even higher as sellers demanded more currency to compensate for the lost value. And, investors, both domestic and foreign, fled due to unpredictability and mismanagement. And, without investment, productivity stayed low and inflation stayed high. So, Changju, in short, I'd say that Mobutu's regime tried to fix rising prices with temporary patches, like price controls and currency adjustments, but inflation is a symptom. His government was feeding the disease, like corruption, inefficiency, and economic sabotage. So, yeah. Mr. Suprit, I see that your hand is raised. Would you like to chime in? I would love to, but unfortunately, it's not working right now. No worries, Mr. Nagela. Everyone's having an internet difficulty today. And for the audience, Suprit is actually in Bangalore right now in his grandparent's house, which is sort of in the outskirts of the city. So, he's facing internet difficulties right now. So, with that being said, I would like to briefly talk and give more statistics about Mobutu Sese's regime in the Democratic People's Republic of Congo. So, I would like to talk about the economic decline and the GDP loss. So, Zaire's GDP per capita fell from around $260 in 1965, which is the year Mobutu took power, to about $100 in 1997 when Mobutu was ousted. So, this drastic decline underscores the extent of the economic mismanagement during his 32 years in power. And Zaire's overall GDP growth was stagnated during Mobutu's rule while the economy shrinking by approximately 5% annually during 1980s and 1990s further shows the level of economic catastrophic that sort of took place. And the country's economic collapse was marked by widespread poverty with over 80% of the population leaving below the poverty line by the time Mobutu was ousted. And Mobutu's regime was heavily reliant on foreign aids and loans as I mentioned before. From the late 1960s to the 1990s Zaire's received an estimated $10 billion in foreign aid much of which was misused or diverted to personal enrichment. And despite receiving a large amount of foreign aid Zaire's external debt of $13 billion by 1997 while Mobutu continued to amass wealth abroad just goes on to show the wealth disparity as well as the heavy corruption that happened. And other than that I would like to talk about the accumulation of personal fortune of around $4 billion to $5 billion by the time Mobutu was ousted. And his wealth was sort of derived from controlling key sectors of the economy including mining, oil, transportation, siphoning of national resources into Swiss bank accounts. and the declining in the key industries is the most important part. Zaire was one of the world's largest producers of copper, cobalt, and diamonds by the late 80s. But these industries saw a sharp decline. For example, the copper production in Zaire dropped from 450 tons to around 50,000 tons by 1997. So in 1970, it was around 450 tons and in 1997, it was 50,000 tons. So that's like around what? That's like around nine times the decline in copper production in Zaire. And we all know that Zaire was heavily reliant on export. So export revenue sort of dropped as well. And unemployment was the biggest sector which was hit because it's estimated that 70% of the population was unable to find stable jobs and majority of the people sought after government jobs for example, in Bangladesh, we have BCS which is a Bangladesh civil service and majority of the bureaucrats in our country they sort of like the majority of the people they wanted bureaucrats in this country and they sort of take the BCS exam in Bangladesh which is like the heavily sought after job. And in 2024 August when the Prime Minister the previous Prime Minister was sort of facing the protest and everything, a majority of it came from the fact that people couldn't find, people couldn't like apply for government jobs because so many people, were applying. There's like what, like 500 seats and then there's like 500,000 people applying for it. So clearly unemployment was the reason Bangladesh saw political tension and the same can be said in Zaire as well because in 1990s when unemployment had soared to 70%, all the people were in the streets and as I've mentioned before there was a very famous lieutenant there was a very famous lieutenant in there named Lohan Desihe Kabila who sort of was sort of supported by the people. So clearly based on the statistics mobile to CSECO had clearly even though he claimed to be a nationalistic guy, he clearly had no sense of nationalism as annual inflation sort of reached 1000% in 1993 and the hyperinflation continued to erode people's savings and sort of the purchasing power and the collapse of any formal economic activity in the country also led to unemployment. So with that being said, I had a question for Mr. Chanju Kim and Mr. Shahzib Karim or Mr. Supreet Nagala. So given the vast sums of foreign aid that Mamuta received during his rule and the international community support for him during the Cold War, how do you guys assess the role of foreign powers in perpetuating kleptocratic regimes? Could this be seen as a failure of international responsibility and what steps could be taken to prevent such economic collapse? Mr. Chanju Kim, Mr. Shahzib Karim or Mr. Supreet Nagala? Okay, so Arif Malik, such a deep and insightful question you have brought up. Okay, so as you already explained, Mobutu Sese Seku's entire rule was a case study in how foreign interference can sustain corrupt and destroy a nation and the US, France, Belgium and these other powers didn't just tolerate Mobutu, they propped him up because he served their interest. They funneled billions into Zere not to develop the country but to keep Mobutu in power as a Cold War pawn against Soviet influence in Africa. So what was the result? A dictator who amassed a fortune of over 5 billion dollars while his people starved. So is foreign intervention always bad? Not necessarily. There are cases where international aid and intervention can do good. For instance, Marshall Plan style investments in post-war Europe worked and the US helped rebuild South Korea and Japan into economic powerhouses. But what's the difference? Those countries had accountability, strong institutions and weren't just puppets like Maputo. In Africa, Asia and Latin America, we've also seen aid used as a tool for control by China or the US rather than actual development. And money flows into dictatorships with no oversight and leaders can use it to buy loyalty, oppress their own people and stash billions in Swiss banks while their countries remain impoverished. Just like what we saw with the Hamburg Port in Sri Lanka. So how do we prevent this? How do we prevent just one power being dropped up by foreign interference and becoming too powerful like Mobuto? And how do we instead use foreign aid to create countries like economic power houses like South Korea or Japan? So the biggest thing is to stop treating authoritarian leaders as strategic partners because just because they serve short-term interests, this doesn't mean they will be good on the long term. The world keeps on making this mistake as well. Mobuto, Karimov, Saddam and even today with Gulf monarchies. It can be argued this is definitely a debated topic but we need to stop prioritizing stability over democracy and human rights. Number two, tying aid to real accountability because if foreign aid is needed it should be tied to clear reforms and transparency not just blank checks to corrupt regimes because this would ensure that the money actually goes into infrastructure, healthcare, education and not just to the ruling elite. And finally, we must strengthen the local institutions with the foreign aid and foreign interference you could say and it shouldn't just serve the foreign interest and this would mean that countries, global powers need to come out of a completely selfish motive and try to actually desire for the other person or the other country's good. So instead of focusing on who's in charge they should focus on building strong local institutions and in this way you would be able to empower civil society, courts and a free press where dictators cannot just siphon off foreign aid unchecked. So in essence I hope this answers your question Arib and I invite definitely invite Chanjo or Shahzeeb to briefly answer the question as well if you would like to. Okay so I'll like really briefly answer the question like so how could we like prevent this kind of repeating mistakes of Zaire. So the global financial system should be should do more to prevent stolen funds from being hidden in the foreign banks as yeah Moboto did and a stronger international cooperation is needed to hold the leaders accountable for the corruption and economic mismanagement. Yeah so generally foreign powers played a major role in enabling Moboto's kleptocracy and prioritizing short-term political gain over the long-term welfare of Zaire. So yeah only through yeah I think this is all. thank you everyone for your great insight. So undoubtedly Mr. Chandru came Mr. Subrit Nagel and Mr. Shahzap Karin for the insight. So undoubtedly we can see that Moboto's regime was clearly marked by heavy corruption and by the fact that he simply did not care enough about the economic sort of development of his country which led to Zaire becoming one of the poorest countries not only in the world but also in Africa despite having such a plentiful bountiful resources as well as plenty of human resources not just natural resources. So with that being said I would like to move into the third big brother for today which is Islam Karimov. So Islam Karimov is the former president of Uzbekistan who ruled from 1991 which is the time period when the USSR was dismantled by Gorbachev I believe and Karimov's economic policies were marked by authoritarian control focused on state-owned enterprises and the exploitation of Uzbekistan's natural resources all of which had significant economic and social consequences for the country and his rule is often characterized by repression human rights violations and efforts to maintain a firm grip on power at any cost. So I would like to talk and give a brief introduction on Karimov's economic policies its impact on Uzbekistan as well as his long-lasting legacy. So first of all Uzbekistan is a country which is located in Central Asia and it's bordered by Turkmenistan to the south Tajikistan to the east Kyrgyzstan as well I believe and then Kazakhstan to the north. So Uzbekistan is known for the Silk Road and the major city route known as Samarkand which I believe everyone all read during social studies last year in grade 8 and it's basically like a landlocked country in Central Asia so its geography is very important so clearly it's landlocked and it doesn't have any plentiful natural resources like there. However Karimov's government pursued policies of economic isolation even though the country itself is very isolated as it is landlocked and this economic isolation was sort of prevalent throughout its rule. So he sought to keep Uzbekistan largely self-sufficient and avoid full integration into the global economy and this meant limiting foreign investment and trade relations and often rejecting western-oriented reforms that could undermine his regime's control and as a result the country missed out on significant foreign capital and technology that could have spurred economic growth and Karimov maintained strict control over key sectors of the economy with the government control essential industries especially in the cotton production and natural gas and Uzbekistan became one of the world's largest producers of cotton but Karimov's policies led to inefficiencies and exploitation within these industries for example in cotton the government controlled 90% of the cotton sector including the collection and sale of cotton and this left very little room for private enterprise and stifled any entrepreneurial growth outside the state-run sphere additionally there was forced labor and human rights violation one of the most notorious aspects of Karimov's economic policies was the use of forced labor in Uzbekistan's cotton industry every year hundreds and thousands of people including children and high school students were forced to work in the cotton fields often under harsh conditions to meet state quotas human rights organizations and the united nations repeatedly condemned the use of forced labor and according to reports as I was reading about 1 million people were forced into the cotton fields annually a practice that continued throughout Karimov's rule and despite international pressure the Uzbek government did not fully abandon this practice during his time in power and while forced labor is a very well-known issue international bodies like the world bank and the ILO which is the international labor organization only increased pressure on Uzbekistan later in Karimov's regime however it was clear that economic growth in this sector came at the cost of human working in these grueling conditions in the cotton fields and other than that I would also like to talk about some of the economic reforms and failures so after gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 Karimov maintained a policy of gradual economic reforms focusing on preserving state control and rather than embracing rapid privatization and market reforms which are typical of post Soviet transition Uzbekistan took a more cautious approach which Karimov justified as a means of avoiding economic instability so first I would like to talk about the privatization while other post-Soviet states began privatizing their state owned industries like for example Ukraine Karimov took a more conservative approach and only limited privatization occurred and much of the country's economy remained state controlled particularly in strategic sectors like energy transport and agriculture and as for currency and exchange rate issues Karimov regime also kept a rigid exchange rate system and controlled the national currency which is the SOM and the policy was clearly disastrous because if a government tries to control a state's currency it often leads to the currency sort of being overvalued than what it actually is so this policy resulted in a black market for currency and severe discrepancy between the official exchange rate and the market rate leading to a high inflation and a lack of foreign currency in the country and inflation was very high as well because it averaged around 15% per annum contributing to the shrinking populations purchasing power and stifling the development of the middle class and this was exacerbated by frequent government interventions in the economy such as restrictions on foreign aid which led to inefficiencies in the market and as for natural resource management Uzbekistan is even this landlocked it's pretty rich in natural resources particularly cotton and natural gas and under Karimov the government pursued policies of export-driven growth in these sectors but they were mocked by mismanagement and over reliance on commodity sectors cotton for instance remain Uzbekistan's largest export contributing significantly to currency earnings but this over-dependent on one commodity left the economy vulnerable to price fluctuations and the same was true for natural gas exports which saw declining revenues due to global shifts in energy markets and the inability to attract foreign investment in the energy sector not only that Karimov's reluctance to diversify Uzbekistan's economy beyond agriculture and energy proved to be a serious hindrance the lack of industrial development meant that Uzbekistan's economy remained highly dependent on a few sectors which ultimately stunted the growth of other industries like manufacturing technology and services and no surprise there were wealth inequality however not as bad of a wealth inequality as there and other than that legacy wise while Uzbekistan's economy showed growth during the early 2000s due to high commodity prices which was not due to the fact that the world was shifting to a more tech sector so commodities like natural gas was reliant and by the end of Karimov's reign the economy was showing signs of stagnation so post Karimov's death in 2016 his successor Shafkod Mirziyo Yev began to implement economic reforms aimed at issues inherited during Karimov's era over the over dependence and cotton continues to impact Uzbekistan's economy so even though Karimov was sort of authoritarian leader who failed to diversify the economy while researching I could not find any sort of viable sources to prove his corruption so even though he was a dictator who left a legacy of forced labor mismanagement of natural resources and economic stagnation in my opinion and Paul Pod as the economy did not necessarily decline during his reign but the currency did lose its value so what do you guys think about Islam Karimov's reign and its impact on Uzbekistan Mr. Shahzib Karim Mr. Supriy Nagala Mr. Chandru Kim if you could please provide some insights into this matter as well yeah sure so thank you for your thank you for the introduction on our last big brother and yeah adding my own perspective I'd say that you know I'm talking about Uzbekistan like from 1989 until his death in 2016 Karimov ruled Uzbekistan with all the warmth of a Soviet era typewriter he promised order he delivered it with repression censorship and a command economy that moved at a glacial space but unlike Pol Pot or Mobuto Karimov wasn't trying to destroy the economy he was trying to freeze it in time after the fall of the Soviet Union many newly independent states embraced market liberalization privatization and reform but Karimov he said not so fast he kept tight control over the Uzbek economy currency was heavily restricted and imports and exports were micromanaged and the state monopolized key sectors like cotton energy and gold why because control equals power and for Karimov nothing was more valuable than total stability but this stability came at a cost a big one cotton for instance remained the country's economic backbone but instead of mechanized farming Uzbekistan's government relied on forced labor yes even children had to harvest every year students teachers doctors were pulled from their schools and jobs to pick cotton under the scorching sun the world condemned it and Karimov shrugged productivity didn't matter obedience did foreign investment extremely limited innovation stifled entrepreneurs were viewed with suspicion the underground economy became more dynamic than the legal one and still if you look at the numbers you'd be tempted to say it wasn't that bad because the GDP growth was steady inflation remained under control and debt levels were low but those numbers were tightly controlled like everything else in Uzbekistan this was an economy that functioned but couldn't evolve so I'd say that like in the bigger picture Karimov's Uzbekistan was a paradox an economy that worked just enough to prevent collapse but never enough to thrive it was efficient in being inefficient and dangerously allergic to change his rule shows that economic stagnation doesn't always come from chaos and sometimes it comes from a ruler who values silence over progress so Islam Karimov's legacy it was a controlled economy a muzzled society and a cautionary tale when a regime fears change more than failure it locks itself and its people into a permanent holding pattern Mr. Chanju Kim or Mr. Subit Nagala would you like to chime in yes Mr. Chanju Kim okay so Islam Karimov had a clear vision to build a self-reliant centrally managed economy and for over two decades he kept tight control over nearly every sector but what did this mean for industrial development in this country so let's break it down so first and foremost Uzbekistan's economy under Karimov was driven by state controlled industries and many of which followed a legacy of Soviet style planning one of the cornerstones was cotton often referred as white gold just like Arab said before cotton was Uzbekistan's main export for years but the state controlled every aspect of it from production and pricing to export profits farmers were forced to sell their cottons to the government at a price far below the market rates and during the harvest thousands of teachers students even doctors were sent into the fields as forced labor it brought in revenue but at the tremendous social cost then there is a gold Uzbekistan is actually one of the world's top 10 gold producer home to massive Mirumtiao gold mine one of the largest open pit mine on earth gold mining along with natural gas and uranium was ran entirely by state owned companies like Navoy Mining and Uzbek Neffe Gas these industries made significant contributions to the economy but profits were centralized and corruption thrived in the absence of transparency or competition another flagship project of the country was the automobile industry in the mid 90s Uzbekistan partnered with South Korea's Daewoo to create domestic car manufacture what would later became GM Uzbekistan it was a point of national pride and people were riding Uzbek made cars and thousands of jobs were created but again high traffic tariffs protected these companies from competition the resort expensive low quality vehicles that struggled to compete outside of Uzbekistan despite heavy investments in sectors like textiles fertilizers and chemicals much of industrial infrastructures were outdated relying on old Soviet machinery innovations were stifled and private businesses were discouraged everything required government approval there was little room for risk enter apprenticeship or growth foreign investors most of them stayed away strict currency controls trade barriers and reputation for arbitrary legal decision made Uzbekistan a tough place to the business so in conclusion the state provided a job and kept the economy afloat and avoided the chaotic transition that some of other former Soviet republics experienced but it also locked Uzbekistan into a rigid system so I would like to ask a question for your in so could the preservation of Soviet style state enterprises be seen as strength or weakness of the current economic model Mr. Shazipkirin I see there are hands raised would you like to chime in yeah Chandru could you please repeat your question yeah yeah sure could the preservation of Soviet style state enterprises be seen as strength or the weakness of Karimov's economic model so yeah Chandru to answer your question briefly here I think it could be seen as a double edged sword there's always the strengths and weaknesses in both sides of the story but most people would say it would be leaning towards more of a weakness of his regime and his rule because as we had previously talked about he had really harsh regulations and from the outside it did seem like everything was going well but internally they were having a lot of issues and things weren't going as planned the citizens didn't feel at home they weren't treated as humans Karimov's regime it was all about obedience so yeah Chandru I'd say that it had a lot of weaknesses his style of rule had a lot of weaknesses and it really isolated the citizens of his nation that that was such an interesting question Chandru and also a very interesting answer by you Shahzeb and me personally I don't think I couldn't have said it any better so what I wanted to also talk about was also Karimov and how we exploded 9-11 because you see 9-11 changed the world it reshaped foreign policy created entire wars and gave governments across the globe a blank check for repression as long as they called it fighting terrorism and no one played that game better than Islam Karimov now before 9-11 Uzbekistan wasn't exactly on Washington's radar Karimov had been running the country since the fall of the Soviet Union building up a classic strongman dictatorship torture political prison camps zero opposition but after the twin towers fell all he had to do was rebrand his repression as counter terrorism and suddenly he had a full backing of the United States Karimov sold Uzbekistan as a front line state against radical Islam the US needed military bases in Central Asia for the invasion of Afghanistan and Karimov handed them the Kashi Kanabad Airbus K2 as the US military called it and in return America funneled hundreds of millions in aid straight into his government no questions asked and you never know most probably he did not use that aid for its main purpose of aid and most of it probably went through many people's pockets through corruption but here's the kicker Karimov's version of fighting terrorism wasn't just about stopping Al-Qaeda it was about crushing any form of opposition if you criticized the government you were branded an extremist and if you practiced Islam outside of state control you were a terrorist and thousands were arrested tortured some literally bowled alive in prison and this was all of Karimov's strategy to ensure that there was no opposition to bring him back down onto the ground so the big question is did the US know absolutely there were reports human rights groups were screaming about it but as long as Karimov kept the bases open the west looked the other way and it wasn't until 2005 when Uzbek troops massacred hundreds of protesters in Andijan that the US finally pulled back by then though Karimov had already secured Russian and Chinese backing and he did not need the US anymore so this just like it's just a rhetorical question how much responsibility does the US have in propping up brutal regimes like Karimov and why is the US always interfering in other countries and sidelining humanitarian problems just for their own benefit and that's obviously very selfish as many people die and are massacred in persecution as well thank you for that question so yeah clearly there's a correlation that we can see like the US supporting regimes but obviously it's for the interest of the US so moving on so for conclusion today for Big Brothers and their economies I would like to talk briefly to give a summary of the Pol Pot and Islam Karimov so Pol Pot regime was sort of radical in the way that it wanted to transform Cambodia into a rural agrarian and classless society through the agricultural revolution and clearly economically speaking it was a disaster it sort of isolated Cambodia and through the four years that Paul dreamed 25% of the population was massacred so clearly Paul Pod from an economic standpoint he didn't know at all what he was doing and he wasn't incentivized for corruption as well he simply was a madman in the sense that he wanted to kill people for Mobutu he sort of knew what he was doing he was corrupted and he wanted everything not for the interest of the country but for self interest and through Zeranization he attempted to sort of nationalize all the industries and take control which led to the highly centralized and corrupt system in Zer and clearly economically speaking the Democratic Republic of Congo is still one of the poorest countries in Africa as Mobutu's rule in corruption and lastly for Islam Karimov he wasn't a corrupt leader however he was very authoritarian and he maintained a state controlled economy with a focus on cotton production and natural gas exports and while the economy sort of stagnated it didn't necessarily decline other than the fact that there was high inflation and poverty rates reached around 27% by the time of his death so due to the economic stagnation the GDP per capital remained low however widespread corruption even though Karimov himself wasn't that much involved the bureaucrats in his government were so corruption remained entrenched and legacy wise it has left economic stagnation and human rights abuses however if we're talking about human rights in my opinion Pol Pot was the most disastrous then Mobutu and Islam Karimov and for economically speaking in terms of who ran the economy best I mean no one did in particular but compared like comparatively speaking Islam Karimov was sort of the one leading in economy then Mobutu and then Pol Pot so is that something that everyone agrees with yeah I would agree with that conclusion I completely agree with you same thank you everyone for your agreement so yeah that's the conclusion for Big Brothers and their economies Paul and Islam Karimov and we did a comparative analysis on their governance human rights abuses and economic management as well as talked about the authoritarian trades and their long-lasting consequences of their rule so Mr. Chanjo Kim before we depart for today would you like to give your experiences in being in the Dollar Dialogue podcast and could you like briefly give a conclusion on your experience today before we depart for today okay so it was really an amazing time to talk about this really interesting topic with you as it was my big dream and I think I gained a significant amount of knowledge about these big brothers and their economics and yeah thank you very much to Mr. Arim Malik Mr. Shahzakarim and Mr. Subrith Nagela thank you Mr. Chanju Kim so yes to the audience this is the end of the podcast episode 43 Big Brothers and the Economist Paul and Islam Karimov with Chanju Kim so thank you thank you to the audience for listening in for today and we'll see you next time with another very interesting topic and with another very interesting guest speaker goodbye Wo social not kirke Thank you.
