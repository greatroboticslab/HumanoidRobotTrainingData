Howto & Style
 G'day everyone we're just going to have a bit of a general cleanup around here on this chilly wet autumn day well it's not is it quite warm actually blue skies no rain there's still time to get some of the plants cleaned up a bit some of the plants out because their crops have finished and some new ones in so what are we going to do today we're going to clean up the mint we're going to get rid of our eggplant which is past it's used by date and we'll place it with carrots and the reason for that I shall explain now mint goes a bit funny this is actually apple mint I think from memory that I grew from seed we're just going to cut all the dead stuff off it doesn't need a new basket at some point yeah we can tell if it's apple mint by the smell it's apple mint and I take every dead bit off and if you look here we've got some lovely new growth so this should come good ready for next summer when we'll have some more apple mint but I will put it in a new basket these aren't very good they start to collapse and all the water comes out we've got the same sort of issue with our strawberries so we'll just cut some of the dead stuff off there might cut some of this dead stuff off too get around the other side later but we've still got some living things on there but we need to just trim it back for the cold weather there we go not looking healthy but he should come back we pulled out our eggplant from this bed here as I mentioned there's something about putting things in this eggplant bed eggplant is quite a hungry feeder so there's not going to be a lot of nutrients in this in this bed and it's quite sandy not a lot of organic matter either but guess what that's great for carrots so I'm going to nip out and grab some more carrot seeds we're going to just make a little bit of carrots up here probably just some fairly standard ones or the rainbow ones if they've got them and hopefully a couple months time we'll have lots more fresh carrots got a few up the back but need more this one here I think I need to clean out as well because I don't think there's anything growing in it used to have cucumbers still got the garlic chives but that's about it so what I'm thinking is I'll build that up just a fraction with some piggy post and we'll put some beetroot in that one and I've got an empty pot over here which I'm going to put one of my new trees in so hang about and we'll see how we get that lot done so what I've got from Daly's nursery because I just wanted to try it is a black pepper tree I'm not quite sure how big this is there we go it gets to two to five meters but by being in a pot we should be able to keep it down to a couple of meters it's self-pollinating the reason I wanted to try pepper is I used to spend a lot of time in Sri Lanka working and the pepper they grow there is absolutely superb it is very different to what we buy locally if you're just buying the chip peppercorns and I want to see if growing my own will be any good so he's going to go over in that pot we're going to clean this fella out except for our garlic chives might grab some of the seeds though so we're going to put some beetroot in there not carrots and I've just got some fairly generic beetroot these are Detroit from Aldi more Detroit from Happy Valley seeds glow beetroot more Aldi beetroot so we'll just put some in there we'll plant them fairly closely together and sit them out as we need them get some baby beets and let some of the others grow to full size for pickling all right let's get that one cleaned up so this is my garlic chive and I'm just going to grab a few seeds which I'll probably just give away because I don't use that many garlic chives and this one will be good for what we need oh it's shame to waste them so we just rub those off there's a stink bug just blow the light seed casings off and here we have more garlic chive seeds than we will ever need I'm just going to put them away we'll come back and clear out that bed okay so we're going to pop this out use that for my cucumbers I said never throw anything away all right we've got our piggy pots which is wonderful stuff now put a really good whack of it in there like so we're going to dig that through that is going to give lots of organic matter to our beetroot what I'll also do and I'll get some earthworm casting since I've got so many of them maybe we'll get some earthworms active in here too a bulletproof a bulletproof garlic chives yeah I'll just get a bit of earthworm castings I actually might put some of this where the carrots are going as well just to get some earthworms in there so that's plenty eggshells and all kinds of goodies in there lots of volunteer plants probably from tomatoes and capsicum and things that have been composted in there so that won't do any harm all right that's nicely mixed in now we're going to do as I said we're going to over sew and we'll thin them out when we need them have some baby beets all right all right i don't know how old that one is we might not use it if i do them for the oldie detroit beetroot They're definitely over sowing. All right, just cover them up. We'll give them a water in. Okay, that's done. Let's get over the back and get our pepper tree in. This had my star fruit in it. Seed that I grew from seed. And as you can see, it didn't make it. Oh well, we'll try again. Let's dig in there and see what we've got. We'll need to mulch it as well. It's not looking too bad. All right, dig that through. Lovely stuff, this piggy post. Nice deep hole for him. Good boy. Don't want to disturb the roots too much, so we'll just pop him in. We'll get some mulch and mulch it as well. There we go. Need a bigger steak. And another one. Need another one for over there. Little bit of this nice soft tie. Should hold him there. That'll keep him going. There we go. And we'll just let them grow up there. Nip them off when they get about six or seven feet tall. Six feet tall. Don't want to be able to reach. And try and turn it into a bit of a bush. All right. It's clear up here. All right. As we're tidying up a little bit here. I'm not sure my strawberries here have actually made it through. So I'm going to get a little bit of piggy pops in these. Just over the top. And that was a spearmint that certainly might come back next year. We'll leave it and see. And see. I'm going to get some little bit of piggy pops in these. Just over the top. And that was a spearmint that certainly might come back next year. We'll leave it and see. In the meantime, I'm going to put some of my various basil in here. Now the basil. Even if we don't use it, this will give a really nice aroma around here. nice basils in here. Now the basil even if we don't use it will give a really nice aroma around here and attract some bees. So generally just a good thing to put in. Right I'm going to loosen that up a bit. We'll pop some cinnamon basil in here again using my little bottom press. Isn't that cute? I really like those. I'm still hoping my strawberries will come back in summer but if they don't, they don't. One last thing I'll show you. Bruce is no longer a grow house at the moment. Bruce is full of mushrooms. So I've got up at the top here there's blue smedges in buckets. That's my humidifier that I bought. Down here we've got some king oyster. I'm not sure it's going to grow because that's from very old grain spawn that I got before Christmas. But I'm giving it a bit of time to see if it does. More blue smedges and leftovers just in a small bag. So this is the environment I'm growing mushrooms in now. It has heat mats there for when we need them. But humidifier is the main thing. And now that it's meant to be cooling down we might be able to grow mushrooms again. Well there we go. Just a little bit of a clean up. A little bit of planting. I'm watering those beetroot seeds in. Get that ready for carrots. Water my pepper tree in. So what are you up to this autumn if you're in the southern hemisphere? What are you up to in spring if you're not? Let me know in the comments. We've got lots more to do out here. Give you an update later on. Enjoy life. We'll catch you out here. Blue sky. Nothing but blue skies. Oh I see. Blue sky. Real skies. Oh I see. Oh I see.
