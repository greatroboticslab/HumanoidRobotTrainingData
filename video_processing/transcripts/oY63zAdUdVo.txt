 okay just a little video showing off the tractor kind of a little bit about it a little bit of a walk around and one thing I kind of pointed out we that we were gonna do and actually just did it but I the intro that I made before we did it didn't work out so I'm just redoing it right now but with the bucket the idea was we've got the step hitch receiver we were gonna put on it took it down to the neighbors he welded it on I've got some video we're about to see of it and then we'll see the close of the video all right so we just got back doing a little welding and uh like I said it's just a little uh step bumper receiver 25 bucks at Harbor Freight something like that they're pretty cheap I mean these things are you pick these up on eBay actually made for the tractor uh quite a bit more expensive but uh buddy of mine you know was doing some welding got it mounted right on front of the tractor here I can uh use it for moving trailers around also uh you can buy you know hooks and some other uh little little attachments that slide in those hitches I know they sell hooks they sell stuff like that where you can hook a chain up to it and then with the chain uh you know you kind of use it to pick stuff up I'm probably gonna mount some hooks on the side of it too I got a couple other plans for this tractor but anyway hope you like the video if you if you liked it please uh subscribe give a like maybe leave a comment it's all appreciated again it's Matt the Momo Hunter from McGee Farms you
