 Good morning, my name is John from Dade Home Inspections. Are you paying too much for your homeowner's insurance? What can you do about it? You can call us at Dade Home Inspections and we'll perform a wind mitigation inspection. What is a wind mitigation inspection? It's an inspection that we perform on your home. And if your home qualifies, you can get up to 88% off your homeowner's insurance. What we'll do is we'll come and we'll see what would happen if a hurricane hit your home. How would it withstand the wind? How are your trusses connected to the walls? How is your decking connected to your trusses? Do you have hurricane covering for all your windows and doors? How will your garage door withstand? We offer you a guarantee. If your home doesn't qualify for these discounts, we let you know what's wrong. And if you fix it, we'll come back and re-inspect it for you. But if we can't get you any discounts, we don't charge you anything. Our philosophy is we want a satisfied customer. No discount, no charge. So for all your wind mitigation inspections, four point inspection, full home inspections, termite inspections, you name it. If it has to do with real estate, we do it. And who should you call? We'll call it home inspections at 305-378-2312.
