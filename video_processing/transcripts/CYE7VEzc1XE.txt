 Just when I thought spring had arrived for good, we woke up to a blanket of snow. The kind that doesn't stay long, but reminds you that the seasons changed slowly, in layers, not all at once. From the beginning of the April, I started working at our local garden center again. It's a small place, full of green life, soil and that quiet hum of people who love plants. It's still early in the season and the mornings are cool, sometimes even frosty. But there's something special about watching the place come back to life. Most of the work is simple, moving plants, sweeping gravel, tidying displays. It's physical in the best way. Your hands stay busy, but your mind gets to breathe. There's a quiet written to it. Bird song in the background, the smell of soil and wood, little green signs of life all around. I learn something new every day here. About plants, yes. But also about patience, presence and the pace of nature. It's a kind of slow magic and I'm grateful to be part of it. I couldn't hold it. I couldn't hold it back. We were running on that open shore. No saddle on his back. I couldn't hold it back. I couldn't hold it back. I couldn't hold it. I couldn't hold it back. I couldn't hold it. I couldn't hold it There I lay beneath the canopy On the gilded forest path When an ecstasy came over me And all that I could do is laugh I gotta hold it back I gotta hold it I gotta hold it back I gotta hold it back How could I hold it I gotta hold it back From our heads to toes We are standing with the overflow On the weekend we took a trip to the city We've been wanting to plant a row of tuya trees for a while now Something about evergreens feels like a quiet protection It grows slowly but steadily Just like we do We were swimming with the silver moon Dancing like a maniac Then we raised each other to the room We also picked up a few other small things We also picked up a few other small things Oil for the terrace, crocs, cleaning supplies I was running low on And a few gardening tools I love this part of spring When everything feels like a fresh start Even inside the home Then we loaded up the car and headed home I was already imagining how the tuyas would look once planted How they'd sway in the wind and stand tall over the years to come Almost full of little growissez Just as if the unicorns and beautiful I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Maybe we should just be friends. All this whole black knots of rope has made of mess. In between everything that we had. Back home we got to work the next day. We've been dreaming about planting these for a while now. A soft little green wall along the edge of the driveway. There's something so grounding about planting trees. They ask you to think long term, to believe in the years ahead. It's a quiet kind of hope. We spaced them carefully, gave them deep holes and tucked them in with fresh soil. A lot of water, a pat on the root ball and they were home. They don't look like much yet, but that's the magic of it. You plant something small and with time it becomes something you couldn't imagine not having. It's hard to believe that we're coming undone. Getting over our fears while we're under the gun. There's no making sense of the things that they say. I know we're better than that anyway. I've been thinking maybe you should come back home. We can tell them we're just seeing how they're going back home. Everyone thinks that they know better. All alone, we had it all again. It's hard to believe that we're coming undone. Getting over our fears while we're under the gun. There's no making sense of the things that they say. I know we're better than that anyway. I know we're better than that anyway. To be even longer than that instead. We have, and as I said that, probably threw it all again. According to Europe, all the things that they're making was moreŒºŒ¨ There is now that It's hard to believe that it's perfectly we're on the same way. Don't believe that if we manage, maybe you'll be doing something Just like it, play it part In the way youll need to make the difference. The question is that if we're in the catalog, We are getting to mark a chance of theCU line as well, You got to make it out. The place is low, yeah, you cut through the noise I wish I knew, I wish I knew what you were thinking of One last drink before it's time to go home I had my chance but I screwed it up once more It's been years and it still kills me your dynamite, pretty Hold on, darling, don't let me down Hope that you feel it too, just give me a sign Cause I know, I know it ain't over You feel it too, I'm so on to this time Hold on, darling, don't let me go I wanna see if you're the source, just don't make close Cause I know, I know it ain't over You feel it too, I'm so on to this time Lost in the crowd, yeah, you drown out the sound I wish I knew, I wish I knew what you were thinking about It's this thing in my head Delusional to love, die, babe At least we stand up chisthen Right, it's been years and it still kills me your dynamite, pretty Hold on, darling, don't let me down Hold on, darling, don't let me down Hope that you feel it too, just give me a sign Cause I know, I know it ain't over You feel it too, I'm so on to this time Hold on, darling, don't let me go I wanna see if you're the source, just hold me close Cause I know, I know it ain't over You feel it too, I'm so on to this time I'll leave alone and just like that, I'm back to being sober We'll leave it all aside, cause this way will never be over You'll leave alone and just like that, you're back to being sober You feel it too, I'm so on to this time There's something about pansies that feels like a gentle invitation to spring They're small, but bold Braving the last chills of the season with their little faces turned up towards the sun They're one of the first flowers I always reach for this time of year Hardly enough to handle a surprise frost Yet bright enough to bring real colour back into the garden I love tucking them into containers by the front door Or slipping them into bare spots in the garden beds It's such a simple way to live an upper space And remind yourself, yes, the cold days are ending They come in so many shades Deep purples, soft yellows, gentle whites And somehow they always look like they're smiling A little joy, blooming early For me, they mark the true beginning of spring Not when the calendar says so But when there's colour in the dirt again Pansies are such a cheerful little things But they do have their preferences They love cool spring air And can handle short frosts Even down to around minus five It's part of what makes them such a good early bloomer They like a drink about once a week Depending on the weather But not too much Their roots don't like to sit in soggy soil A little plant food every other week Can help them bloom their best And if you pinch off the spent flowers They'll keep making more They're happiest in sunny or partly sunny spots With well-draining soil But when the heat of summer rolls in Days start to fade The muggy air is just too much for them So for now, while the days are still mild I'll let them shine A short but beautiful season That's part of their charm It gets me almost every time In the midst of summer Watching it in full bloom Always makes me wonder When we were When we were Just keep bare feet on warm as fuck We held our dreams within our hands It happens every time I wonder how But I can see my life so clearly now Over there If it goes down A shortbbling Guys We should not speak But when we want to fais calls We have—è–Ω We left The unreliber Bread Gave We cut You Me She I We Should grillingÂõûÂæ© It happens every time I wonder how But I can see my life so clearly now I only miss you when I close my eyes It's amazing how much can sift in just a week. The snow melts, the soil softens and suddenly your hands are in the dirt, your eyes on the horizon. This season is waking up slowly and so am I. One planted tree, one flower at a time. There's still more to come. More seeds, more soil, more simple joys. But for now this feels like enough. These early spring days are full of motion but not rush. Growth is happening everywhere, slowly, surely. And I'm learning to move with it. Thanks for spending some time with me in the garden. See you again soon in part 2.
