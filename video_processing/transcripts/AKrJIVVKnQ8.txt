 In two villages in Zimbabwe, school attendance in recent years has been steadily improving thanks to an IAEA FAO project. Drought made it difficult for farmers to generate enough income to send their children to school. For about three consecutive years we had poor rains and poor harvests. So the impoverished citizens could not afford school fees for quite some time. To support farmers, the IAEA helped the government introduce a drip irrigation pilot project that reduces water use by half. Using isotopic techniques, scientists calculated the exact amount of water and fertilizer needed for tomatoes and other vegetables. This allows farmers to save both of these precious resources. Drip irrigation is also more efficient, leading to more crops. Adding fertilizer to the soil also increases the harvest. The situation with food security has quite greatly improved. Like for instance, where the farmers used to have a yield of say five tons per hectare or six tons per hectare, now it has almost tripled. That means more food for the children and more money for their schooling. I can now manage to pay the school fees for my children from the money I got from the drip irrigation system. I also improved my household and I can also now buy food for my children. I feel happy because my parents bought complete school uniform and stationery for me and I expect to pass with flying colors at the end of the year. With more crop per drop, the education of children in these areas is safe for now. This IAEA supported project is also helping farmers elsewhere in Africa.
