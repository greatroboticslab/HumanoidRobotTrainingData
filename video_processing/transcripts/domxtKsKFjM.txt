 After the Meanings gibt es eine älternde Wşaur Imized einer großen Uh appeals either dieur vom typischenreichen grippe ist bei uns die temperature prä�� Räuste in maneeren immer nur nutzen Hello, ladies from Thailand are here. Today's video is going to be an unboxing unboxing of a couple of solar powered devices. I'm convinced that solar power is the way to go and I've tried a few things with regard to solar and I think that the small items are probably the way to go. So today I'm going to unbox two items and I think it'll be very useful in the future. And the first one is, let's have a look, I ordered these from Lazada and they came today very very fast, only three days for delivery. Now I've already done a few solar things, I've got solar powered lights, flood lights around the house and they last for 10 or 12 hours. I'm very very impressed by the prices of what they are. And this is obviously a solar panel and a light fitting. It comes with the remote control as well. So this is the light fitting that I've got and the reason why I bought this is because you can easily change the batteries in these. Now there's pictures here of the flood lights that I've put around the house, they're a little bit more difficult to change the batteries once they need to be changed because eventually the batteries will stop recharging and you need to replace them. So I'm going to do a breakdown of this and see how it works and how it fits together and I think you'll be impressed. And the battery is already in there so we'll have a look for being able to replace the battery once it's worn out and it's past its usefulness. So as you can see, as far as being able to get access to the battery and replace it, it's also simple, very very simple for DIY installation and that's all I'm dealing with is DIY installation and those people can actually do it themselves. So I'll put it back together now and we'll see it when it's working. Two screws, that's all it takes to be able to put it back together again. Plastic housing, so waterproof and a remote control which helps everything along. So I'm sort of impressed. It's a cheap light fitting but we'll get some ideas to how good it is once we plug it in. So the solar panel which charges it up. Again, I intend to extend the solar panel lead because it's never long enough to be able to to put it where you need to put it to be able to put the light up. I'm going to use these lights for outside, that's what I'm intending to use them for. So we'll be able to put these onto the roof or in some position where it will be able to charge everything up. So the lead really isn't that long, maybe it's a couple of meters long. So what we're going to do, I'm going to put it in the sun for now and then see how it charges up and see how good it charges it up. Because as it comes now it's probably uncharged. So let's put this in the sun and see what we can do with it. So let's put the light in the sun, see if we can get it charged up. Hopefully that should charge that up. So let's put the light in the sun. Okay, that's the first one unboxing done of what it is. The light fit in. Some batteries, some screws, some raw plugs. I say we'll deal with that when we come to fit it up. I don't really know where I'm going to put it yet, but it will go somewhere. I don't really know where we can get it. So I'll put it in the sun. I'm going to put it in the sun. I'm going to put it in the sun. Now I'm going to put it in the sun. I'm going to put it in the sun. I'm going to put it in the sun. And the second thing that I've got. Now we use this particular item all the time in the house. We have air conditioning, but my wife doesn't like air conditioning. So I bought, let me show you. In the box, well packed. And so let's see what we've got. It is a solar powered fan. Now as I say this comes with, it's a 16 inch fan, which is what the same size that we use already, but electric. And the idea is with this is to see how much the battery lasts for, because we use the fan nearly all day. And we certainly use the fan on the night time in the bedroom. So we're going to see how long it lasts for. Even if we would just be able to use it during the day, some sort of saving of electricity. Now that's the size of the panel. To charge the battery that comes with it. Now I'll leave some prices as to what I paid for these, towards the end of the video. So you can see exactly how much I've paid for these things. As I say, a 16 inch fan. So here we go. We're going to put it all together. Now my idea with this is because I like playing around with the electrics and things like that. Is that if this sort of breaks with a, with a, I don't expect it to last very long because it's wasn't expensive. But the idea is if the controls break, we have a 12 volt fan, which can be controlled by the solar panels I've got. Now I've got some bigger solar panels. Now, for those people who've watched my programs before, with regard to solar, I had an inverter, which was linked up to the, to the grid system. But unfortunately the gardener came around one day and he pebble dashed the, the panel and smashed all the glass on top of the solar panel. And also there was a lightning storm. And I think that blow up the diodes within the inverter. So it wasn't worth replacing the inverter, but I'm still a fan of solar panels and solar power is why I bought this. because I want to see if this gives a return, a quicker return than buying another solar panel and inverter. So I'm going to put all this lot together. So we're actually joined by our premier panel. We'll... But that! We'll see you next time. Coatечет P Fur spouses Uh, beautiful. 3 From port 6 so let's go and plug it in and see what it does see if we can get it charged up so again it's got a phone charger dc charger so let's go and see what it does and let's do the same with the fan put that in the sun and let's see if it can charge light is working it's working from the sun it's been a week now since i bought this this solar panel and light fitting and what do i think of it if you watch this video here you'll actually see how easy it was to fit to the roof without actually not fastening it to the the tiles on the roof it's easy to do took less than 10 minutes to do and the results i'm not overly impressed now this light here only lasts for maybe eight hours when it's fully charged up it's fully charged up whereas these ones here last for the full 12 hours or so it might have something to do with the size of the battery i don't really know but they give an impressive light out for the eight hours that they're that they're lit for but i'd want them to be up for 10 or 12 hours it gets dark here in thailand about six o'clock in the evening and it gets late again six o'clock in the morning so they need to be on for at least 12 hours for my um likeability of it but eight hours it's better than nothing at all isn't it i suppose and it's free so eight hours it's not too bad for the price uh 450 baht i think they were so less than 10 pounds and it's free once it's on so it's not too bad so what about this the fan the solar panel fan now again if you look at the box here it says three hours on fast speed um now again i've had it a week and i've had the solar panel going out in the sunshine for all day and it's fully charged up with the solar panel the best i can get out of it is two hours i can get three hours if the solar panel is in the sun whilst it's been operated during the day so with the battery and the solar panel you can get three hours but it doesn't say that in the instructions or any of the literature that comes with it so again a little bit disappointing on evening time that's what we're going to use it for two hours at the very very most and again on the box it says up to eight hours on on slow speed now impossible doesn't give you the full eight hours so again a little bit disappointing with that but for a thousand or just over a thousand baht what could you expect maybe as if i put a little bit bigger battery in it but i've got other ideas out how i can adapt this fan so it can be used with my bigger solar panels but this is all in the future with regard to solar panels i'm a big fan of solar power and i will make the solar power work in this house whilst i'm here so from les retired and living the dream in thailand till the next video bye for now
