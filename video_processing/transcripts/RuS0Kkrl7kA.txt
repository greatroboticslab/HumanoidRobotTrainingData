 This one plant gave me 30 plus zucchinis. Here's how to grow your own zucchini factory. One plant in hills mound soil 12 inch high to prevent rot and warm roots faster. To know fruits? Hand pollinate. Swipe male flowers, long stems, onto female flowers, baby zucchini at base. Three water the base wet leaves attract mildew. Pro tip, add mulch to keep soil moist. Pick them small, 6 to 8 inch, unless you want zucchini baseball bats. Harvest every 2 to 3 days. Now you'll have so many, you'll be giving them to neighbors. Want my favorite zucchini recipe?
