The journey of a green onion might surprise you. Join us as we explore the secrets of cultivation, unique recipes, and discover a whole new culinary world with green onions in the video below. Green onion, also known as scallions or spring onions, are an essential ingredient in many dishes around the world, especially in East Asian cuisine. In recent years, countries like China, Japan, and South Korea have emerged as major exporters of green onions, making significant contributions to the global supply chain. China alone accounts for over 70% of the world's green onion production, with thousands of hectares dedicated to cultivating this versatile crop. With such large-scale production, efficient farming methods play a crucial role in meeting the growing demand. Csic cultivation process. From seed to harvest. Green onions are easy to grow and adapt well to various farming techniques, from traditional soil planting to indoor cultivation and modern farming methods. In this video, we will introduce you to the method of growing organic green onions in a controlled environment. An advanced method that tightly controls environmental factors to ensure optimal quality and yield. The journey of the green onion begins with preparing nutrient-rich soil. The seeds carefully mix fertilisers, ensuring a balanced supply of minerals and nutrients essential for optimal growth. After preparing the soil, it is transferred to specialised machinery to automate the seed sowing process. These machines place the soil and green onion seeds into trays with precision, ensuring even distribution for uniform early growth of the plants. After planting the seeds, the trays are arranged in a tightly controlled environment, where temperature and humidity are carefully monitored, crucial factors to ensure the successful germination of the seeds. The green onions will sprout within just a few days in these ideal conditions. Water watering helps keep the soil moist without waterlogging, ensuring the roots of the plants grow healthy. As the green onions grow, they are moved to another area of the facility, where they receive ample sunlight and the appropriate temperature to support further development. This stage is crucial, as the plants will undergo photosynthesis and benefit from the stable climate, promoting healthy growth. This is the delicate balance between light, water and nutrients that allows the green onions to grow without stress. After about 70 days, the green onions will mature with tall, vibrant green leaves. At this stage, they are transferred to floating trays for hydroponic cultivation. For months of hydroponics in hydroponic farming, organic nutrients are pumped into the water, allowing plants to continue growing without the need for soil. This method not only saves space, but is also environmentally friendly, as it allows for precise control of nutrients and reduces water waste. For months of harvest, 10 days after transitioning to the hydroponic stage, the green onions will reach full maturity and be ready for harvest. Workers carefully pull each plant out of the hydroponic trays and use specialized machinery to trim any excess roots, ensuring a clean and uniform harvest. Next, the green onions are sorted and categorized by size and quality, with only the best onions selected for packaging and processing. To ensure cleanliness, the green onions are thoroughly washed under an advanced water system, removing any dirt and impurities, ensuring they meet food safety standards before distribution. From farm to table, green onion kimchi, par kimchi. For harvesting and cleaning, green onions can be used in a variety of ways. One of the most popular methods, especially in South Korea, is making par kimchi, green onion kimchi. This unique kimchi has a rich, spicy and aromatic flavor created from fresh green onions, chili powder, garlic and other spices. The process begins by neatly arranging the fresh green onions in layers to ensure the spices are evenly absorbed. A special spice mixture comprising chili powder, garlic, ginger and fish sauce is added, creating a rich and balanced flavor. Next, the green onions are carefully coated with the spice mixture, a step that requires precision to ensure uniformity. Once mixed, the green onions are packed into specialized containers to undergo natural fermentation, which can last from several days to weeks, depending on temperature and humidity conditions. During fermentation, the flavors meld together, creating a rich and flavorful side dish that pairs well with many traditional Korean meals. The final product, par kimchi, is a bold, spicy and aromatic delight that enhances any meal, especially Korean barbecue. When served with grilled pork or beef, its distinct flavors elevate the dining experience, making each bite even more delicious and satisfying. The global demand for green onions. Green onions are not only a staple in Korean cuisine, but are also widely used worldwide. As more people recognize their nutritional benefits, global demand continues to rise. Packed with vitamins A, C and K, as well as antioxidants, green onions are a nutritious choice for health conscious consumers. They support digestion, boost the immune system, and promote heart health, making them an essential part of many healthy diets. Join the farm vibes life community. Thank you for watching this video.

Welcome to Farm Vibes Life. Welcome to the next episode of our agricultural documentary series. Today, we will dive into the fascinating world of date harvesting, focusing on the use of modern shaking machines and advanced techniques in date packaging. Join us as we follow the entire journey of the Phoenix Dactylifera, also known as the date palm. This flowering plant belongs to the palm family Aricaceae and is cultivated for its delicious sweet fruit. Although its exact origin remains a mystery due to centuries of cultivation, it is believed to have originated in the regions surrounding Iraq. Date palms are now cultivated worldwide and have naturally adapted to many tropical and subtropical regions. This process begins with selecting high quality seeds or cuttings from mature trees. Offshoots are preferred because they retain the genetic characteristics of the parent tree. These offshoots are carefully planted in nutrient rich, well-prepared soil. Sandy loam soil is ideal as its good drainage is crucial for healthy root development. Date palms thrive in hot, dry climates with plenty of sunlight. They thrive in temperatures ranging from 77 degrees to 104 degrees, 25 degrees to 40 degrees. Irrigation is essential, especially during the early years. Farmers often rely on drip irrigation systems to provide consistent moisture while conserving water. In spring, date palms bloom, producing flower clusters called inflorescences from the leaf axils. There are male and female date palms. Male trees produce small, fragrant white flowers, while female trees have larger cream-coloured flowers. Pollination is key to fruit production. In nature, the wind carries pollen from male flowers to female flowers. However, to increase yield and ensure a bountiful harvest, farmers often resort to hand pollination. They collect pollen from male flowers and gently sprinkle it onto female flowers, enhancing the chances of successful fertilisation. One of the most exciting innovations in modern agriculture is the use of shaking machines for date harvesting. Previously, harvesting required workers to climb tall palm trees and pick the fruit by hand. But now, thanks to these machines, the process is faster and less labour intensive. After harvesting, the dates are transported to processing facilities for cleaning, sorting and packaging. The cleaning process involves washing the dates to remove dirt and debris. Next, they are sorted by size, colour and quality. Premium dates are then packaged using modern machinery, ensuring optimal conditions. Packaging often involves vacuum sealing or modified atmosphere packaging, or METP, to extend shelf life. An essential step for dates destined for export markets, ensuring they remain fresh during transportation. In 2023, global date exports reached a new high, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iran dominating the market. Recent statistics show that Egypt exported over 200,000 tonnes, generating significant revenue. Saudi Arabia and Iran closely followed. Each shipping approximately 150,000 tonnes. Advanced farming methods and modern technology and date cultivation and processing play a crucial role in meeting the growing global demand. Countries have invested resources in research and development to increase yield, enhance quality and promote sustainability. A persistent challenge is the demand for skilled labour. While shaking, machines and technology have reduced manual labour, trained individuals are still needed to operate equipment and manage farms efficiently. Training programs and skill-building initiatives play a crucial role in bridging this gap. Governments and agricultural agencies play a significant role in supporting the date palm industry. Policies that promote research, provide financial support and facilitate access to global markets are crucial for its growth. The future of date farming is bright, driven by continuous advancements in technology and techniques. researchers are developing new data palm varieties with better pest resistance, higher yields and adaptability to diverse climates. Data farming is a perfect blend of tradition and innovation. From planting and nurturing young palms to harvesting sweet fruits with shaking machines, each step showcases the dedication and skill of farmers. The global date market continues to expand due to the growing popularity of this fruit and improving farming efficiency.
