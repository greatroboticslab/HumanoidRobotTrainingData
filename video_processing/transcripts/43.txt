 Soybeans or edamame are one of the tastiest beans you can grow in your garden. In today's episode we will show you everything from planting soybeans and harvesting them as well as a delicious edamame recipe. So there are two ways to start soybeans. You can get seed packets from Home Depot or loaves. And sow the seeds when the weather is warm enough for soybeans to grow. Spring, Summer and Fall are the best times. Soybeans can grow very well in the summer heat here in Southern California. When starting from seeds, you can sow 6 to 8 seeds in one whiskey barrel container like you see here. The soil we have is a mix of compost, peat moss and perlite. After sowing the seeds, make sure you water well and now you are done sowing the seeds. The other way to grow soybeans is to grow it from transplants. You can buy 6 pack starter plants at your local nurseries like the one you see here and then plant them. Buying transplants for soybean saves you a lot of time growing it from seeds. Once again, we are growing this in a whiskey barrel container and we are planting 6 plants in one barrel. This container is 22 inches wide and 15 inches tall. Holds about 2.5 cubic feet of soil. Our planting mix already has a good mix of organic nutrients in the soil. We will be using an organic liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks as the plant grows as well as some worm tea. Links to all these products will be provided in the video description. Once planted, water well so that the roots can settle into their new home. Soybeans grow best in temperatures of 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. In a few weeks from planting, you can see two things. The plant has problems with both insects and diseases. Caterpillars, spider mites, they all love the soybean plant. Making growing soybeans a challenging project in your garden. And here you can see a fungal disease called rust, which the soybean plant is very prone to. It's a brown powder-like fungal disease on the plant. You can also see spider mite damage on the soybean plant in a very short span of time. So what do you do? Well, it's neem oil to the rescue. Neem oil is an insecticide to kill insects. It's a fungicide to stop rust. And it's also a miticide, which means it can stop spider mites. So a generous drenching of diluted neem oil will give some respite to these soybean plants. Spray both under and over the leaves and drench the plant completely. Repeat this weekly, till you don't see any signs of insects or diseases. And as you can see, even after the weekly neem oil applications, the rust and the spider mites have emerged stronger. The plant still has some damage due to these. However, does this really affect production? Well, we'll soon find out. Soybeans grow in full sun. So choose a nice sunny spot with at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight for your soybeans. We are transplanting 6 more soybean plants into this raised bed, which receives a lot of sunlight. And here you can see the progress after a few days. You can see that the rust and spider mites are still an issue here with these soybean plants growing on the raised bed. So it's been about 2 months since we transplanted our seedlings. And now you can see the soybeans forming pods. And within these pods are the actual soybeans or edamame. So it's the time to harvest. When harvesting, remove the entire pods. And this is how soybeans look like. They look pretty good. And I really wish these plants were a little rust resistant. But overall, for the size of the plants, we are getting a decent harvest. So what's the biggest advantage of growing soybeans at home? Well, they are non-GMO. They are much better for your health than commercially grown soybeans. And they are very delicious as well. So, to get a good harvest of soybeans, remember to fertilize your soybean plants with a good organic liquid fertilizer, as well as worm tea, for good results. And here is our harvest. As you can see, we got a lot of soybeans for the size of the plants we had. So I'm quite happy with the results. If I had grown more plants, I would have gotten more soybeans. So, the soybean plants growing in our raised beds also gave us some soybeans. But you can see the plant had no vigor, despite us providing all the nutrients, as well as protection from insects and diseases. Let's open up these soybean pods to show you how the soybean looks like inside the pods. And these are the soybeans that you can eat raw or steamed or cooked. Once the plants have completed producing their pods for harvest, you can go ahead and remove the plants. What I wanted to show you here is to pay attention to the roots. The soybean plant has roots that are relatively shallow, which means that you can grow them in shallower containers as well, like the ones smaller than the whiskey barrel containers shown here. Soybean plants fix nitrogen in the soil. They have bacteria in their roots that fix nitrogen from the air and make it available for the plant to use. Since these plants had fungal diseases like rust, I will not be composting these plants. But rather they will go into the yard waste bin. And now let's look at a delicious recipe for our harvested soybeans or edamame. We are preparing air fried edamame. First we take the soybeans whole with the pods in a bowl. Then we add in some salt. I usually use Himalayan salt. But this time I had sea salt. So that's what we'll be using. Add in a little bit of oil. Remember that very little of this oil will be actually absorbed by the edamame. But adding oil gives a very nice flavor to the pods when you're eating the edamame. And that is quite amazing. The oil also helps the salt to stick to the pods more evenly. You can skip the oil if you do not want it. You can preheat your air fryer if needed. I did not. Add the soybean pods or edamame to the air fryer. Set the air fryer to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. And cook for about 15 to 20 minutes. Tossing them around the halfway mark. Soybean dishes are actually called edamame. Because in Japanese the term edamame means stem beans. Or the preparation where beans are still attached to the pod when cooking. As you can see here the pods protect the soybeans from overcooking. And these homegrown soybeans will be one of the best tasting soybeans you will ever eat. Soybeans are packed with protein and are a very important part of a healthy vegetarian or a vegan diet. You can also steam your soybeans and add a little salt for a delicious dish. Growing soybeans is one of the best summer treats from your garden. So I highly recommend that you try growing soybeans this season. So there we have it folks. That was our episode on growing soybeans in your home garden. If you like this video give us a thumbs up.
