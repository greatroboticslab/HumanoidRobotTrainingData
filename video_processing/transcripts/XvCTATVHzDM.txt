 Sante Matunog is a 62 year old single rice farmer growing traditional variety in a hectare farm located at Barangay Bankase, Hinunangan Southern Leyte. His farm was earlier dug for treasure hunting but nothing was found. Because of his continuous learning through seminars on sustainable agriculture, he makes his land more productive and sustainable through the application of diversification and organic farming. His burning interests to make things better were simply irresistible. The challenges he faced was his area. It is flat and prone to flooding, high cost and fertilizer and pesticides, drought and unpredictable weather, and proven animal integration in the farm. As a solution, he started container gardening as climate change adaptation and mitigation, measuring floods. He locally innovates his own tea, formulated organic fertilizer and natural pesticides to improve plant vigor and effective insect repellent. He modified multi-storey cropping by placing container-based tea chai under the trellis of Opo. Then, he integrated Korean pig grazing into the farming system and used the composted beadings of the pigs as organic fertilizer. He worked hard to establish an organic farm. He established a native tilapia pond and learned that a local snail cohol constitute a nutritious feed for tilapia when mixed with rice bran. The pond water is also used for the plant plant. The pond water is also used for his farm during dry season. Planting of raw trees and legumes are used as windbreaks and as a source of grain manures. Vermicomposting as a source of organic fertilizer. Recently, the Agricultural Training Institute provide additional support like sprayer, vermicompost facility, free-range native chicken and ducks, and cross-site visits to the project's farms with similar undertakings. With his innovative concept and farming experience, his farm was transferred into a bit-sized model for all interested farmers willing to learn and adapt. He became a resource person. His income before the technology is P35,000 per year derived from rice farming alone. Now, he earned more than P80,000 per year. Organic farming takes time but with far bigger rewards. Learning doesn't stop when technology is applied. Technology adoption plus actual observations plus experience plus will to innovate equals effective location to good agricultural practices. developers remainguard� Luego, join inWoN Posso & delete-up 성ч Plus, overhead flips przacer 되면 intense singing and ASMR during vaccination stage where Hillson Page 0 1 of 8 sometimes will get available.
