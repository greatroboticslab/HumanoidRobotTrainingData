Howto & Style
 hello guys you're welcome to the channel my name is Yawasim Psechure and this is AshcoTV the official youtube channel for Asida house commodities now guess what i have always said that agribusiness is very very wide and broad now i posted a video in which i was saying that maize planting season is here talked a lot about maize farming now something you should also know is that maybe you don't want to go into the farming maybe you don't want to be a farmer right but you still want to invest in maize or in agribusiness in the direction of farming in this video i'm going to show you three very important tools that farmers really need almost every maize farmer in ghana needs this um this equipment one way or the other at least two of two out of three of them every maize farmer needs them or needs the services of these um tools okay now these are also avenues that you can go into it you can buy and rent to these farmers all right there are three that i have identified very critical ones three of them and i'm going to explain to you what the what what it does and what um you can get from it when you decide decide to invest into them get them and then render rent them out to maize farmers let's get into the video right now the first the first the first tool that i want to recommend to you that you can go into you can buy a number of them and actually rent out to farmers is maize planter yes maize planters okay now what is happening is that this maize planters they are able to help the farmer plant in straight rows okay plant in straight rows because if you look at it the the only alternative apart from using the these planters is the manual planting okay and what happens is that you're not able to get the rules very very well you're not going to get you don't get um straight rules when you use the manual you know planting but with this planters with this mechanic planters you are able to plant in straight lines and in equal distance take note of it straight line and equal distance sometimes you are able to you know plant in straight line but what about the distance mind you if you want to do maize farming and do it very well you should take all these things into consideration you should be able to plant in equal distance because this is an acre an acre has one size wherever you go now you know that you are you want to plant a certain number of um a certain number of you know plants on an acre okay if you use whatever you use this kind of mechanized you know plant is you are able to do what to determine how many plants how many missed you know plants you are going to be able to plant on an acre you know by knowing the distance between each of these um these teeth of the row of the planters all right so these planters are very necessary a lot of um farmers need them need the services of them and a lot of farmers are not able to buy them or feel relaxed reluctant buying them because maize is a seasonal crop after the season it will be ideal for the next before you know until the next season comes so most farmers are reluctant about buying them but they prefer rather renting them remember we are not going to be able to give you the price of what of these equipments these three equipments i'm talking about okay now what we can give you is how much you can rent it for so when you are able to get your price whatever you you think you can get these equipments from then you also look at you know you match it with um the the cost of renting then you'll be able to do your maths and know the profit that you can make out of you know going into investing into this particular equipment now that being said this plant is this maze planters for what i know they are rented for between 50 cities to 100 cities per acre okay 50 cities 200 cities per acre okay and then mind you this is not just one acre it is going to be you can rent it out to people who have five acres 10 acres you know they are a lot all right people who do large scale farming probably have planters you understand so the small scale farming like five acres 10 acres six acres you know 15 acres they they are they should be your target market they are the people you should be targeting all right so i can say that in a day you can rent it out for work for 20 acres and then you can do this for two 30 months you know for the first season and then maybe two three months also for the second season so just calculate this by let's say five months in the whole year then you know how much you can make in a year right owing just one of of of of these um planters all right now now the second thing i want to recommend to you the same the second equipment that i or machinery farm machinery that i want to recommend to you is me the plant you know plowing machines okay plowing machines like last um i remember last season i made a video about you know the process of um our maize farm and there were a lot of questions about you know plowing machines whenever it is mason like this plowing machines are hot kick there's no two ways about it and last season the price for a plowing machine for an acre the service of a plowing machine for an acre was 250 cities so this season you should be looking at 300 cities for one acre now once again you should be looking at um doing you know 50 at least 50 for a day if you have these services if you have a list of um farmers that that needs these services you could do 50 acres in a day just multiply by at least 250 cities per acre all right because um the more you know people gives you work i mean you you decide to you know reduce the analysis so let's let's just say minimum 150 cities by 50 city by 50 acres in a day and you can do this for like two months in a year no in the season in in the first season and two months in the second season we are talking about four months and you can do up to 50 acres per day now do your own calculations i'll just leave it for you to do your own calculations and go back to let to to see how you're going to get this this machines because we don't deal in the machines of course so get you get how to deal how to get these machines get the get the cost get do this calculation and get the possible revenue that you're going to make out of it and then strike and make the possible and get the possible profit that you can get from buying these machines all right and remind you you're not going to do it for just one year you can do this for it can be there for as many years as possible five years ten years the machine will still be there and you still be making profit out of it now surprisingly i just remembered one other machinery which a lot of people have not you know put their mind it onto a lot of people have not considered it but it is very very essential this is spraying machines spraying machines now listening in the village where we were doing our farms last season one spraying machine was 15 cities renting it for a day was 15 cities okay now i don't think this spraying machine cost more than 500 cities now this machine if well maintained you can use it for up to five years up to five years if well maintained maybe once a while you have to you know change some the some few parts of it but it can be there for a very long time now just imagine if you have 10 of them if you have 10 of them which you are going to buy for like maximum 5000 cities and you are going to rent each out for a day for for 15 cities just make it 10 cities to break into the market how much are you going to make in a month how much are you going to make in two months right and how much are you going to make if four months you're going to use it for four months in the year for both seasons of the year all right do the calculation but i tell you it is also very very profitable right now the last equipment i want to talk to you about that i want to recommend that you can go into and actually invest buy a lot of it if not one if not two you know buy a couple of them and then rent them out which is also a very very very very very hot kick of a machinery in agribusiness especially in maize farming is treasure the treasures this this is the machine that what treasure or save in the final stage of your harvest okay now these machines they are in different you know they are in different sizes and capacities but you can get some that is very very minimal that you you are you you can you know use it efficiently for like five to ten years also now they now the difference what set this um treasure machine apart from the other equipment is that for the treasure machine you can even situate it in town because come to think of it if you're looking at the maze planters if you're looking at spraying machines if you're looking at plowing machines you have to be in farming communities because you have to be close to where their lands are their farming lands are that is where you're going to get them that is where you're going to you know get to provide these services but for the treasure for the maze treasure you can bring it to town because after harvest after harvest a lot of these farmers prefer even bringing their their produce to the house and then come and you know trash it finally all right so even if you have this treasure you don't want to go to the farmland maybe some from time to time you have to go there but you can also there's also an option of keeping some in the house and then use it for the services use it to service all the farmers that prefer bringing their produce to the house all right so this is one this is another there are a lot of this equipment but this is the three four now four you know that i i wish you can also go into you could you could get few as for the spraying machine they are cheap they are cheap relatively cheap let me say it that way you know let me choose my words carefully relatively cheap we are talking about 500 cds machine that you can rent for like 60 times or 120 times in a year and you're going to charge at least 15 cds for one day you know sometimes you don't have to be a farmer to benefit from farming i hope you heard me right sometimes you don't have to be a farmer to benefit from farming you can also provide services that farmers need and also what make a business out of it right so this is ashko tv the official youtube channel for asada house
