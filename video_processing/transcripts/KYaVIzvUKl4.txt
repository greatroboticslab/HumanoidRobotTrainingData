 The firecracker chili pepper is a relatively easy plant to grow, provided you have the right conditions. Here are some steps to help you get started. Choose a location. Firecracker chili peppers need plenty of sunlight, so choose a location that gets at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. They also prefer well-drained soil with a far between 6.2 and 7.0. Start from seed. You can start your firecracker chili peppers from seed indoors about 6 to 8 weeks before the last expected frost, or you can sow them directly in the garden after all danger of frost has passed. Transplant seedlings. If you started your firecracker chili peppers from seed indoors, transplant them outside once they have at least 2 sets of true leaves and the soil has warmed up to at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Space them about 18 to 24 inches apart. Water regularly. Keep the soil moist but not warm.
