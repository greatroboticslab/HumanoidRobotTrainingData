 A flail mower is one of the most versatile tools you can own. It's one of my favorites and one of the most popular items that we sell. It can replace a finished mower and a brush hog, save you money overall, save you storage space, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The unique design of a flail mower allows you to finely cut your grass. You can maintain your lawn on a regular basis, but then you can head right out to your fields, mow your trails, mow your field, all that brush, all without making any modifications to the tool. One of the very unique things about a flail mower is the ability to offset to the side so you can get into ditches, around ponds, underneath trees, along fence rows, so you can do all the things that brush hogs and finished mowers can do, and then some. And I appreciate the compact nature of the flail mower sitting so much closer to your machine, which is beneficial whether you're on your lawn, in the woods, or in the field. Depending on the series, you'll have the ability to manually or hydraulically offset, and some of our fancier models even offer the ability to tilt. We ship flail mowers all around the country every day of the week. Get more information at goodworkstractors.com.
