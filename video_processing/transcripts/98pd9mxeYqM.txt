in peak farming the general answer to the mind of uh people that are not very much uh knowledgeable on how uh animal's laundry is being run or probably they are very much ignorant the very important answer or ignorant answer rather that many people will give you is money the answer will be money the money is what you need for you to be successful in farming in peak farming or in any other animal's boundary well as well as much as this is partially true you need money to run lots of great things on your farm but it's not absolutely true you can literally have enough money sufficient money abundant money and still not succeed in peak farming and in any other agricultural venture now the question then is what exactly do you need to succeed in peak farming what do you really need uh if money is not the answer which i can literally prove that to you because uh if you check the internet i'm sure i could probably if you need it i could probably show you the video uh snow for me for instance i i already told you guys that um uh i had i have experience when it comes to snail farming and i'll bring in videos and content on snow for me very soon and several other agricultural uh ventures because i've doubled and i've delved into several of them i was successful in almost all of them now in there's a video online that uh highlighted a farmer that spent i think about eight million or there about when i got to research on it or something about eight million in building a snail pen eight million and the farm was failing eight million nera and the farm was failing this is very clear if money was what it takes for you to uh be successful in farming or in any other animal's boundary then that guy that person should be making it because eight million is quite a number of it's it's a it's a huge amount of money now and this young man right there talking to you did not even spend i'm not sure i spent all 200 000 you know i literally if you if when i walk you through the story very soon but i remember building a small uh one of the pen for about 30 000 one of the fence i built and some other of course i built some other ones and i was making it greatly when it comes to snail farming i had lots of snails i had abundant snails it was so much that the issue was space i told you already in a previous video that the issue i always had when it comes to animal's budget in many cases was space space was the issue getting enough space to run the fan so i was able to run through snail farming without the number of cash that person had telling you already that of course i needed cash to do something that's why you can't rule out money when it comes to succeeding in animal laundry but it's not everything you need what you really need are some of the things i'll be mentioning in this video all right one of the things you need is building great relationship you need to build great relationship many of you will not understand what i'm saying until you get into it then you understand that you alone can't run it a farm is not successful on your energy your manpower alone you need people you need a great uh support system you need to have a great support system and when i say support system i don't mean people funding you money or that's not what i mean i mean support when it comes to getting your resources getting your farm resources laboring on your farm and every other thing for instance now i'm sure you have you have watched uh some of our videos when it comes to feed and everything one of the ingredients we use for our feeds on the farm right here is going from the bakery it's gotten from the bakery and uh there's a lot of competition for heat because it's not uh in abundance it's not like it's so much available or something so how are we able to get from them uh to get the waste from them it's relationship right there in the bakery i have a great relationship with somebody right there there's an importance of relationship in everything you do you may not understand until you get into it and if you don't build the right relationship it will literally affect you to affect your profits you affect your cost because what you would do for lesser amount you'll do for much more amount and i have a worker right now very faithful and very honest and the relationship i have with him is so it is so much great that i can depend on him for several activities when it comes to my farm that's some of the things you want to do you want to have great relationship with several both the people that you're getting resources from and people that are working for you want to have great relationship with them you don't want to be uh alone you can't stand alone when it comes to farming now that's just one of them some other things you need is tenacity you need tenacity you need consistency i want you to know that it's not going to be rosy all the time it's never rosy for anyone all the time there's nobody anybody that deceives you that tells you that he's having it 100 perfect when it comes to farming is lying to you it's not always rosy there are several things you're going to go through several experiences that are home for sin some things you will not even expect that even the best of the best of the best of the experienced people will still have issues with it i was i heard a farmer this farmer i'm sure when it comes to experience this farmer will draft me when it comes to experience he has been in peak family for quite a very long time now but right on this farm he had issues with uh this thing we call the soldier hands that's the i don't know if it's called so giant in every place but now these ants that are very dangerous they are they they walk in colonies and they are very they when they bombard the family bombard very in in numbers now this uh man's pig give that to i think not less and hate or eight piglets or so and these sojahans devoured all the animals they finished they literally finished all the animals they hit all the animals these are not these are not challenges that you're going to wake up and think you're going to face but obviously he faced it so you go that's why i said you need tenacity and consistency you need that strength within it's not just all about the videos you watch online you need to understand that everything you watch online is a summary of all that go that people put in when it comes to farming what you really need what really goes on they don't show you and that's what i'm telling you right here you need tenacity you're going to face challenges that it's only that resolve that resoluteness within you that's going to take you through and that's what i'm telling you right now when you're preparing to get into peak family or if you're in eat already and you're getting this core you're facing a challenge or the other all you need to do is to stay resolute keep on keeping on you don't need to back down you don't need to back down face your challenges squarely find solutions to them make the right decisions and you'll come through you'll come through you have to be decisive that's another thing you need to also have this this decisiveness it's very important for you to make the right decisions and this is why i've emphasized on you amassing knowledge consulting watching videos watch our videos watch our content you need to because those decisions you're going to make are going to be from a world of knowledge before i got into peak farming before i even doubled into big farming the knowledge i had in peak farming was so great i didn't knew so much already so before you even think about dabbling into it why don't you watch lots of videos read lots of books understand lots of things and don't focus on just the success story focus on the challenges people face try and understand the things and foresee the things have foresight on the things that you are going to face also but by the way no matter how much you watch or how much you read there's going to face things that are going to meet you on the west i want you to know that but at least you can mitigate the risk that comes with it by learning ahead so you have to be decisive you have to make the right decisions those decisions are not going to be made by other people in your farm you have to be you are this you're the owner of your farmer you have to be the one to make the right decisions so make sure you have the right knowledge that's what's going to fuel the right decisions and consult people you have to have an alliance of people and you farmers that you can easily reach out to and reach out to what's going on here what's going on there you know you need that resource you need that resource uh you need to be resourceful that's another thing you need to have you need to be very resourceful if you're going to spend money on everything you're going to run it at a loss or probably just break even you're not going to be able to make massive profit you need to be resourceful you need to be resourceful in things you do if you have the money still be resourceful it's not the money you don't need to expend the money all the time be resourceful find a way to get things done cheaper and in a much more creative way don't spend money all the time and uh last but not the least i'll be mentioning here amongst others there are others obviously to talk about but just to keep it short you have to pray for good luck you have to pray for good luck there are certain things that could happen that no matter how much you do you know there's this thing they call the swine fever so i was extremely deadly extremely deadly you have to pray and you have to hope you have to ex you have to pray for good luck you have to pray that you don't employ the farm worker that will kill all your animals those are some of the things that you don't you you you can't read in a book or watch in a video there are terrible people i've seen what farm workers do on on certain farms you have to put checks and balances on your farm workers as much as you want to if you have to run a cc or whatever you have to do i've seen farm workers that will bury eggs inside the sand of poultry farms those are farm workers if they are farm workers that would i think i've seen some that probably kill maybe these are thieves also i don't know but there are lots of things that happen what about it uh why i say you have to pray for good luck what about thieves those are things that you no matter what about thieves that connect with the security people
