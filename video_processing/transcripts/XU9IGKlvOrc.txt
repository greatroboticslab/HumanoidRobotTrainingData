 One of the first things I'd like to do is thank all our sponsors that helped us put together and provided input and money for today's event. I'm going to just read through the list. South Dakota Wheat Commission, Farm Credit Services of America, Wheat Growers, Mustang Seed, Monsanto, Prairie State Seeds, Next Level Ag LLC, Millborn Seeds, La Crosse Seeds, Dakota Best Seed, Agronomy Plus, Farmers Alliance, Mitchell, First Dakota National Bank, C&B Operations and Davidson County Implement, Scott Supply, Crop Tech, Ducks Unlimited, Aurora County Conservation District, Davidson County Conservation District, Hanson County Conservation District, South Dakota No-Till Association, SDSU Extension, USDA and NRCS, and Pioneer Hybrids and DuPont. So let's give them all a welcome runner, Morris. Anyway, you guys, without any more, this is Dwayne Beck from Dakota Electric Research. This is just how we move wire. You can see there's wire on that irrigator. These are lateral moves that move straight. We also have pivots that go around, but we just have the wire running through there and those buckets, there's a rope hanging down with a fence post on it. And those buckets give just enough weight that the fence doesn't blow and stuff like that. So that works pretty good. You do like Dan does. You get Cody to do it. Casey, you know. But these are barred JZ cattle and once we started moving, if they could hear the irrigator, you can see them. My daughter took that with her cell phone so it was the end of the sun. You can't see it so good, but terrible place to work. It's kind of like here when you look out the window. But as soon as they heard that motor, those irrigation pivot motors run, and they're just a whir, they're not very loud, but they could hear them and they'd just come at a dead run. And so we were actually moving out of corn stalks into swath grazing. I just had moved that pivot and I was in the process. And then I've got the next set will show them moving from this field into the corn stalks. So we had a time, what we did is we swath grazed between, I'll show you all the quality and stuff, but we swath grazed between this oats and pea cover crop that was growing behind winter wheat and then corn stalks. And so we balanced the diet. That thing Ken was talking about is exactly right, it's exactly the thing we do with farm ground in terms of trying to build organic matter and feed the soil microorganisms. It's exactly the same thing. And everybody wants to do turnips and radishes and clover and whatever, well that's not enough carbon. You've got too much nitrogen and you just burn it up. And you've got to have the balanced diet. Now here the cows are moving. We'd move this lateral move down here. They're moving. You'll notice if you look closely, they mostly have collars on and they have little Fitbits on their feet. And what those collars do is tell you how much their head is moving up and down and eating and then the Fitbit tells you how many steps. And to be real honest with you, I haven't analyzed all that data yet because there's just a mountain of data that we've got to take care of. So this big draw here, there's some tall grass prairie there and there's a big draw there with tall grass prairie. That's our area that they could get into when it got cold and crappy and that's something you've got to think about is windbreaks and stuff. And so we had that Christmas blizzard. That's what happened. Now I moved the pivot again. And you watch them coming from back over here at a dead run down to this pivot. So they really like the swathed oats, pea stuff because that was the candy. But you also have to, it's like we were joking here, everybody's coming over and getting rolls, right? It's a bit too much carbohydrate. And those of you that had hamburgers, you got a chance because you had your protein, right? But I'm not sure, you might have to eat another steak before you leave here if you eat too damn anymore. So, Dakota Lakes Research Farm is owned by farmers. And actually the idea for Dakota Lakes started at the old steakhouse. Down over the hill one night after a field day in the 80s. And some guys said, well, we should have a research farm. And I just said, you don't want the government to own it. You want to own it yourself. Because the government owns it, you can never tell what's going to happen. And you've got to have the government involved, and that's me, to a certain extent, working for SDSU. But we have to have the farmers own it. And Dan is actually our president now. So, our board of directors is important to us. I'm just going to be real brief today. The climate will change. But it will still be a continental climate. We'll still have cold winters here. Relatively cold winters. Cold and dry, normally winters. We'll have hot and dry summers. That's not going to change. Now, it's going to change a bit. But we're still going to be a continental climate. We're not going to turn into a California or a Florida. A bigger issue, though, and at least in your lifetimes in the next 600 years or something, which is beyond our lifetime, degradation of the ecosystem will have more potential impact. And I just wrote one of those articles for Farm Journal that at one time we had the Cronins involved in. And now I've got a guy from Nebraska that I'm working with. But I talked about that, and especially as you said, along the Missouri River here. And one of the things I think about is all the people used to travel up and down this river and think of what they found when they came through here and how is it different now from when it was when they came in 400 or 500 years or when Lewis and Clark came through. And it wasn't like what the Revenant showed, by the way. That was supposed to be here, but we don't have the big forests and stuff. We didn't have that much climate change in the last 200 years. But anyway, what we've done is we took the land around Gettysburg and we took the organic matter down to half of what it was when we came here. And so it didn't hold as much water, and it wasn't as resilient as it should have been. And so when I taught school here in 1975 through 1978, which some of you didn't know, but a lot of you did. She was a student. Not one of mine, but she was a student. And she's like a freshman when I left. But we had dirt blown over the road all time. And we could only do wheat and summer fowl. And look at what's different now. And it's because we started to restore that soil to where it should be. And it holds more organic matter than it did in 1976 and not as much as it did in 1776. So this is a thing we need to look at. And that's the thing we talk about. And cattle, I think, integration plays a role in that. Ecosystems harvest sunlight, energy, and drive all other processes. Removing the products from the ecosystem reduces the energy available. One of the worst things you can do is make hay on a piece of ground and haul the hay off and not bring anything back. It's one of the worst things you can do to an ecosystem. And so our north unit, if you're familiar with our farm, we've got a half section, a big half section plus a 40, five miles north. And it had been hayland for a guy from the 1930s on. Incredibly degraded ecosystem. And we bought it in 2000, and now we've got it somewhat restored. At least it's way better than what it was when we took over. It's better than the neighbor's pasture that's overgrazed. Right? Before it probably wasn't. Nutrients. Are all the nutrients available for plant use or environmental services, or have they been leached, eroded, or transported from the landscape? If you've got saline seeps and those kind of things, it's because your nutrients are leaving where they belong and going someplace else. That's fertilizer in those saline seeps. And we're going to eventually have to put perennial systems back in there to suck up those nutrients and big them back to the top. And then graze them and put them back into place. That's what happened in the native prairie. Cover crops will help us balance our water cycle a little better, but they won't totally do it on their own. Ecosystems that leak nutrients turn into deserts. That's what's happened in North Africa and all these places. Think about Israel. The land of milk and honey. Climate hasn't changed that much in the intervening years. What happened is they degraded the ecosystem. And you can read a thing that a guy by the name of Laudermilk wrote in the 1930s. It's just phenomenal what he found when he went to Israel and looked at what the soils are and what they should have been. We're doing the same thing. A 120-car train of soybeans contains 400,000 pounds of phosphorus. Think of how many unit trains go out of Selby and all these little circle tracks here and there and across the United States and they're all going someplace like China. They're not going to send that phosphorus back to us. So we're mining. When we're doing that, we're mining. We're not farming. We're mining. We're taking the nutrients out and sending them across the road. February 20th, last Saturday, or last something like that, it cost $2.25 a bushel to ship corn, bushel of corn, to the West Coast. From Aberdeen. I had an elevator manager from Aberdeen talking to me on the phone and he says it cost me $2.25 a bushel to ship my corn to the West Coast. Does that make any damn sense? Right? It doesn't make any sense to me. I'm going, why the hell are we doing this? And then they're going to feed animals over there with it and then the phosphorus is there. So we're spending that kind of money and then we're sending the phosphorus with it. Coal train contains 7,200 tons of coal but when you're digging up coal, you're admitting to be a miner. That's what you do. You take an oil out. You're a miner. You know you're going to take it and it's just going to be gone. But when we started farming and organic matter went down, it was the same thing. We took the organic matter out and gassed it off. Right? And it would take at least one coal train per half section just for the top six inches of rain. I mean the top six inches of soil to take all the organic matter that we lost just out of the top six inches. One coal train per half section. So if we're going to restore 2% in that top six inches if we're going to do that down to two or three foot just think how many train loads of coal we'd have to bring back in. It's amazing. So we're partially using cover crops to a large extent to catch carbon in the air and put it in the soil. One of the things I talk a lot and Danny's heard me do this but when you ship out oil we're working with cold pressing sunflowers and soybeans and flax and whatever and we cold press it, we get the oil out of it we got good meal. I gave Don a bucket of soybean meal that we use for a protein supplement. The stuff that's left when we press the oil out and now when we ship the oil out all we've shipped out is carbon dioxide and water. There's no minerals in there. And Mother Nature brings you back water she brings you back carbon dioxide in the air and if we do it right she brings you back nitrogen in the air. We're not transporting anything. Now if we use those things here and keep all the minerals here then we cut down this big transportation thing in 600 years or 200 years or 100 years this transportation thing is just going to get a bigger and bigger and bigger problem. So there's our catching the nitrogen we call this catch and release nutrients. I stole that from a guy in North Dakota. I got another one from Jay Fuhrer the other day. I didn't put it in but he said a light bulb did not result from somebody incrementally trying to make candles better. Right? We got to start thinking different. Instead of just keep trying to do what we're doing and do it a little bit better we'll still have a damn candle. So 1970 the average wheat price was $1.37 a bushel. The average price of barrel oil was $3.39. Price of barrel oil today is just south of 60 bucks. And wheat's about 3.5 or 4. Think about that. 80%. 80% of the total input cost in agriculture can be traced directly to energy. So incrementally trying to do better and better and still relying on all this energy doesn't make any sense because we're losing. Oil's going up faster. 120 years ago we essentially were zero. Don brought his dad down. John. He's 103. And he looked at the cows. You remember what he said? He said they're eating the swaths and he says well they're bailing they're hauling the bales and they're hauling the manure back out. Right? I'm going yeah. That's it. I thought that was pretty good. I thought he got the essence of the whole thing right there. 120 years ago that was zero. 120 years from now we're going to have to be zero again. Right? Now today we're talking about grazing. Why? Elvin Savory's been mentioned a few times and he talked about brittle environments or dry climates. Right? Well he's saying it's a hoof action. I think it's also in dry climate soil biology slows or stops during periods of low moisture. The rumen of grazing animals remains moist and continuing those biological processes. the processes in the soil are almost exactly the same as the process in the rumen. It's almost no different. And somebody said and I thought it was Darwin but I can't find the the quote but somebody called the soil the rumen of the earth. And if you know who that was Cody you would That was me. That was you that did that. That was after you left the school of mines. Right? Okay. But but that's the idea behind grazing animals being important in dry climates or relatively more important in dry climates. In cold climates the same thing. Soil biology slows during times of low soil moisture or low soil temperatures. The rumen of grazing animals are always warm. They keep it going during the winter. That's the role. We're cycling it. We're not getting rid of the organic matter. We're cycling it. Okay? So here's some of our cover crops. That would be our oats and pea thing. We swath it. The swaths have to be relatively big so they don't get covered up with snow. The Canadians are not worried about snow depth. You know those cows will go out there in really deep snow if they can see it. They will drive on it if it gets to be hard snow they'll just drive a tractor on it. Or a pickup and just to break the snow. But we had some pretty deep snow and it didn't seem to bother the cows a bit. That's what it looks like in the fall. You know nice and green in there. It stayed green like that until basically we were done grazing. Until it was all gone. We had a couple fields where we had oats, peas and rapeseed. Winter wheat stubble was going to be seeded to corn in 2017. In this field in particular we had 7,700 pounds of biomass per acre 18.2% protein and 121 relative feed value. 03 which was that pivot you saw a little bit less biomass not a lot 17.4% protein 150 now since Ken was here you saw me goofing with the computer because I went back and got some he started using something I didn't have on there so he was using TDN so our TDN was 72% on these oat pea rapeseed things protein 17.4 that ratio is 4 to 1 so it's too hot if all we did is graze that that's not that's too hot we're just going to waste it it's like you guys eating nothing but steak you need to have some carbohydrate to go with it so we were grazing these swaths at the same time we were allowing the cows to have access to corn stalks not corn but corn stalks after harvest and that's how we balanced the diet and so one of the things if you're planning to do cover crops it'd be good to plan to have some source of corn stalks or perennial pastures or something like that you could use for your filler so to speak instead of and that's what we did we could vary the moves to make them go to the corn stalks and get full instead of just eat the oats so this is the reason for grazing the material and associating with low quality corn stalk aftermath at the end of the grazing period mid-January when Don come and got the cows we had a few swaths left and went and pulled a sample out of those last swaths 16.8 still 16.8 versus just 17 something TDN of 65.1 and still had a relative fee value of 95 so we lost a little bit of quality but not very dang much in that period so I'm fairly confident in the east here now if I lived I grew up in Platt which is just west of Corsica so you know in that area a little bit more fall rains and stuff it might be a bit different but in this country I'm not afraid of that thing at all so what we did here's a rope coming down from the irrigators that bucket there's two wires one here and here and yeah we should have had a third when it gets really iced up you should have that ground in the middle and so we had a couple cows I can give you the numbers that you'd move them back through the fence and they turn around and come right back through they go screw you I know this thing isn't going to hurt me because it's icy now here I'm moving I said we should be moving perpendicular the swaths we just couldn't arrange it to do that this year the way we had things set up so we're moving like Larry was parallel to the swaths and it's not ideal but we didn't we didn't have we were done with this field before we had snow so we moved about every day and a half we gave them two swaths or 60 feet and you can kind of see this these are where the moves before we didn't have a back fence here we had water on this road and then there's corn stalks on the other side of the road but then about every five or six days we would throw back fence in or some side fence so they couldn't get back and just loaf around back over here but they didn't spend a lot of time back there they cleaned up pretty well and you can see down through there the wheat stubble this is 120 bushel wheat stubble underneath this is the this is the stubble from the oats and they left the stubble they ate the swath they left the stubble there's and then we had all the stuff from the crop that we'd harvested laying down in there so there's good armor there and you can see it's high quality stuff and we did fecal sample and they haven't gotten those back yet but we did fecal sample on a regular basis and we we thought that worked pretty good last year when we did study to tell us if we're getting a little low in protein there it's coming through corn stalks on wheat stubble that would be seeded to soybeans we put in oats German millet brown midrib sorghum sedan and somebody talked about this not quite as much biomass because it didn't grow into that late fall this year you know that forage sorghum stuff quits relatively early protein's a little lower relative fee value is pretty good that's what it looked like where the hay mill is just starting to head out oats is coming up through there that's what it looked like in the swath this is actually from a year ago I took these and there we had the swaths running this way and we were moving the fence perpendicular to the swaths and they would and we had quite a bit of snow a year ago and they would just follow that swath just fine see and you can't see where that swath is but it's there but that tells them there's a swath there and as soon as you move that wire they'll just come to those spots and there's like 12 or 15 of them and the way they'd go we like bigger buckets better than the small buckets the 5 gallon buckets work better actually so there's so these were barge AZ cattle mature cows various genetics you can ask Don about that late second trimester and we had a few opens in there 60 day grazing period initial weight of 1,392 pounds final weight of 1,449 47 pound gain so I did that wrong 57 pound gain typo typo and you look at that no they gain more than that and there was a few that didn't gain a couple of them lost some weight and there's some that did way better than the others which is kind of interesting but we did a 60 days 47 acres of oat pea and 6 acres of that millet stuff and then 75 acres of corn stalk swathed oat pea we shot for a grazing or what we had was a grazing intensity of 5 AUM per acre on those cover crops the high quality stuff and then since we had more acres of corn stalks now we were doing these at the same time so the average was about a 2 is really what you get out of that if you do it and we just give them mineral and salt at lib you can't possibly write this down in time but they're going to have a copy but all I did is you just google swath grazing Alberta and you'll get this now the government of Saskatchewan and Alberta and Manitoba have worked on swath grazing since I've been married and we've been married 29 years and we ran into this then and one of the reasons they really did a lot of this especially in the interim is mad cow disease because if you lived in Canada and you're a cow calf guy 15 years ago an old cow killer cow was worth 7 cents American so you got to take something out of your system in order to be profitable or you got to get out of the business and this is one way they did it and they did this couple of these large studies somebody showed something from University of Brandon or whatever it was actually Ag Canada Brandon was one of the stations and they took a 600 cow herd and split it into three herds at 200 one set stayed in the feedlot all year one set feedlot in the winter and they went out into perennial pastures in the summer the other set of 200 just was in fields grazing annual crops in production fields the one that performed the best they went in for five or six weeks and calved them they went into the buildings but other than that they were out doing their thing and the best herd health the best performance the best whatever was the ones that were out the new manager the Ag Research Center in Rapid City the western campus of SDSU so to speak the livestock people were Ken works the new person there they were interviewing for that position I was on the committee and came down to the last two and I asked both of them the question do you think there'll be feed lots in 40 years you know what a curveball right if you're somebody applying for a job and some guy asked you that question but one of them answered the one that actually got the job immediately said no and and then the follow up question is how do you change the way you do ag research in western south dakota to get ready for the eventuality of not having calves go right to feed lots now why don't why why do I think there probably won't be feed lots in 40 years 60 years whatever because you've got antibiotic resistance you've got huge problems with energy to take you know take do silage I don't know what your silage cutting costs Danny a lot I mean that's the way you say that and bailing and hauling and whatever and then you have to try to haul the nutrients back out and we saw the day to day already that if that cow pees in a feed lot versus peeing out in the field it's a huge difference in terms of nitrogen it's a huge difference in terms of phosphorus cycling so we really don't have a choice we need to get them back out in the field I mean it's not one of those things like we have a choice it's one of these things that we're going to be forced to do it eventually so we're better off to do it when we start so this is a good place these are really interesting videos and Raleigh Leesman who isn't here but I hope to bring him today but he's heading Sioux Falls for the wrestling tournament his son's in the wrestling tournament and he didn't want to get stuck not being there but he wintered 400 head of cows on 370 acres of corn failed corn this year he wintered 400 acres of cows on 370 acres of failed corn he had 370 acres of failed corn north of Blunt some gravelly ground got dry and he wintered his whole herd there I said well you know he was just and I said why the hell didn't you put your cows in there you know I told him to build fences and stuff he didn't necessarily do that but he's they're still there and he said it's the most money he ever made to grow corn and it failed he got his insurance payment right plus he grazed all these cows he hasn't fed any hay or any silage all year so and he got I sent him this link and then I started getting texts last night he was watching these videos he sent me all these texts and commenting and whatever and I'm going okay this picture was taken just on the outskirts of Lloydminster Saskatchewan about 12 years ago Lloydminster Saskatchewan is right straight east of Edmonton long ways north right long ways north long ways north of the border probably four or five hours north of the border right on the Alberta Saskatchewan border the border of Alberta and Saskatchewan goes right through the middle of Lloydminster so it's kind of like pier fort pier only there's not a river there there's just a line just like a little sign they have been doing this for a long time they grow corn just to graze okay now more goats more cows more sheep why you say goats number one meat eaten in the world is goat just so you cowboys don't get too arrogant in Africa all the little girls take care of the goats right 100% grass fed ground beef this was produced in Aberdeen South Dakota by cull cows in Montana bring them to Aberdeen feed them on cover crops and they're grass fed because they haven't had grain interesting concept four bucks a pound the world supply of mineable phosphorus will be exhausted in less than 120 years and the people that have the mineable phosphorus are not our friends probably even more so now use of perennial sequences of perennial cover crops will probably be necessary to get our nutrient cycling right mother nature does not do tillage unless it's a catastrophic event and she does not export nutrients okay all tillage tools destroy soil structure all tillage tools decrease water infiltration all tillage tools reduce organic matter and all tillage tools increase weeds and in central south Dakota we all know this I'm heading to Missouri next week they don't know this they're really slow learners in Missouri mother nature does not care what was that show me yeah show me right she does not care which species survive or die right we don't have to do this to save the planet the planet will be fine without us but it will probably be without us unless we do something different bureaucracies like universities governments and corporations are operated by people with limited tenure some with shorter tenure than others especially whatever that joke worked better last week they have short term goals right they're just thinking about three four years and society landowners farmers you know family farmers we need to have long term research and that's what Dakota Lakes does farmers and ranchers harvest sunlight carbon dioxide and water produce products we can sell doesn't make any difference some of this is human food so we need to be aware of nutritional issue and offsite impacts if we want to eat meat maybe we should concentrate on growing meat instead of corn and barley that goes to feedlot and feeds animals you know doesn't make any sense peak oil is when you're half done with oil production in the world peak phosphorus we're hit both peak oil and peak phosphorus already peak soil when half the soil is screwed up we're probably past that you know nobody nobody is panicked other than me take the E out of ET take the T out of can't and remember that doing the right thing environmentally is almost always the correct economic approach in the long run think about that one so there and it's supposed to be snowing by now Danny I figured does everybody be heading for the door so I made it really short
