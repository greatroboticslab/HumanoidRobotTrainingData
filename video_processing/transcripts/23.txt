 Okay, today we're going to plant some corn. We're using a horse-drawn 999L corn planter. And the method we're going to use is called check row planting. We're going to check our corn, which means that we have our planter set at 36 inch rows. And we'll be using a check wire, which is this here, we'll explain a little bit later. And every 36 inches, it'll drop anywhere from two to four kernels, depending on how we set it. So we'll have hills of corn every 36 inches. And when we're done with this planting, this entire field will be on a 36 inch grid. And it's an old method of the way they used to plant corn before they had sprays and stuff for weeds. You'll be able to cultivate the corn the way you've rose, the way we planted it. You'll be able to turn 90 degrees and cultivate your corn crossways because your rows will be, everything is on 36 inch. And that'll help. You'll just have a little column of weeds left around the four plants. Okay. So the way we achieve this is they've got a wire. We're going to roll the wire out first. That's the first thing you do. We're not going to plant any corn. And every 36 inches, there's a knot on this wire. And the wire runs on the planter. And it'll trip the seed boxes with four kernels every 36 inches. And we'll show you how that's going to work, how that works. But first you have to anchor it. You've got to have an anchor for your wire. And we laid out a straight line. You want one line on your edge of your field to be straight. So everything, as you advance across the field, everything is in line. So they've got some stakes and you press them into the ground to anchor your wire. And then we'll take off and unroll the wire to the other end of the field. I'm not sure, but I think most of these spools had about a quarter mile of wire on them. And when we get to the other end of the field, the roll will unhook from the planter. We'll leave it on that end of the field with another anchor and come back. And then we'll hook the wire onto the planter and start the process of planting some corn. Today we're going to use a jaw-and-ear tractor to pull the planter. The planter originally was made for horses, as you can see. It's not a way to hurt for the double tree. But we can keep the rows much straighter with the tractor. And when the wire is running alongside, the wire runs right alongside of the horses when they're walking, and it's jumping up and down and moving all around. And if the horses aren't used to it, they could get a little excited. They think it's a great big snake coming after them. So we are going to use the tractor today. Okay, we're at the end of the field now. So we're going to remove the roll of wire. Take it off. Bring the remaining valve. Set it all the way up here against the rod of the way. We'll have to move the wire reel with the stake. Each time we move the stake, we'll have to move the wire. Now here's the other anchor stake. Grab one. Right here there's a little hook on this stake. Grab that wire. And then you pull it tight. I'll go back one more. Push it into the ground. Get a good anchor. And that's it. We'll just go back to the other end of the field. And hook the wire up to the planter and start planting. Okay, we're back down at the end of the field and ready to start. We'll hook up the wire first. We have a little trip mechanism here. And you grab your check wire. And you bring it up here. And there's a little deal here that this is what catches the knots as you go. You get it up on top of these rollers. And then you bring it up. And it latches in here. And runs through these roller guides, the wire. And every time it gets to a knot, it'll trip this lever right there. And it'll drop four kernels of corn and make a hill. So that's how it works. As you go along, it'll click, click. It'll be tripping. Next thing you need to do is set your roll markers. So you can see that way to follow on the way back. And then you can see that. You can see that way. I'm going to make a groove in there. And I'll put the center of the tractor tire right on that groove as we come back. And you should have nice straight rows. The other thing we got to do is lower the shoes down into the ground. And now it'll be engaged in gear and start the plant. All right. We made it to the end of the field. Now, there's a little release right there. We'll step on that with the foot. That'll release the wire. The wire will fall off. Usually falls off on its own. We'll turn around and reset to go back. And then we have to move the wire stake over. We'll show you how that is as soon as I get turned around. Okay, we're turned around. And now we have to reset our anchor on this end. And that's when you, every time you get to the end, you got to move your wire over. When we get down to the other end, we'll have to do the same medical thing. We'll move it over. Pull up the stake. Pull the wire tight. Pull it over. And line up with the center of your tractor or the seat on your planter. And re-push it into the ground. Okay, and you pick up your wire. Put it in the little tripping mechanism there. Lower your planter down into the planting position. And you're good to go. Okay, we're back down to the end of the field again, where we started at. So now we have to move our wire over again. All right, we got the field all planted. We're all done. Now the next thing to do is to roll the wire back up. What you do is take and start your roll, get it, roll the access up to the back of the machine. You got to drive over the top of the wire all the way back. All right, put it underneath. Set it up in there. Like that. Okay. And then we got a little clutch assembly here. We'll tighten that up a little bit. And then we have a dog here on this gear that we're going to have to do. Now we should be able to take this at the top of its break. Now we're the new gear. Great. We're going to make it easy to set the grease up to fix the net down into the back and front. Camera, that might be okay. Yeah, this is on the back, so it covers these that we'll have to pull it on. And I hope to check that the governance between the guys kingdom and the guys. this gear that we flip up to engage it. Now we should be able to just drive along and it'll... oh wait we gotta... there should be a... a little cone affair right here with the wire in. I'm gonna take it out of here. Got a little bit underneath the tractor. We need to wind up yet. Do that by hand by turning it by hand. I'm glad we don't have to do the whole field like this. Okay there it is we're all done ready to head to the next field. We got this field of Minnesota 13 all planted. We'll later on when it comes up show you what it looks like and how to cultivate it. We'll later on show you it again. Open the split we could, With that neste scene. Open your ears to make sure that this vehicle is in ME Northwestern. Open your ears to come to know my ears to act. You can just send your eyes to HP and call that rifle dart- AZP. You can absolutely see what I'm gonna shoot. It'd be apparent that our team runs on a CAR or US 70C. So it might be removed. You can see the threshold work on man basis. The NFL still looksかな. It does提ellen something. You still don't know what it looks like.
