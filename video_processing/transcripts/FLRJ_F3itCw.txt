 Today I'm going to demonstrate a simple way to attach drip tape to a header pipe and to plug the end of the drip tape. The first thing that you will want to do to attach the lay flat to the header pipe is attach the drip tape to the fitting. Twisting the fitting to the right with tightness so that it won't come off when you turn the water on. Then take a Phillips head screwdriver and punch a hole in the lay flat header. We are doing this part with the water on. It makes it easier to punch the hole, but you will get wet. Be careful to use a screwdriver with a head that is slightly smaller than the fitting so that it doesn't leak around the fitting. Then push the fitting into the hole. You should be able to hear or feel a pop when the fitting slides into the hole. With the water on, it will flow through the tape and out the other end if you haven't plugged it yet. To plug the tape, make sure the water is cut off. Cut off a 1-2 inch piece from the end. Fold the tape over twice, then in half so that it will easily slip inside the piece you have cut off. Now your drip tape is ready to go. To ensure it stays in place, turn the water on and get all the kinks out so the water is flowing to the end of the drip tape. And you have it placed where you want it. Then, take a regular garden hole and place soil every foot or so on top of the drip tape to weigh it down so that it won't get displaced by high wind. Be careful not to hit the tape with the hole. You will be able to apply water directly to the plant without getting the plant or fruit wet. This is a great way to conserve water, reduce plant disease spread, and reduce food safety risk. We hope this video was very useful.
