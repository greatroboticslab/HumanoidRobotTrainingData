 Harvest season is here, and it's time to gather the bountiful peanuts from our orchards. Join us on this journey as we take you through the process of bringing these delicious fruits to the market. First, let's head to the peanut fields. As the sun rises, farmers begin their day, carefully inspecting the plants and selecting the ripest peanuts. With skilled hands, they gently pull the plants from the ground, revealing the hidden treasures beneath the soil. Next, the peanuts are taken to the drying facility. Here, they are spread out on large trays and left to dry under the warm sun. This process ensures that the peanuts are perfectly roasted and ready for consumption. Meanwhile, in the peach orchards, the trees are heavy with ripe, luscious fruits. Farmers carefully pluck each peach, making sure to handle them with care to avoid any bruising. The sweet aroma fills the air as the baskets fill up with these vibrant, juicy peaches. Once the harvest is complete, it's time to prepare for the market.
