 Do you know much about the water or do you know much about the farm itself? It's usually on a river. Somewhere like a fresh water. It's definitely coming up to have a river so far. Not so much like a fish or when they actually like the idea is to take the sturgeon. And to like get the eggs out of them without destroying their lives. They don't kill the fish.

But they will do their best to leave the fish back and hopefully able to reproduce. So Northern Devine is like a sustainable harvest. Yeah. It's definitely a small egg. It's up to the dollar. As far as we know.
