it on we got 100 power right here just unplug that guy that's going out with us now if i can just remember what i did sun's really bright today if i can remember what i did with my battery charger i've got a hundred of them but one works best it works better than all the rest and it's just a little cheapy here it is so i've got it over here keeping the ventrac battery topped off we'll be mowing here pretty soon there we go unplug responsibly we'll see what this is for in just a second all right stay i know there's something else i needed but i can't remember what it is you know how that is there's something else i needed from in here and i'll remember it about the time i get over to the cows hmm well let's just give you a quick shop tour while we're in here this is a mess this is my shop and it's a total absolute disaster of a mess it won't be that way for long and if you guys follow the channel this might be interesting to you this is where i do some of my videos right here and we've got lighting lighting lighting uh and this mount right here which holds a microphone and a camera and then we've got a table right here where we do a lot of work so i rebuilt the chainsaw on that table and i do a lot of stuff like that that's what i need to do i got a chainsaw scenario going on out here i'm going to grab me a pair of gloves gloves and we're going to go out to the outdoor kitchen this is the outdoor kitchen from carolina barn builders awesome awesome outdoor kitchen that's called a gather grill i'll post a link this is the coolest grill i've ever seen underneath here we got a griddle and a grate and you build a fire and this thing rotates around so it's like a lazy susan it's patio furniture and it's a grill it's expensive and it's worth it i did a chainsaw video out here gosh months ago and the chainsaw has been sitting here ever since so let's put the chainsaw back together real quick this is that tool that i just brought in it's called a ratchet scrunch it's a ratcheting scrunch chainsaw tool really cool i was out here working on chainsaws trying to get everything ready for winter and like i said it's been several months uh since i was out here got a big gooey ooey gooey mess every chainsaw leaks bar oil if you guys know a secret to make them not leak let me know it's just every chainsaw i have this is a husqabana 460 rancher the first chainsaw i bought when i bought the farm ouch good good and let's make sure this puppy fires up good pull our choke chain brake contact oh come on oh right almost all i need to see now put our scabbard on grab all of our tools you guys hear the cows mooing i can hear them it's like your babies crying you can hear them even in your sleep if you raise animals like this we got to get over there and take care of those uh moo cows let's put this in here oh the rest of the saws that's my chainsaw toolbox i will get to that later i'm gonna clean the grease off this table too tubble towels good for everything this thing is gross now you gonna use tub of towels you just ain't living right the cows are over there mooing and it makes me very suspect that something is wrong like jumper has jumped the fence

jesse's pretty cool 1967 ford dump truck gonna be working on this guy very soon it runs like a top but it's got flats flat tires everywhere one of the most handy tools i've ever had on this farm and any piece of property needs this uh this is a milwaukee tire pump i put this extra accessory on here i'll post a link for you guys in the video description we'll get this guy up and rolling simply put it on there and you can set it and forget it so i want to turn it on i have a memory i've set set it at 40 psi that's it set it forget it walk away when we get back my tire will be up unless it's off the rim this is george george has got a battery issue let me show you real quick george's battery is dead as a doornail that's how we call it here in the southern regions of the united states reason he's dead is because i left a switch on thanks josh good job make more work for yourself i already got the hood up and i tried to jump this off with a jump box the other day the battery was too dead to jump with a jump box so this is the solution and it's really cool this is a power station portable battery bank i will post a link to it it's the elite 200 and all i do is take my battery charger set it right up here so i plug it in and then i hook it up and it'll charge this car battery all the way back up to full charge with fingers crossed i didn't destroy the battery plug it in negative positive power on 99 ac power on you're hooked up to our battery we have 1.6 volts put that thing on the slow charge all right bring our hood down put this food over here it looks like buddy's having a little bit of a fun time lounging what are you doing friend hey boy what you doing friends come on let's go come on go to your bed go to your bed little boy he's getting up the stairs pretty good today good job good job i'm so proud of you it's steaks falling out good deal can you believe it's almost been an hour already we just burn burn burn burn through time here on the farm pretty crazy we're gonna hop on the blue becon head over to the cows and see why they're so upset they are not happy campers right now yep content clear prop yep you charge now oh hard left clyde hard left really windy over here looks like i've got a mineral block already out in this little pasture we'll scoop it up and take it to the cows they are probably bawling because they want their minerals there we go cows are all right there now there's buzzards in the air above the cows this means there could be a situation with a pregnant cow huh let's see hey bud hey big bud uh-oh four-wheeler there we go hey big bud you okay this morning huh you okay good boy good boy all right you want to try this we'll try some salt block or you want to butt it you want to butt it with your head or you want to try it we'll chuck that out there this is the one that's balling that's cindy i don't know why she's crying but she's just gonna have to cry every day i roll out hay to the cows today they get an afternoon bale tomorrow they get a bale in the morning and in the evening so we're stretching out three bales over two days they get a bale and a half every day that's how it works and they're ready you guys hungry dude that cow is peeing and the wind's blowing so hard to pee blew and hit me in the face yuck le pew le pew the farm runs on atvs low pressure talk about that in a second this is a greg judy balen roller greenpasturesfarm.net you guys are greg judy fans tell them you saw me talking about them on stony ridge all right we're gonna back up we'll hook up to this hay bale all right all right gosh that cindy is really fussy over there she's normally not like that oh it's a tight squeeze i'm too fat here we go sometimes the hay bale sticks to the ground pretty good raises the four-wheeler up off the ground a little bit timber you de vencer come on little girls come on little girls come on kids come on kiddos this is called net wrap these are all net wrapped bales they keep better outdoors than a twine wrapped bale ok take the net wrap off cows can get that in their stomach we have to be careful not letting them get any in their stomach make them sick could kill them shake it up stuff it on the four wheeler unhook the great duty balen roller take my arm tip it up and we unroll you kids ready for some snacks hey butthead how are you this morning oh good girl do that song hawaii That's how we unload the hay to the cows. Pretty simple, takes about 10 minutes a day. Keeping 50 cows like this, and it's around about 50, typically takes me somewhere between 30 minutes to an hour a day, depending on whether I film a live stream. Now typically I'll hook up to another bale, but today we're running and gunning, we've got work to do, so we're going to leave it alone and get it in the morning first thing, 7am. Oh, that's good, that's a good workout. 10 wraps. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. We're ready for the next bale. Now, if you want real farm chores, if you want real world, I pick up 10 rocks a day. Every day, no matter what. Every day, at least 10 rocks on the farm. So we're on a quick rock hunting journey. You'll see I've got some rocks here. We're going to toss those in a gully in a second. All right. All right. Here we go. One. Come on. Come on, here. Two, three. Four, five. Six, seven, eight. Nine, ten, eleven. Overachiever award right here. I get my gold star today. Let's take them and chuck them over in the ditch. Good cows. Good cows. Oh, come on. Come on, here. Two, three. Two, three. Four, five. Six, seven, eight. Nine, ten, eleven. Overachiever award right here. I get my gold star today. Let's take them and chuck them over in the ditch. Good cows. Good girls and boys. Quick head count. We got ten babies. I counted them. There's Tammy. Wait a minute. Another bonus rock. Hot dog. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, man. That was a miss. This is my video game for the day, right? Some people are gamers. I'm just a rock picker-upper. You see all the hay that's scattered out on the land right here along with a lot of manure on the land. What this does is allows us to farm regeneratively, okay? There's hay all down through here in gullies and ditches and on the top of the hill. Think about it. Okay, we're putting the hay up on the top of the hill. The cows eat on the top of the hill. The cows eat on the top of the hill. They poop eat on the top of the hill. And it rains and the nutrients wash down the hill. Isn't that cool? There's a lot of knowing and doing and smertings going on. These are remnants over in here. You see a bunch of rocks. That's remnants from an old tobacco barn that used to be right here. And simply going to pull right up here. Shut her down, Beaufort. We're going to chuck these rocks over in that there ditch. We keep chucking rocks in the ditch. The rain comes in. We get a little erosion. The dirt catches. Next thing you know that ditch is a flat spot. We got more pasture. Hey Stony Ridge Farmer, don't you have a rock picker? How come you ain't using a machine to pick those rocks up? I came right around here all day picking up little bitty rocks with a machine. There's not a machine for everything on the farm. That's a common misconception. These mega farms make folks think that everything's done from the seat of a tractor. And it's just not the case on a small farm. Guys, share your stories with me. It's not the case. Took my electric fence back. That's my fence charger. This is pretty cool. Check it out. I'm going to have links to this soon. This is an electric fence monitor from SensorTech. Guys, awesome. I can tell every day, every morning when my fence is working and when it's not working. And actually, that setup right there shuts itself down at about midnight and starts back up at sunrise every morning. I had no idea until last night. This is the first day trying that new sensor. Way cool. Let's get back on the BluvaCon. We're going to go back and we'll move the tire pump to another tire. Those two blue balls that you see floating right there, those two little blue things, that tells me my water system is working properly. We're also checking the water system over on the other side where the cows were, too. cows were too. As long as those two blue balls are sticking up like they should be, then we know the water system is working. All the water on the farm is pumped via solar. So we have a solar well. It only works during the daytime. So cows have enough water storage in those tanks to keep them watered overnight. They don't really drink a lot at night. Just riding by the chicken coop there. I can tell they need a little bit of water. We're going to get feeding water here in just a little bit. I'm going to check the honeybees real quick too. We lost one beehive this year, but there was still honey in there and I'm letting the bees gobble that honey down. Check it out. There's a lot of bees, man. I ain't hanging out for that. Let's check on this truck. See if that battery got any more voltage. We may have to give it a boost because I really killed that battery and it's not a new battery and it's a Walmart Never Start battery too. Let's see what we got. Oh, it says 12 volts already. 80% charge? No. No way. No way. We're going to boost it. Hit it with a booster. No way. It's 80% charge. That quick? I'm not hard to believe. Let's just see. No way. Here we go. Yeah, right. My sneaking suspicion is this battery is so fried. This truck has been sitting here and I haven't used it very much. I've just been working on it and fixing it. It's actually going to be sold here soon. Great truck. 5.0 liter, but it's not an AGM battery. There we go. 5.0 liter. I just don't drive it. I don't use it. I've got too many vehicles as it is and I think it'll make some young man or some young woman a good truck or somebody a great farm truck too. Yeah. Let's check on the tires on Uncle Jesse. Lock. Would you look at that? Would you look at that? We're all pumped up and it shut itself off. How much battery do we have left? Three bars. Awesome. Put our valve stem cap back on. This truck has really crappy tires. This is going to be in future videos. I just haven't had time to work on it. I need to make time to work on it really. All right. This one has a pain in the, you know what, to find the, oh, there it is. Okay. We got to go up around and backwards. Let's see how this works. There you go. There you go, little friend. Memory, 40 PS. Just for giggles. Let's see if Uncle Jesse will fire up, man. I think Uncle Jesse might just fire up. Okay. Got a pull choke here. And Uncle Jesse's keys aren't in here. So we can't have fun. Oh, the fun police. Man. I know where his keys are. Let's go get the keys and see if Uncle Jesse will start. Okay. Please, please. Yeah. This thing sucks. Shifting. Another chore I needed to do. We got a lot of high wind last night. This is all old lumber that I reclaimed. These are all oak boards and such. They came out of a barn that was here on the farm. And I've got oak hand-hewn logs up under here. All up under there, right? So all that stuff is going to be future construction materials for the barn dominium that we're going to be building out here. I hope you're subscribed to the channel. Let's get this covered up so it doesn't rot and go to waste. Stinky! Just like that trash bag. I can't throw stuff away. I just can't do it. I just see potential in everything. I don't know why. That'll catch up with me one day or when I have grandkids that have to clean this place out. Ha, ha. Ha, ha. Ha, ha. Ha, ha. Ha, ha. The dual tires are a pain in the butt to get air in. Ah, come on. There we go. Uh, so I gotta climb down here and get the other tire if I can. I know it's around here somewhere. Shammers. Shammers. There it is. Right in there. Yeah. Memory 40. Look at them tires. Ah, it's a bad set of tires. No. All right. What do y'all think? Uncle Jesse gonna start? Or is Uncle Jesse's battery super dead too? Holy but goody. Call his truck Uncle Jesse because it looks like Uncle Jesse's truck from Dukes of Hazzard. I don't know. Kind of fun. What's life without a little fun? She's a four on the floor buddy. Come on back. Here we go. That ain't the right key. Here we go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Might be out of gas. Fuel pump? Fuel pump. Fuel pump? Fuel pump. Man, come on there buddy. Gosh, we should not give up on this. Let's go get a gas can. Just in case. Just in case. Glug glug glug. I spy it. Uncle Jesse has an issue. A drip drip drip from the tube there. Gotta replace that. I say we put a splash in the carbonators. Come on now. Oh, let's see. This truck has a...oh, heavy... Ah! Grr! Grr! This is the dirtiest engine bay of any vehicle you've ever seen. Guaranteed. Look at that. Oh man. Let's try it without putting gas. Because it's so nasty. I gotta super clean this entire thing. Look at that. That is so gross. Come on now, Jesse. Don't let me down. Look at that. Number two. Attempt number two. Choke. Pump that gas. The battery's a little weak. This dude's got very little gas in it. It ain't got no gas in it. Oh, come on now, Jesse. Alright, this ought to make that starter sing, baby. Put that jump box on there. Here we go. Yeah. Ripping it now. Rip it and rip it, baby. To the floor. Oh man. Come on, Jesse. Make sure there ain't no squirrels in it. This Gulu box has a boost feature. Hit that boost button. That makes that thing sling. It started to sling that motor around. Come on, Jesse. Come on. I know what I need to do. I wonder if I have enough fuel in that gas can. Let's open up this air breather thingy. Make sure there ain't no squirrels in it. Air filters. Seen better days. Get a little out of water in that carburetor. A little bit of that spark of juice. In there. Just a little. There you go, buddy. Just a little. Come on. Come on. Go. Okay. Here we go, senor. Yeah, daddy. That's a fuel issue, for sure. Fired right up as soon as it got fuel. I wonder if the choke is an issue. Ripping it. Come on. Give her some gas. Let's got to get fuel all the way from the empty gas tank all the way into here, and they're up to out. Now we've got fuel right up. That's a fuel issue. And we've got fuel right up since we got fuel. Give her some gas. It's got to get fuel all the way from the empty gas tank all the way into here. way into here we know it runs i can't give up what do you guys think should we give up should we go get another can of gas we're eating up some battery on this gulu oh yep we got a leak here good thing's spraying gas all over me you ain't living right unless you get a little 93 octane on you get her done all right i'm not sure how much gas went in the gas tank and how much gas went in the floorboard i gotta get that filler neck handled gotta pour it all there we go get a little bit in there gosh poured it all in the truck nobody ever accused me of being that bright here we go come on baby i didn't have the choke on before come on baby just keep running just keep on that's six gallons in there it should pick it up fuel pump pick it up bro bro do i have to go down and get another like thing of gas i don't want to do that it's flooded i can smell it all right well we know uncle jesse runs and we've overheated the uh jump box stay tuned for a future video this truck has a dump bed and i need to just clean it up get it squared away and uh use it on the farm it's a dump truck man great dump truck i bought it from my neighbor i actually did a little horse trading for it oh well let's see what she says one percent we'll put her on engine starter she said ready oh no no no she's not ready all right we're gonna let that charge while we go oh we gotta grab a tractor across the farm here bring it up here get it filled with fuel that way it's good to go we're gonna be running the sawmill tomorrow this door is about to make me mad man it what happened was the wind caught it it sprung it it broke this hook right here that holds it in place i just need to go buy a new one i think but what happened it sprung the hinges all the way back and now it's not shutting like it should well now it shuts like it should oh man good it's getting a grab when it's real cold outside these steel buildings tend to swell and shrink and sometimes i'll find that door just blown open and it just basically tries to rip it off i was saying we're going to go over the other side of the farm and uh grab a tractor and bring it over here but i think we're going to take the fuel to the tractor not the tractor to the fuel this is the unicorn dodge truck this is my fuel set up right here and uh it's a little bit janky janky schmanky that's okay now the reason i call this the unicorn dodge it could be more of a unicorn if it was a six speed and a one-ton dually but it's not contact but it is a cummins baby she sounds good so why am i filling up this tractor seems unnecessary right well i'm going up to virginia that's what the virginia folks call it virginia virginia and we are gonna fill up the fuel tank in the back of the truck here because fuel is about 20 cents cheaper per gallon in virginia than it is in north carolina uh we're gonna use off-road diesel but it's still cheaper up there it may be under three bucks a gallon yeah i'll fill this diesel tank up probably three times a year and that's all the fuel that i'll need for the year here on the stony ridge cows do most of the work but i gotta come in and clip behind the cows именно for him so so saw Mill's way over here this is my land that's my neighbor's land we're pretty cool i take care of of their property for them most of the time um they just reimburse me for fuel i've talked to them about leasing uh their pasture for the cows and at some point we may do that or may mow hay but right now i'm just mowing it keeping it up keep it pretty the cast loader is right over here i'll show you guys what a cast loader is this is why i didn't drive my nice truck down through here it's muddy right here and that truck just got a wash job try to keep my trucks clean at least the ones that i use anyway if y'all remember we'll get you a little footage right here of building this bridge built this bridge last year while we're walking this is the log yard there's some trees down here i've got to get cut up you'll see that in a future video these are logs that are going to go on the sawmill all this is going to be milled into two by fours so we can finish out the tool crib in the mega shop that you guys were just in just a minute ago this is the cast loader and this is the wood miser lt40 and i've already been over here making a little bit of lumber you can tell but this is a job for tomorrow cast loaders from tne distributing we've got a tri l grapple on the cast loader that we're moving our logs and all of our brush with we're gonna have a big old bonfire pretty soon it's pretty awesome this is a mini articulating loader meaning it bends in the middle so it's just a mini loader cast mini loader um again from top-notch equipment out of minnesota contact yeah and it's way low on fuel i ran out of gas in this thing one time not fun not cool and don't don't don't leave the door open i busted the glass out of it one time too so check it out when you steer see how the tire gets closer okay you got a loader and then we got a button on here that extends the loader so the boom extends our forward and reverse is right there and that's just how easy a cast loader works very fun my fuel light is on on this thing which means not good we've got to get over there get this thing filled up the reason i didn't uh drive it across the farm was because i was afraid i was going to run out of fuel with it this thing will turn on a dime check it out there's the sawmill i mean look at that that's so cool it's like that's not really cool okay hit it hit it this thing's a little sensitive on filling up it does not like full trigger pressure when i fill it up it'll kick back a little bit so you got to be careful you know what i just noticed a little something here the tire is low on this so i just so happened to bring over the tire pump we're gonna go ahead and fill this tire up see a little bit low right there a lot of bit low that's pretty soft again if you don't have one of these pumps on your farm you just need one even around the house we're gonna go to 24 psi ask me how i know i've had to fill that tire up at least 20 times just got a slow leak okay it's cool be careful you mess up a pretty truck let's give her the news baby let me show you something this looks like a 2000 dodge commercial man this truck is so nice ain't she pretty gosh i told them when they bury me dig a hole big enough for this truck and put me in it right here clear prop we're off to rural king and here's what we're picking up at the rural king oil is cheaper there i'm picking up hydraulic fluid for the gale rt 210 and it says hydraulic fluid capacity 21.5 gallons and i got all the specs right here so i get the right stuff things are cheaper at rural king it's worth the drive we just passed martinsville speedway right back there got some pretty cool rk tractors sitting out here i wonder if anybody will recognize their friend stony ridge farmer in the store here today fingers crossed this used to be kmart my brother used to work here at kmart back in the day and uh had a lot of fun in this parking lot doing donuts in the snow after hours back in my high school days got my wallet this one's gonna be expensive i know it is uh i have to question the sanity of starbucks you know starbucks has a brand new starbucks right here in the rural king parking lot they made starbucks people come on now come on here this is gonna get pricey save five bucks though i like it all right i gotta read my specs hv lpd 46 hydraulic 0530 i guess it's 5w30 boys and girls that one stung that's a 500 bill right there ouch ouch ouch we'll see how much fuel we pump it's gonna be an expensive day again i did buy two batteries i happen to know there's a new f350 coming to the farm stay tuned for a future video we're rescuing a 7.3 liter power strokes f350 you guys are gonna love it okay pork rinds that's my vice can't go in rural king without getting a snack all right let's pump some diesel fuel that was expensive off-road diesel three dollars and five cents baby yeah i put diesel power service in it every single time no matter what ever since i've been doing that i have had no fuel problems on the farm before i did that i had fuel problems all the time i'll post a link i use this with every tank no matter what guys one half of these will do about 50 gallons this says it treats up to 250 gallons it's a 100 gallon tank let's see how expensive this gets good one 222 dollars that's a 700 day

I'm going to say 1%. It's so bad. Why does it keep going over the gel battery? It's not a gel battery. Alright, we're going to put on a 100-ounce booster here to start it. I'm going to get my Gulu. I'll put a link to that Gulu jump starter for you guys. That thing is an indispensable unit too. Between the Gulu jump box and the M18 tire pump there, I'm going to tell you what. I use both of those all the time. Between those two, that's probably the two most used items on the farm when it comes to maintenance and vehicle stuff. Let's see what happens here if we double up.
