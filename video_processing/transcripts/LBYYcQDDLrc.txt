Howto & Style
 Hi guys, I'm back. I'm also planting out some stevia today. I grew this from seed. So when I planted this back in January, only three or four seeds came up. So this is one of those seeds. So when you get a pack of stevia seeds, just be reminded that not too many come up or not too many germinate from that pack. So if you want a lot of stevia, put more than one pack out. Thanks. Bye.
