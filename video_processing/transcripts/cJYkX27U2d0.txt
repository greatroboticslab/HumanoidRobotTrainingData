Howto & Style
 Hey, it's Matt from McGee Farms and got a couple Amazon packages in this week and was going to open them up, kind of show them off a little bit and then as we get them set up, kind of show you how they work out. I ordered these the other day. You know, we've got our new PFAL pin that we're setting up and also we got our chicken house and I was looking in to try to get some kind of a solar lighting setup and I'd seen these. A buddy of mine actually got these and I'll put a link to them on the notes for the description for this video. But they're small solar lights. They've got a little thing to hang. A buddy of mine uses these in his tent sometimes and he's had real good luck with them. They're cheap, so I figure why not try them out. So, opening them up, looking through, like I said, the lights look pretty nice. Kind of impressed with them. The only thing I'm not overly crazy about is the solar panel. It doesn't really have a way to mount it. It looks like, I don't know if this is like a sticky thing where you just kind of peel and stick. I don't know how well, you know, that's really going to hold up over time. But again, these were super cheap, so, you know, if they don't work out, I'm not out that much money. But you just have a small solar panel. Hook up with a, looks like a C connector maybe, like a phone C connector. And it came as a two-pack, so I ended up with, with two of them, two of these, and two little remote controls. I don't know how, how much I'm going to be using the remote controls. I've got some other solar lights at the house with remote control, and I don't think I've ever put batteries in it. But, I don't know, maybe this might be nice for, you know, setting them up, and if I want to turn them on or off from the house. It does have a setting on here, though, for, where it'll be super bright for 30 minutes, not quite so bright for two hours, all the way out to like an eight-hour setting. And my thinking is, two-fold. One, as far as leaving some lights on, it'll maybe help them, you know, if we have predator problems. I'm working on the predator problems right now, and hopefully by the time they become a problem next spring, they won't be a problem. But, also, as we get into where they're not laying as many eggs because of the, the less daylight, you know, this might be a way, if we're wanting more eggs, we can do that. So, I'm going to get these set up today, and I will make a video once we get them in there and kind of show you how they're working. And then, after, I'm sure it's going to take all day to charge them, but if they're working tonight, we'll go out and take a look at how they're working tonight. It's Matt with McGee Farms.
