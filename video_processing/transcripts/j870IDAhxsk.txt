Howto & Style
 Do I need to spend the extra money for flow control valves? My suggestion is you definitely need to install flow control valves in your sprinkler zones that use pop-up spray heads. A typical situation faced by many of our customers is one in which you have multiple zones, one with rotors and a different zone with spray heads. Rotors require at least 50 pounds per square inch of water pressure in order to properly function, and spray heads work best with about 30 psi of water pressure. When the 50 psi reaches your spray heads, misting will occur. By installing flow control valves in your spray head zones, you are able to provide the proper water pressure to all of your sprinklers, resulting in adequate irrigation all around your yard. You can find more detailed videos about controlling water pressure and using flow control valves, spray heads and rotors on the video's webpage. And remember, Sprinkler Warehouse has everything for your irrigation needs so that your trees, lawns, flower beds and gardens are lush and beautiful.
