Howto & Style
 How many ways can you love a planter? Well, I'll give you three reasons that I love this Tierra Verde rubber planter. Number one is it's made of recycled tires, so you're helping keep tires out of landfills. But number two, that rubber makes it unbreakable. The third reason I love it is this giant water reservoir in the bottom. See, the water will stay below this grate, your plant will stay on top, and that'll keep it from getting root rot, but your plant will still get the water that it needs.
