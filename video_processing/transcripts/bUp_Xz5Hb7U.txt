 The Castro's Comprehensive Secondary School was abuzz with excitement this past Friday as students, teachers, and officials gather to celebrate World Home Economics Day 2025 under the theme Tackling Overconsumption. The event, hosted by the school's vocational department, placed a spotlight on food security, sustainable agricultural practices, and the role of responsible consumption in public health. This year's observance took on added significance with the presence of the Ministry of Agriculture, signaling the start of a promising partnership aimed at integrating agri-food systems development and education into the curriculum. Acting Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Dr. Randall Esnard, delivered a compelling address, underscoring the importance of local food production and youth engagement in agriculture. This is why today's event is so important. It brings awareness of these issues and highlights solutions for education and sustainable practices. The Ministry of Agriculture is committed to ensuring that food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture are not just national priorities, but also accessible and practical for our citizens. We have several initiatives that have been implemented to encourage responsible food consumption and promote locally grown produce. These include the Youth in Agriculture, the Youth Agri-Entrepreneurship Programme, which I'm pretty sure that some of you guys have heard about in one form or another, which is designed to empower young persons like yourselves to explore careers in agriculture, food production and agribusiness. The day's activities saw students participating in interactive sessions, food preparation demonstrations, and exhibitions showcasing innovative ways to reduce waste and incorporate more locally grown produce into their diets. The Ministry of Agriculture's educational booth featured live demonstrations of sustainable farming techniques, composting and the benefits of organic food production. Head of the Vocational Department, Priscilla Codra, in emphasizing the importance of equipping students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills that align with national priorities, says she stands ready to partner with allied institutions and relevant authorities to help bring about a greater awareness and appreciation for the benefits of local agri-food offerings among her students. It's a step in the right direction. This is the kind of thing we want to be doing with our students, what we did today, educating them, because they are the ones who will cater for us later and cater for themselves, and we are supposed to guide them. So tackling overconsumption helps our students open their eyes. I was even surprised that even the art students, some of the creations that they came up with in showing how to take care of overconsumption, not just with food, but how to manage the waste. So it definitely started the students thinking, you know, about our future and how they are eating. Because look at our situation with the NCDs, the non-communicable diseases. These are seriously on the rise in St. Lucia. And to me, we need to do much more. We need to have, to me, weekly activities, monthly activities to address those issues. The event also tied into St. Lucia's independence theme, Duvant Assam, Health and Well-Being for a Prosperous Nation, reinforcing the message that food security is integral to national development. With discussions on school gardening projects and upcoming agricultural training initiatives, the foundation was laid for a continued relationship between Castris Comprehensive Secondary School and the Ministry of Agriculture.
