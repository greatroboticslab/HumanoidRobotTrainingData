 Hello viewers welcome to ElimTV a station where you watch you interact and also you learn your tutor today is Mr Wanyoike an agriculture teacher in today's lesson we are in form 3 lesson 10 and the topic is livestock production form and the subtopic is livestock rearing practices on to the lesson or objectives by the end of this lesson you should be able to explain state various methods of controlling parasite and disease other than vaccination and the second one state any three types of vaccines the second the second routine management on livestock rearing that is parasite and disease control remember we covered the first one is feeding the first one feeding as routine management in the previous lesson and there are several methods that we normally use to control parasite and diseases a parasite is an organism which normally live on another organism at the expense of the other one for example a tick we have also parasite like the ones which normally causes diseases and therefore they are supposed to be controlled so that you can end up having high levels of production then the first method of controlling parasite and diseases is deworming and therefore during the warming you can use appropriate uh tool to in to put the dewormers or to introduce into the dewormers into the livestock you can see there is a diagram here of a person who is doing deworming in ship and the person is using a drenching gun to introduce the anti-helminic ticks and those are the drugs which are meant for reduce for controlling worms then we have the second one is dipping and this is aimed at controlling the ecto or external parasite where chemicals such as a carcine they are used used then we have spraying also a sprayer also a carcine is used but in spraying you can use the hand spraying method then the fourth one we have pasture management and during pasture management you can use structures such as the paddock whereby you will be uh regulating the the the paddock or the grease the grazing unit uh using different paddocks and therefore whenever the uh the animals are feeding on a particular paddock uh the other paddocks should be closed uh to make sure that the heat of the sun heats the eggs of the of the parasite and therefore are destroying them and therefore breaking the cycle of parasite uh uh parasite cycle then uh we go to the docking that is another one uh that's referred to the cutting of the tail or tail or tailing it is also referred to as trading and the importance of this is to control the blue fly infestation and the other one we have the hoof trimming whereby a hoof cutter is normally used to cut the overgrown holes so that you can control the hoof rot diseases then we have dust bath a dust bath is an example of a dust bath here we have a peat ash we have a peat ash here or which is normally provided to the pot tree so that they can bathe with it and the pita ash is resp is very very important because it will kill the parasite which normally affect a pot tree then we have vaccination is another method of controlling our diseases or controlling the spreading of diseases vaccination you can vaccinate your animal you can inject your animal with a particular vaccine so that you can control the disease from spreading then methods of vaccination we have you can administer the vaccine through injection as you can see in this diagram the animal is injected using a vaccine then we have the second method we have oral vaccination that's where you introduce the vaccine through the mouth then we have in heration in heration is through the nose and also insertion at the crow aka when it comes to pot tree then types of vaccines we have four in the today's we are going to cover for the first one we have live variant a vaccine is the one which is administered when the disease causing microorganism actually vaccine is a disease causing microorganism whose ability to cause the disease has been reduced and therefore uh for live variant vaccine is the one which is introduced when the disease causing microorganism is the microorganism is uh the disease causing microorganism uh is mixed with the sound chemicals to reduce uh uh its uh powers therefore it will not affect the animal and the form in the the examples of diseases which are controlled using this method or this type of vaccine we have anthrax and also we have brucellosis we have killed an all all dead vaccine that is why you kill the disease causing microorganism then you mix it with the formal from mud hide uh these are chemicals uh then uh you introduce into the body so that the body of an animal can become stimulated to produce its own antibodies then we have the toxi vaccine uh it is in form of homarin and they actually once it is introduced to the the body of animal the animal is stimulated to produce its own immunity then we have properties of good vaccine should be a good immunity it should be as good as natural immunity then the second one uh long shelf life the the immunity which should the vaccine should have a long uh keeping shelf life that is the time the lifespan uh before it expires it should be longer then single dose should produce lifelong immunity then the fourth one easy to administer it is should not be complicated when it comes to uh to introduction of the vaccine into the body then no side effect should not um the the animal or also should not have the farmer who is uh administering them to the animal then compatible with other vaccine yes a good uh vaccine should uh be compatible with other types of vaccine we have come to the end of today's lesson and we are going i'm going to give you assignment the first question define the foreign terms as used in livestock production for uh the first one is vaccine and the second one is vaccination then the second question is highlight in the four types of vaccine used during uh livestock uh production then we have refer reference you can refer from secondary agriculture book student book uh three uh that the publisher is the kenya literature bill for more information you can reach us at a rim tv using the following contacts the first one we have sms using that number then you can reach us through youtube uh facebook at a rim tv and finally you can tweet us at a rim tv underscore ke thank you for joining me in this lesson till next lesson goodbye
