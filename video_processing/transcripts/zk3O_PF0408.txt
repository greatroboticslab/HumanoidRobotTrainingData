 Buster's top ram. So he's let all the boys out. Finbar and my three ram lambs. Hello. It's a beautiful sunny day. I'm setting up the electric fence for the horses. So they're gonna have this field. I'm gonna bale graze them through this field through the winter. You can see the electric fence there. So I'm gonna let them through a gate. One of my primitive gates that are right there. Hey Alfie. You got left behind. Yeah. Everybody else is gone. Poor arthritic Alfie. Except he has a good life here. His shoulders are arthritic. So he walks with a funny gate now. Hey you Alfie. Brindle will even be. You good boy. He's an old man now. All your buddies have gone up over the hill. Yeah I know. You gonna go join them? You've chosen a lovely sunny spot. Cozy and warm. Now. Brr. To let the horses through who are anticipating it. You can see they're waiting. They've figured out I'm gonna be letting them through here. This little gate. You can see there's the owl box. Up in the oak tree. One of them. Okay girls and boy. I'm gonna let you out. Okay. Now it's very slippy. Oh gosh. I don't want to fall underneath Galloping Horse's hooves. They're not going far. They can only graze a bit of grass at a time. And that makes it last through the winter. So they're already coming back. They've got a good length of grazing. They're annoyed that they don't have as far to gallop. Inca! Inca! Maya! Come here! Pop! Come on you two! Come on! Good girls! Come on! There's the rams. In the same field. But they get to free range. Because the horses are heavier beasts. So we'll cut up the soil. So that's why they're only given sections. Snorting. Inca! Inca! Good girl! Come on! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Good girl! Maya! Leave it! You're so thrilled with the new place to graze. You're cutting it all up now ladies! Inca! No! Leave them be! Leave them be! So they'll only get a section at a time. Just so they don't tear the whole field up. Piece by piece. Also having the horses out gives the dung beetles winter feeding. Oh! Oh! She's very frustrated. She didn't get more. Inca! Leave it! Come back here! Come here you bold pup! Come on! Come here! You're bold! No! Inca! Leave them! Good girl! Come on! Woohoo! Look at that gallop! Rearing! Definitely frustrated they can't get more of a gallop in. But I also don't want them to burst their lungs. Because they haven't had the space for a real gallop. And a horse can burst their lungs if they suddenly are given too much space when they've been confined for so long in small spaces. The weather's been miserable so it's really been really really mucky out. Which is why they've been confined in small spaces. Come down to your side in a minute. Okay big fella. This is one of my more primitive homemade gates. We're above the larch trees and the line of beech trees. This is the top field or what we call the wind charger field. Because there used to be a wind charger right there. That's how my mother grew up with electricity. And it used to flicker if the wind was not consistent. So they still had gas lights or kerosene lights. So here's the first bale for the horses. And I'm gonna let them through and hopefully they've had a little bit of a gallop. Hopefully they won't do a huge secondary gallop. Actually no. You know what? I'm gonna wait till later today to let them down to this section. No. No. No. I'm gonna let them through now. I'm gonna let them through now. Because where they're grazing now will over the winter months will become one of the muckiest areas. So may as well let them into this green. There's plenty of grass for them to eat. In amongst the leaves and then out there around the bale. So when the grass is gone they graze the bale. Then I put another bale in the next section. And then when that's gone I put another bale here. Then there. Then there. And the next section there. There. There. And that's how. So that this end of the field will be growing grass again. And will be green by the time the horses are in this section. So that's a form of bale grazing. It makes it so the dung beetles have food through the winter. Those that are flying about the winter dung beetles as Sally Ann mentioned there are. And it also keeps the horses outside and healthy and fed. So yeah. I'm gonna let the horses through now. Come on! Come on! Inca! Maya! No! Come on! Inca! Leave it! Inca! Leave it! Maya! Oooo! My lips are so cold and dry they can't whistle. Maya! Oh my lips are so cold and dry they can't whistle. Atta girl! Good girl! Good Maya! Clever pup! Clever pup! Yes! You clever girl! So that's the beginning of winter bale grazing for the horses and how they help the farm. They'll manure that area, the hay will fertilize the area and seed the area. And I'll throw seed out there as well to add to the diversity. And they're lovely and calm, which is good. So no lungs will get blown out. That's the scary thing with horses is if they've been confined to barracks due to the really mucky wet weather and you let them out into a big space, they could gallop for glee and burst their lungs or burst a lung. So it's always better to let them out slowly. Oh, here we go. No, she's not going to jump the fence. Maybe I spoke too soon. Maya! Maya! No! Maya! Good girl! I'll settle down. No burst lungs today. I'm done. I'm hopeful. Okay? I'll чер fun yesterday. I'll roll. Once more toxins will fall at the close interest as well.
