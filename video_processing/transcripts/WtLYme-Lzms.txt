Education
 All right, thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. So I'm going to talk for a few minutes about weed management and strawberries. And just to put a few kind of qualifiers on here, I'm going to summarize what we do in Florida for weed management. So that means everything that I'm talking about is in regards to plasticulture production, although a lot of the techniques do go beyond that. I'm going to kind of frame this around an integrated weed management program because one thing we have found is that no single tool will solve the problem, but you've got to integrate a bunch of them. So I'm going to spend a little bit more time on some components of this than others. But we're going to highlight some of the things we found last few years, but also highlight kind of the standard practices here in Florida. So to start with, we're going to start with fumigation. The vast majority of strawberries in Florida are fumigated. We do have around anywhere from six to 800 acres of organic strawberries in the county where I'm at, which is Hillsborough County. And that kind of varies depending from year to year, depending on the market. But as far as fumigation goes, we just completed a management survey a short while ago. And the most common fumigant in Florida and strawberries is piclor 60. And as commonly thought of for control of pathogens and nematodes, it does provide some weed control as well, which I'll talk about a little bit in a minute. Tellone C35 used to be the most common fumigant, but it's no longer as common as piclor 60. And then there are a few growers that use KPM or VATAM as well, which its strong point is weed control. The one of the reasons that we use these combinations of tellone and chloropicrin is because of the fact in terms of weed control, they're much more effective when combined. Now these pictures I'm going to show you next couple of pictures are in tomatoes, but you see the same trend in strawberries. So the picture on the left is your non treated. And you can see nutsedge coming through the plastic here. If you add 50 pounds of chloropicrin, 50 pounds of pic, you actually make the problem worse. And that's because low levels of pic will stimulate nutsedge sprouting. If you get up around 200 pounds of pic, well, then you've certainly reduced the population compared to a non treated, but you don't get great control. If you look at same picture on the left is untreated. Middle that's still 50 pounds of pic, but the picture on the right now this is 15 gallons per acre of one 3D. It essentially doesn't have any effect on that set of control on its own. But this is where you really see the difference. Once you combine that pic and the one 3D, you see a really clean bed and it's that combination of products that gives optimizes weed control. And we see that consistently across all crops and the that combination improves control. Now, here is a key point though, is it's really weather dependent. So those pictures that I'm showing you where we get really good control of nutsedge. Those are fumigated in January in Florida. So that's when the soil is a bit cooler. If you look at this picture on the left is pic or 60 on the right is non fumigated. Almost no difference. Those are fumigated in July when it's really hot. So we for weed control when it comes to fumigation, you have to take into account whether cooler, slightly cooler soils are going to give you better weed control just because the fumigate moves through the soil more slowly. We've done a lot of long term fumigation trials the last few years, and I'm not going to spend a lot of time in this because fumigation is not kind of where I want to spend all the time. But I do want to point out this picture to give you an example on the left is non fumigated on the right is pic or 60. And again, on the left is non fumigated on the right is the Florida three way. What we call the Florida three way is a combination. So in this case pic or 60 plus K PAM on the top. And early in the season, you don't see a lot of a lot of difference. But when you move through late in the season, you see where we didn't fumigate, we just got hammered with disease. Pic or 60 did fairly well, but there's a lot of variability in those plants. If you look at this three way picture on the right, you see consistency. Just to show you another picture of how extreme this can be. We don't use Paladin anymore, but this still shows you the difference of the Florida three way versus not the bottom left hand picture. So that's Paladin pick 21. You can see all those grasses and broadleaf weeds growing in there. This is the same field here. We have Paladin plus K PAM. You can see how much cleaner it is. So consistently, if we have a problem field that's going to be fumigated that has a lot of weeds, the Florida three way or what Georgia, they call it the Georgia three way. That combination gives you the best control and in our studies actually gives you the best economic return as well. So real quick use combinations if you fumigate cooler temperatures are going to give you a better week control. The Florida three way is the best in terms of week control as well as economic return. And it's the best in terms of broadleaf and grass control as well. When it comes to herbicides. So I'm going to talk about some pre-herbicides, pre-emergence herbicides, the ones that you apply before the weeds are up. So in Florida, we're going to talk about herbicides that go underneath the plastic mulch so you can have this equipment you can see here, which is a bed press, which has nozzles on the back, which can spray the herbicide directly on the bed immediately before we lay the plastic. This is not a real common practice in Florida. Not a lot of people are using herbicides under the plastic. It does occur, especially in fields where there are problems with broadleaf grass weeds. Here is a summary of the most common herbicides used in Florida. Historically, the recommendation was a combination of gold and Devonel. We've moved away from that. Chateau is now the most common recommendation. And there's a few reasons for that. If you look down, this is just a few weed species that we have in Florida strawberries. And black medic and caroglion geranium are two common ones. You see Chateau provides some suppression of those two species. Whereas the other two products do not. Generally speaking, Chateau persists a little longer and provides really good excellent weed control of most species a little bit better than gold. Although gold is also a very good product. You might be wondering why historically would they have mixed gold and Devonel. While that's simple, this next chart shows it. Devonel is much better on grasses than Chateau or gold. So that gold plus Devonel mix gave you a better overall weed control. However, Chateau is pretty decent, better than gold on grasses. And the last price I did, which was admittedly a little over a year ago, but it was some prices changed a lot. But at the time, Chateau was at around $20 per acre. A gold Devonel mix costs around $120 per acre. So a big difference in cost, which is why we've kind of moved away from that mix and settled on Chateau is the best option. Unfortunately, neither one of the none of these products work on nutsedge. There are no effective herbicides registered for nutsedge control in strawberry. Just a real quick blurb on flumioxazin, which is the active ingredient in Chateau. This chart right here, we did this trial a short time ago looking at the red labeled rates, which is 1x all the way up to ridiculously high rates. Something that you would never use. So we were just trying to highlight what rate would you have to use to see damage. And we did this across a lot of different sites. And you can see I'm pointing at these dots where the 1x rate, which is 3 ounces per acre, 2x rate or 4x rate. This is essentially no damage. You have to go all the way up to 8 times the label rate to cause damage with Chateau. So it's extremely safe. If you do get damage, this is what it looks like. So Chateau, if you get it on the bed and it comes up through the roots, you can see the browning on the veins. That's what Chateau will do. It'll burn the veins up. And of course, that leaf will die. If you have real high rates, the plant is not likely going to recover. This graph is Chateau persistence over the season. And I know it goes up a little bit here, but this is just kind of a little bit of accumulation effect. But basically, the reason we like Chateau is because of the fact that it persists throughout our season. So it's a really good product. Just a couple of things. Strawberries are extremely tolerant of Chateau. You can apply it. Don't, of course, but we went up to four times the label rate without any damage. It persists for the whole season. That's a good thing. Unless you're going to use that plastic for a second crop, then that could be a problem for you. I have gone to a few fields over the last few years where we saw some Chateau damage. And the three bullet points in the bottom here, these are the three reasons we've seen damage. Number one, inadequate agitation in the tank. So Chateau right now is a granular, although that formulation is changing. And there's been cases where people didn't agitate it. You get also, you release a clump of herbicide in the middle of the field and you get a, you know, a spot where you get some damage. You have an inexperienced driver who slows down near the end of the row. And on your Dolphison, you get really high rates near the end of the row. So that can happen. Or Chateau is supposed to be put on the top of the bed right before you lay the plastic. There's been a few people sprayed on the flat and then pull that bed up and you end up with the concentrated lines of herbicide right where the plants are. And that also can cause damage. Most of the herbicides that are used in strawberries are used in the row middles. And that's pretty well. Every single grower does apply herbicides in the row middles in Florida, except for the organic growers, which tend to rely on cultivation. We've done a lot of trials in different crops looking at which herbicides are the most effective. And this is just a table showing two different seasons. And this was weed density in the row middle. And you can see Chateau consistently dropped weed density significantly. Dual Chateau and Dual and Gold did fairly well, but not really any better than Chateau alone. I mentioned dual because it's recently been registered in strawberries in Florida. I don't believe it's registered in Alabama, but we can use it in their own middle. I'm not 100% sure of it in Alabama. This is an example of a row middle. This is again, this particular one was in tomatoes, but you can see non-treated versus Chateau application. We had your mock time mixed there to burn down what was green and big difference. So really, really good control this. This is just a summary of the most effective options and the most common used ones in Florida. So a lot of growers will before transplant will use a combination of aim and Chateau to burn down what's there and to give them residual control or gramoxone and Chateau. Few will use gold and gramoxone and there are a few that use glyphosate after transplant. There are a lot of growers that use glyphosate or gramoxone plus Chateau mix that can be sprayed up to fruit set, but not after. Just a couple of things of warning with Chateau if you spray it in row middles, it does persist a long time. That's its strength. But you can, there's a risk of if you have a sandy soil like we do in Florida and you get a lot of wind, or you can actually have particles of sand blow up into the fruit. If you wait too long to apply that application, you get little burn marks. So something you don't want to go too close to when you think you're going to be picking. With glyphosate really common problem is this yellowing. This is a little bit of drift when they were spraying it. This is very typical of left to say around up damage and strawberries where you see the growing points. And even the buds down here all kind of turn of a yellowy twin yellowy twin. So you need to be careful if you use glyphosate after transplant. Careful to do everything you can to minimize drift. I'm going to mention this particular species because we historically did not have ragweed parthenium in our strawberries. It started down south of Florida. It has since moved rapidly northward. Now I pretty much see it in all of our strawberry fields. A lot of people mix it up with common ragweed. And really easy to tell them apart if you look at this picture. Ragweed parthenium has white veins, which common ragweed does not. And common ragweed, if you look at the top, that's common ragweed. A little bit more finely divided leaf. Of course, the dead giveaway is these small white flowers look like little puff clouds. And then you have also the vein is he's really sorry, the stem is he's really prominent veins. So why why we're concerned about ragweed parthenium and why I'm mentioning it today is we've seen consistently it's moving rapidly northward. And this is what it looks like just a couple of days ago in some fields what they had terminated with herbicides. And you can see the ragweed parthenium is happily still growing. It's very tolerant of glyphosate and very tolerant of gramoxone. So it will happily grow and if you don't control those few that are left. This is a pepper field just south of me. And you can see these white lines that is it filling the row middles between these rows of peppers. And it's very difficult to manage. In strawberries, you only have two options at the moment. One is chateau again, this is the number of weeds per pot. So we're looking at the effects of these herbicides on controlling pre-emerge. So putting it down before the weed comes up. And this NTC is a non-treated control. And then you see three and six ounces of chateau give really good control. They won't control it 100%, but they do certainly reduce the density. After that, the only options is hand pulling, hauling or cultivation. There are no herbicides that can be used within a strawberry crop to control the species. We do have some products that are working. And we have spent some time working on getting a label for those in strawberries. And that will be a national label once we make a little bit more progress. So something to consider with this species. If you do see it in strawberry fields, it tends to start on the edges, on the field edges. So you need to make sure you remove it. Now in Florida, we usually terminate all strawberries at some point, either with a herbicide or with a fumigant herbicide. Of course, being the most common approach. And K-PAM or VAPAM being the ones that are used the most often. So this is just a series of pictures where we looked at different rates of, in this case, it's K-PAM. VAPAM basically, you get the same data. And looking at how much it takes to kill strawberries. This is at the end of the season. You want to inject K-PAM. And the advantage of doing this is that you not only terminate strawberries, but you kill the weeds. And you also kill seeds in the soil and pathogens and nematodes. So at 10 gallons per acre, you can see this red box that perfectly good strawberry control at very low rate of 10 gallons per acre. So if you have a nice clean field and not really any pest pressure and you just want to terminate your crop, this could be an option, although it's going to be more expensive than herbicides. However, if you go to a part of your field where you have a lot of nutsedge, which is the case in this picture. And I'm just using nutsedge because you can visually see the difference. At 10 gallons per acre, you still have a lot of green weeds growing because you don't, there's not as much spread and there just isn't as you get control in the center. This is with one drip tape, but you're not getting control in the bed edges. If you up it to 40 gallons per acre, there's still a little bit of green, but you get much, much better control. And overall, we control, which means it's going to, if it will kill nutsedge on the edges, it's killing other pests that also occur on the bed edges. So we use this type of technique if we have issues with these diseases like charcoal rot and strawberry. This can be an effective way to minimize chance of infection the following year. We've done a lot of studies looking at rates. So you can see this is a non treated and petri dishes, these black dots. This is actually Macrofemina growing and Petri dish. At 10 gallons per acre, you drop it in the center, but the side still pretty bad. 20 gallons per acre, similar story. 30 gallons per acre. This yellow is not Macrofemina. This is a different organism that's not of concern, but you're still not reaching the side at 40 gallons per acre. You start to get much better control. So crop termination with VAPAM helps with diseases, but it also helps with weeds. So for example, the most common weed we have in strawberries in Florida is goosegrass. And if you look at this chart here, this is the dose of Matam potassium or KPM. This is percent control. And you can see, and this is control, not of the plants. This is control of the seeds. And this is what's really important is you can get significant kill of a seed bank with a good application of something like KPM. And this rate right around here would be equivalent to 40 gallons per acre, which means that around 40 gallons per acre, you're going to get decent control of seeds. Common purslane and other weed that we have a lot of, this would be a very similar trend. You can see decent control with application of KPM. So summary, 10 gallons per acre will adequately terminate a strawberry crop, but you need much higher rates right around 40 gallons per acre acre. If you want to optimize weed control and control of a lot of pathogens like Macroformina. I do want to mention fallow program. So our season, of course, is a little different than yours, but generally speaking, we are fumigating and putting beds in August. We plant in September and we're harvesting through to March or April, depending on markets and things like that. That means we have a fallow program in from April all the way through to the following June. Or April, May and June, sometimes in July, and then perhaps part of August. So several months there where we have bare ground. A little over 80%, somewhere around 85% of the strawberry acreage is cover crop every year. There's a lot of important reasons for us to do that. That's our wettest time of the year. So cover crops help with things like erosion and helping improve a water uptake for our aquifers. But cover crops also do inhibit weeds. You can see this picture on the right hand side, taken underneath the canopy. You see hardly almost no weed seeds germinating there. So good cover crop inhibits weed growth and suppresses weed seed production. And can emphasize the importance of, you know, there's all kinds of reasons to cover crop for soil structure, for soil health. But just in terms of weed control, you can really reduce weed growth and prevent seed production with a properly managed cover crop. Now that's true for broadleaf weeds and it's true for grass seeds. And actually in some of our long term trials, the presence or absence of a good fallow program, whether that's cover crops or herbicides, was more important than deciding which fumigate to use. So that just kind of gives you an idea of how important a good fallow program is. That decision of what to grow when you didn't have strawberries there had a much greater effect on the number of weeds than even what fumigate you selected. When it comes to nutsedge management, cover crops are not a good option. And the reason for that is nutsedge will happily grow underneath the canopy of even the most dense cover crops. This is a picture of sunhemp. Even under sunhemp, which can form an incredibly thick canopy cover, um, nutsedge will continue to happily grow. Now it won't produce as many tubers. So you do prevent your populations from getting bigger, which is good, but you don't reduce the population. So if you have a field with a nutsedge problem, you're much better off to use something like cultivation and glyphosate combinations. So basically what you want to do is you want to allow the nutsedge to grow. You want to spray glyphosate when you have a nutsedge about, I don't know, seven inches tall, certainly before it flowers. Then you want to cultivate to stimulate more, um, sprouting and then spray again. Doing that a couple of times will optimize your nutsedge control. So that kind of gives you a summary of the overall, um, approach to weed control. Uh, there's one other thing I want to cover here shortly, but again, I want to emphasize the one thing that we have know for certain is that effective weed control over long term is you've got to integrate more than one tool at a time. And one of the reasons that we don't have as many issues with herbicide resistance, for example, in many specialty crops like strawberries is because we have historically used very integrated weed management programs. So you want to continue to make sure that you do that. So we, um, last few years we've been doing something kind of fun. I'm just going to mention this quickly. Uh, here in Florida, we do this practice of, of relay cropping where we plant a second crop into our strawberries. So, um, in this case, you can see eggplants growing in strawberries. What would happen is somewhere around January, which is when we're full out harvesting strawberries, they will come through and they'll plant eggplants, cantaloupes, or peppers. In down the center of the beds. We grow two rows of strawberries in one bed with one drip tape down the center. So they'll plant a second crop right down the center along the side of that drip tape. And then when it comes near the end of the strawberry season, the standard practice right now would be to remove those strawberries by hand and allow that second crop to grow. So the advantage and the reason they do relay cropping versus terminating the strawberries and then planting a second crop. It's all about timing. It allows them to get another crop to market sooner. Um, without the gap between when one crop ends and another one starts. And, um, there's that, there's that advantage of timing. The strawberries do provide some protection. So it allows you to get basically it allows you to get two crops in a time period when you normally couldn't get them because part of that time they're growing together. The downside of this approach is, as you can imagine, hand removal of strawberries is labor intensive. So we started, um, developing this shield, which is really very simple. This is just a prototype. It's basically a triangular sealed shield that you can adjust the width at the bottom. And then on the outside on each side, we have nauseous. I'll just show you the back of it as well. And we have at the front is kind of flanged out slightly. So what it does is as you pull through the field, in this case, I'm showing you with eggplants again, it pulls the leaves of the eggplant up and into this triangular shield. And then you're spraying the herbicide on the outside to kill the strawberries. So when you pass an open area, you can see this dry line down the center of the bed. That's where the herbicide didn't touch, which is, and your plant is covered. And then this wet area on the outside, both sides, that's where the herbicide would have been sprayed. So what this looks like is right here. Um, the strawberries eventually die and you continue to grow. So in this case, we were testing hand removal versus herbicide removal in eggplants. We've done it in cantaloupes and we've also done it in peppers. Not a great idea for cantaloupes, but for peppers, anything growing upright, the peppers and eggplants is a great idea. It works really well and, um, no, no effects on yield. As a matter of fact, if you plant the second crop at the right time, you actually get a bit of a yield boost. Um, just because as I started to mention earlier, the strawberries provide some level of protection. Against cold periods or colder weather or wind. So with that, I wanna, I know I've gone kinda long already and I wanna make sure if there's any questions, there's a chance to ask those. But, um, wanna acknowledge I've got a great team down here. There's a lot of, there's a lot of this work for me and we are funded by the Florida Strawberry Growers Association, as well as the Florida Department of Agriculture. There's a lot of people need to think about how extreme for the animator. Supp expands to read the box we just get. The kid's doing this Fight Hangouts Association to reach out his lungs. At least when they go wrong withoutetto, it's good. Number four, I wanna make sure if the night is kinda good. Give it a Abiha<|fi|>, braking one realria,agara, CA, and the震Ga, and the construction. Over those two are my teammates. Thank you.
