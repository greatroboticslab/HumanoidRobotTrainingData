 And you hear the term regenerative practices a lot. And I'll say that's something that like, I'm not sure exists. To me, like regenerative agriculture and regeneration in general, it's based on principles. And so a regenerative practice doesn't necessarily exist because there aren't practices that are regenerative, right? Regeneration is an outcome that we're trying to achieve. And so how do we achieve that outcome? And there's lots of different ways to do that. But it's kind of in the way that you apply whatever practice it is. Because any given practice can achieve a regenerative outcome or it could degenerate. The same practice on different operations in different climates, in different states, different rainfall areas. And so, you know, I try to keep that in mind that it's a lot, I say it's simpler. It's more complex than just practices. It's how do you apply principles.
