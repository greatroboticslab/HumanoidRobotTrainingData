 which is a real kick in the shorts. Aaron Pape is a farmer from Peshtigo in northeastern Wisconsin. He recently got a disturbing message from the federal government. They replied back that they owed me about $30,000, but then there was some very disconcerting language. We're unable to pay on this contract at this time and don't know when funds will be made available because it was contracted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Any further practice implementation is at my own discretion. The message came from the Natural Resources Conservation Service about the reimbursement contract they have with the Pape Family Farm. $30,000 might not be a lot of money to some people, but it's a lot to me, it's a lot to my business, and I need that money to operate. I was counting on that money to be able to operate my farm this year. If I don't get paid that 30 grand, I gotta go borrow that money. The reimbursement contract was going to help the Pape's pay for seed, a watering system, and fence. And in return, we're taking worn out cropland that's been highly eroded, causing water quality impacts, and we're putting in a permanent perennial grass. I think it's a win-win program. Pape says the freeze is adding more economic uncertainty for farmers also being hit with the end of USAID, which will cost farmers hundreds of millions of dollars in income. Plus, farmers could bear the brunt of retaliation from tariffs affecting fertilizer pricing and availability right away, all rippling through the rest of the rural economy. The federal government is just being hit with a sledgehammer right now, and programs are just being smashed, and departments being closed at the drop of a hat. It's way too chaotic. It's making it very difficult to react to. Pape says he expected elected leaders to make well-thought-out decisions that are in the best interests of the people. I'm a pretty conservative guy, a longstanding Christian, and have very conservative moral and social values, you could say. But at the end of the day, I understand that competency in government is a good thing.
