 Did you know you can grow peanuts from grocery store nuts? Here's the lazy way to grow a snack factory. Use raw peanuts, not roasted. Soak them overnight to boost germination. Plant in sandy soil, they need room to grow underground. Space 6 inches apart. They love full sun and warm weather. Water when soil feels dry 1 inch down. Watch for yellow flowers, they'll bend down and dig into soil to form peanuts. In 4 to 5 months? Fresh peanuts ready to roast or boil. Save for planting day.
