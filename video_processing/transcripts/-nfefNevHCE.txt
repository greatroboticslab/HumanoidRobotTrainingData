 For small scale farmers, I know you've been wondering what are the most profitable crops that you can manage to build and earn some decent profit. These are farmers who have less than an acre of land and most of them own one acre of a acre or what is commonly known as 15 by 100. Land is becoming scarce and we are increasing in population. At the end of the day, you can still make some decent profit and especially the youth who are graduating and you have small piece of land. This is a good way to employ your staff. These are the 5 most profitable crops that you can grow. They don't require much capital. They don't require much knowledge. They are fast maturing and also they have a wider market. By wider market, I mean you can sell them even to your immediate neighbor. And regardless of the market supply, imagine we still get people who will buy as long as you maintain the cost as minimal as possible. But first, let's understand what is profit. Profit is the amount that you get after deducting your cost from the revenue you earn. What do I mean? I mean if you have 10,000 heads of cabbage and you sell it at 15 shillings, you manage to get 150,000 shillings. That is 11. That is not profit. If you handicap 10 shillings to produce each cabbage, it means your total cost of producing the 10,000 heads of cabbage was 100,000 shillings. Now to get your profit, you take the 150,000 shillings, you less the 100,000 shillings. You will get your profit as 50,000 shillings. That is the profit. Most farmers don't know how to calculate this. They assume once you've sold your produce, that is the profit. No, that is usually not the profit. That is revenue. And when you are factoring the profit, remember also to pay yourself. Assume that what you put there, the energy, the time, and all the resources that you put there when you are cultivating this crop. Assuming that you had employed someone else with similar work, how much would he have charged you? If you would have charged you 300 or 500 shillings, that is your cost of labor. And you have to factor in to get a true value of your profits. In 2025, these five crops can give you some good cash. But let us be realistic. By this, I mean you cannot affect super abnormal profits in family. There is nothing like making tens of millions in one day. Now profitability in agriculture is you make 10% profit, 20% profit. The problem with most of us, we are greedy and we want to have abnormal profits. We want to make 100,000 from investing in one round. That one doesn't happen. So if you invest 100 and you get 200 as profit, that's okay. These are the five crops that you can manage to do and get some good profit. And number one is beans. In short, Mahalagwe. This can be either new beans, or low-stopper beans, or waizimu, all those types of beans. And good thing with beans is that they are fast maturing. And then also number two, they are not perishable. Number three, you can sell to anyone. After they are dry and you harvested them, you can take to the local market or to the cereal stores. So they will still buy. This makes it a good crop to do. The other thing that makes it a good crop to do is the cost of producing it. Imagine in a night of a nacre, you only need 2.5 kgs. So this will cost you roughly around 250 shillings. If you put now all the other costs of producing them around 500 shillings for chemicals and maybe an extra additional cost of 1,000, you will get a total production cost of around 2,750. If you are good at it and the season is okay and you manage to harvest around 1.5 bars. Each weigh 90 kgs and you are also lucky to sell at 80 shillings per kilo, then you will earn 10,800 shillings from your 1.5 bars. The second most profitable crop for small-scale farmers is a garden piece or what is often known as a Minji. Minji tend to be loved by many. Though, they are also quite expensive. The funny thing which means it tends to come from only one region around Yandaro County. But if the farmers can manage to tap into this market, there is high demand. The oversupply that may be experienced around the year is also short-lived, meaning that prices are often high above 70 shillings. If you are a small-scale farmer with a name of a nacre, you only need 2 kgs. This one will cost you 1,800. If you add other costs of 1,500 shillings, it means that your total cost of production will be around 3,300 shillings. If you manage it well, this and a name of a nacre can manage to give you 200 kgs of green peas or Minji. Selling it on a market price of 40 shillings per kilo, you manage to get a lovely revenue of 8,000 shillings. If you list your 3,300 the cost of production, you are left with a profit of around 4,700 shillings. And remember, this is the lowest price of 40 shillings per kilo. Sometimes it goes to over 70 shillings per kilo. The very most profitable crop for small-scale farmers is the niall, what is often known as a coriander. The good thing with coriander is it's fast growing. Within 30 to that 5 days, it's ready for harvesting. And mind you, it doesn't need those expensive chemicals or even fertilizer. You just plant it and manage it. And that's all. You are good to go. And within those at least, let's say 40 days, you will manage to have harvested around 200 kilos from the farm. If you sell each kg for 40 shillings, then it gives you a leavening of 8,000 shillings. If you list your cost of 2,300 shillings, you are left with a profit of 5,700. This is a good profit for small-scale farmers in a month. And you can replicate this such that you'll always have this produce every month, making you a source of income, a stable one every month. My fourth most profitable crop for small-scale farmers is Green Maze. What Green Maze? Green Maze is what is known as Mahindiyakuchoma. The demand for Mahindiyakuchoma, the Green Maze has been on the rise. Most people are loving it. And even those who cook the very old boiled maze, they buy it from these people because they know how to select the best one in the sweetest one. And remember, the secret on this one is to do the varieties that they love. Not all maze varieties is good for roasting. We have to get this. And if you are totally interested in this, make sure you've watched our video on the best maze variety for maze roasters. And that one that once you have it, they will come running for you. And ensure that you do the maize that they love. In one-eighth of a nacre, you need a free 1 kg of this maize. This will cost you around 500 shillings. If you add your cost of production, that is maybe wind-in, also fertilizer, it will give you a total cost of 2,500 shillings. Now, this farmer will manage to produce around 2,000 pieces of maize. A lot is often called azias. If he sells it at 5 shillings, it's at lowest, then he makes up a revenue of 10,000 shillings. If you less now the cost of 2,500 shillings, he makes a profit of 7,500 a shillings. The good thing with green maize is one, but you don't have to sell it green. If you don't get the market, you can manage to let it dry. And by letting this dry, you will harvest around 5 bags each way 90 kg. So if you sell each bag at around 2,000 shillings, you earn a revenue of 10,000 shillings. However, by letting it dry, it may add an extra cost of 2,000 shillings, making a total cost of production to 4,500 shillings. If you less 4,500 from the 10,000 and 11, you are left with the profit of 5,500 shillings. My last most profitable crop for small-scale farmers is indigenous vegetables. And by indigenous vegetables, I mean Managu, Chelele, Amalangas, we mean spider plant, Saga, Mulenda, all those indigenous vegetables. Why they are most profitable is one, they are cheap to produce. Imagine by less than 50 shillings, you have a packet of seeds that you can plant and give you around 1,000 shillings. Then the good thing with them is that they are not that much highly perishable. Then the other thing, you can harvest for quite some time. And also you have a wider market including the neighbors. You can send them to the neighbors. Okay. So these indigenous vegetables, they are a good source of income. They are also quite profitable if done well. And by consistency, you can be selling to the local grocery stores, our Mamavi Bandai. Once they realize that you have it, they will always be coming to you. Because what they need is sustainable supply. And this applies to all these 5 crops. Once you have a sustainable supply all year around that you have mastered on these several crops. Once they realize that, they will always be coming to you.
