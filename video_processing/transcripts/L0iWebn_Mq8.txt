 I'm Phil Bowden. I'm the agronomist with Pulse Agronomy Australia, ex Pulse Australia and ex DPI. I specialise in pest management. Farmers should be monitoring at the moment particularly for aphids. The usual suspects of green peach aphid and cabbage aphid we often see at this time of year and the one of most concern is green peach aphid because it's high chemical resistance and also the fact that it will transfer virus very quickly into plants. In general though you know a lot of these aphids are pretty well controlled by a lot of the natural enemies. You should be seeing evidence of parasitism from the parasitic wasps. You might see lady beetle larvae, hoverfly larvae and lacewing larvae that are very capable of keeping those aphid pests in check. If you're not seeing it though, well I guess you have to make a decision whether you need to spray. The current recommendation would be for one of the soft chemicals Pyramor Transform are the two that are currently used with good effect. They don't affect the beneficial insects. With the latest canola varieties that are often very vigorous, those varieties can often outgrow damage. But yeah it's just a matter of monitoring regularly to see what's in the crop. I mean that's I guess the basic principle of integrated pest management is out there monitoring regularly systematically so that you know what you're dealing with in the crop. Grazing can have an effect on keeping pests in check but it's usually when the grazing pressure is very high you know so you'll still have residual pest numbers after grazing. So that's when it's important like to just go and monitor regularly to see what you're dealing with in in the field after grazing. And then you know after grazing farmers are often top dressing so that's getting the crop off to a higher growth rate as well that can help. And you know with a lot of the current varieties that are very vigorous they will outgrow any damage. So very rarely at this time of year that we need to intervene with a chemical. Getting back to our basic principles of integrated pest management it's out there checking regularly monitoring that you so you know what you're dealing with. Then you can make decisions about whether there are natural enemies there that are keeping it under control or whether you have to use a chemical and or or other management tool. There are lots of resources available. The most high profile one is probably PESFAX which is a a service that's offered by CESAR group from Melbourne University and that relies on farmers and agronomists sending them information whenever they see you know anomalies in crops or they want identification done. They have a very good service and that's usually you know taking a photo of any unusual occurrence they might see in a crop whether it's distorted leaves or you know signs or symptoms of pests and they need it identified that can be done through PESFAX or through local land services with their local agronomists and they will send it on to well CESAR or myself or someone to get it get it identified. So there are resources there there's quite a bit of written material there, Grow Notes for example which is a GRDC resource on the website and Pulse Australia websites is still active they can they can be used to help with pest identification.
