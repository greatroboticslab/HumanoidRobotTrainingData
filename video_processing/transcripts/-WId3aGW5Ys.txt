Managing Nitrogen and water this summer crop planting season

 Hi everybody, Bill Manning here from Northwest Local Land Services. Just thought we'd remind everybody of a few summer cropping issues. We've had some great rain around the northwest and prospects for summer crops are looking quite good at this stage. But we have had many issues where paddocks have been flooded and inundated with moisture and that can create a few issues for cropping. One of those is that flooded paddocks can seal at the surface. Our high clay soils can seal off somewhat like a dam and this can reduce moisture infiltration into the soil profile. So if you have had a flooded paddock and you're thinking that it's full of moisture, best to go around with a soil corer or a probe and just check those moisture levels before you make a decision about summer cropping. The other issue that can occur with very wet verticols is denitrification. The soil microbes that live in the soil and feed off organic matter like you and I require oxygen to carry out those processes. Usually they obtain that from the air like we do but under conditions of water logging they can get their oxygen from nitrate molecules in the soil. Nitrate is the main form in which soil nitrogen is stored. After they extract that oxygen the nitrate component of the molecule can then be lost to the atmosphere as gas and this represents a loss from our cropping system. And so once again if you have had soils that have been flooded or inundated think about doing some soil nitrate tests before you make nitrogen application decisions in the summer. Remember that the nitrate may not have been lost it may have just been pushed further down the profile of the soil. In which case it will not become available until later in the crops growth cycle. A few people are already talking about double cropping this year maybe putting some mung beans into their cereal stubble. I would urge caution in that we still have a few months of crop growth to go and our winter cereal crops still have plenty of time to draw down that soil moisture before maturity and if we get a drier spring early summer our soil moisture levels could be depleted under our cropping country. So once again this is an opportunity for you to inform yourself about paddock conditions before you make a decision. Okay then thanks very much. Thanks very much.
