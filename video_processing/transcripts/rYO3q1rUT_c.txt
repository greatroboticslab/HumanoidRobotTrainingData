 In today's video you will learn or be refreshed about the top ways to grow healthier vegetables in your organic garden. Organic gardening faces more challenges than conventional gardening methods due to a zero tolerance to harmful chemical use. But it is very possible to get a higher yielding harvest because other gardening methods overlook fundamental points to a stronger crop. This brings me to my first tip, nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation is a key building block to fertile soils for your vegetables. Plants need the ammonia form of nitrogen for essential life components like proteins and amino acids. However they can't use the nitrogen which makes up 80% of the air we breathe in. Therefore planting legumes like peas and beans will fix nitrogen in the soil by being stored in their nose. This nitrogen can then be used up by other plants requiring this. Companion plant broad beans, sugar snap peas, peas and other legumes with other vegetables and as a result they will promote plant growth. Secondly is to mulch raised beds in the autumn with a 3 inch layer of either well rotted manure, leaves or leaf mould and cover with a dark plastic. Make sure it is moist beforehand. This will let earthworms and decomposers to work thoroughly at decomposing the organic matter over winter resulting in a more fertile soil to grow vegetables in spring and also being warmer as plastic absorbs warmth. Ensure you poke a few holes to allow a flow of oxygen otherwise decomposition will not be possible.

This is an especially important tip if you have a small garden or even limit to a balcony but growing organic vegetables can be done in almost any situation. Also, people with larger gardens should strive to include containers to grow some of their produce in. But why? Containers make it easy to transplant plants, stop them becoming invasive, for example mint, and it can be used to grow vegetables on hard surfaces, for example on a patio or trellis, which will maximise yields. Containers don't have to be plastic. Containers don't have to be plastic. They can easily assemble together wooden plant boxes or make hanging baskets out of dowels to grow cherry tomatoes. The possibility is endless. My fourth tip is to work with nature by attracting beneficial insects such as pollinators or bugs, which will help keep pest numbers down. I strongly suggest you devote at least 10% of your space to attracting beneficial insects. That does not mean to simply plant flowers as you can still use the plants you grow as food. Borage is one well-known flowering herb, which both attracts dozens of beneficial insects, but you can also add the leaves and flowers to salads. A colourful way to bring pollinators is to grow a flower border consisting of herbs of the likes of margum, mint and borage, along with cornflowers and buckwheat. This will create a paradise for visiting bees, and why not create a movable paradise, for example planting in a bucket or a wheelbarrow and being able to move it around your garden. The fifth and final tip for growing organic vegetables is to get ahead of the game with weeds. As organic vegetable gardening is against the use of chemical weed sprays, it can only take a few weeks to get overrun by them. Weeds, unfortunately, will always outgrow vegetables. Originally, all vegetables were weeds, but after thousands of years of cultivation, they're weaker, therefore weeds will win the battle for space. But there are plenty of methods which will help you get that vital step ahead of the game. My personal favourite method is mulching, using up the abundance of free resources, for example leaves, cardboard and grass curpings, we can source from our own backyard, in the house or in your local park. This fall, collect leaves and in the spring you can use them to place in between the rows of plants, stopping light to hit the bare patches of ground and also adding nutrients as they slowly decompose. Add a 2 to 3 inch layer and repeats when you see weeds poking through. Another great mulch is wood chippings, which you can get for free or for a very cheap price at a local sawmill. Black plastic is a less aesthetically appealing method, however you get great results when we used it on our squashes and you can see that video by finding the link in the description.

I thank you very much for watching and I'll see you again soon in another video. Remember, don't panic and grow organic.
