 Innovation platforms are a way to bring people with different experiences together for common action. In this case they work together on natural resource management and improve livelihood. In Nile Basin Development Challenge, there are three action research locations. Jaldu, Fogara, and Dika. In innovation platforms we try to bring together three stakeholders. We have communities represented from each of the capabilities. There are university, research centers, development agents, and also some farmers. We set up these innovation platforms to build their own capacities. We try to minimize the gap that will improve their linkage, network, coordination. And we want them to learn one from each other. After we identified the different stakeholders, we established innovation platforms through sending them official letters. And they came to our first innovation platform. We briefed them about our objective in terms of innovation platforms, what we want to achieve with them. We brought an issue of what their roles could be. And together we have identified a term of reference. After we did the first, we came to the second innovation platform with the objective of identifying, prioritizing the main issues of rainwater management or natural resource management. Because the communities were not fully represented in our innovation platform members, we decided to do some community engagement activities. We did a focus group discussion. We did a participatory video in Fogara. Through all these engagement activities, we try to prioritize with communities what real issues they have on the ground. So after we bring what they have prioritized in each site to the innovation platforms, we present both side by side and try to prioritize from communities and as well as from experts. All sites have selected forage intervention as an entry point to deal with their big main issues, which is different in the three sites. If you take Digga, Digga is having a problem with thermites where these natural resource management are being damaged. The forage development was introduced because there are some forage species that resist also thermite infestation. In GEL2, we have land degradation. The highland is really degraded and the soil productivity is very less. If we introduce these forage developments, that will complement the current national campaign of soil and water conservation. So with that, we can improve something on land degradation. If you ask me about the Fogara case, the big issue is free grazing. Land is degraded, they are running out of forage, so that is direct implication in terms of our intervention. On each innovation platform meetings, we plan together for joint action in terms of when to plant, what kinds of forage trees we need to plant, and when, who is going to do what. They have also come up with some technical groups, who will follow up in between the regular innovation platform meetings. During planning, we try to do this actual research in small farmers, and they give them an awareness creation. If they are successful with these farmers, they are going to scale it up with other farmers. They will also promise them to demonstrate field days if they are going to be successful with this. There are a lot of problems that we encounter. The time that we had in the Nile Basin Development Challenge is too short, because innovation platform is set up not only for trying something out on the ground, but also with behavioral change. When you say platforms where there is no that kind of experience, they can't see the impacts that innovation platforms will bring to their world within a short period of time. The other is also, last year we faced a problem in terms of training and participatory approaches. So, we provide trainings for innovation platform members on innovation platform facilitation skills, and on participatory research methods. This year we devolve the roles and responsibilities to our local partners. They are managing the innovation platform meetings in a way that we can give them a good training, come up with a good lesson in one specific site with one issue, so that we can scale it up to other sites.
