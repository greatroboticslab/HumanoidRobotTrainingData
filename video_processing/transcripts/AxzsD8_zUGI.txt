 The University of Kentucky is launching a new beginner farmers training program alongside the Pike County Cooperative Extension Service. The program is designed to properly introduce new farmers to the agricultural industry and help them build their skills and network with other farmers. Best of all, it's completely free to those interested. This is a training program for brand new farmers. So if you're, you know, fresh out of college or, you know, they said it's good something for veterans or just anybody that's very new, interested in commercial farming. This is something that's an excellent opportunity. Lots of hands-on workshops help you with marketing, anything vegetable, small fruit production, livestock. It's excellent for new farmers, especially if you're within, you know, one to three years of just now beginning. This is an excellent opportunity for that kind of person. Journey into the extraordinary. Blast off from any of our three locations. Coal Run, Caney, or South Williamson. Hideaway. Novelty, smoke, and vape. Farmers will also receive one-on-one mentoring sessions so they can receive proper feedback. Applications are due February 1st. They're looking for someone who is focused and very serious about commercial farming. Anyone who is willing to put in the hours and put in the work and take advantage of this training program. Like I said, it's a wonderful opportunity for anybody that's willing to put in the hours and participate. They will provide one-on-one business marketing training, anything related to commercial production for vegetables or livestock. And they'll be taking field trips. You can go and mentor a farmer. Really, really help you get started and help you in farming. Reporting for Mountaintop News, I'm Nick Collum. Thank you.
