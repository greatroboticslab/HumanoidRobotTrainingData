 Hey everybody, welcome back to the channel. In today's video, we're going to be talking about purchasing land for your homestead. And I got three things that you need to look out for if you're a beginner, just starting out, trying to find your dream property. So let's get to it. All right, first thing I, hey, well, first of all, I'm back here in the back 40, as I call it. Um, back here where I do my hunting at, got my redneck blind back there. Um, this was something that was important to me, but we'll get to that in just a second. First, let's talk about location. All right. Location, location, location. For me, location meant, you know, I was in, uh, Washington state when I finished my military career and, um, that's growing zone eight. Well, it was eight, eight at the time. And, um, I felt like I love that growing zone. So I wanted to have my forever property in growing zone eight as well. So that was something that I looked for. I like growing zone eight because I can grow all year round. And it's, it's probably the, the zone that I think is most universal for being able to grow all year round. Um, the summers get hot, but they don't get as hot as nine and 10 and 11, you know? Um, but the winters are mild, so they don't get as cold as seven, you know, six and five and four. Um, so I have a really long growing season. I can definitely grow 365 days a year. Um, and that's something that was important to me. So that's why location, location, location is so important. So for me, uh, as far as location is concerned, that was really, that was really it. That was all that I was really concerned about. Um, but you know, some people may want to be close to family. Some people may not want to be close to family. You know what I mean? So, you know, I wanted to be, I guess you could say, uh, close enough that if I had to get home on an emergency, I can do it, but I'm far enough away where I ain't got to worry about somebody coming knocking on the dough, if you know what I mean. So, so location is super, super, super important. All right. So something that I, um, also had in mind was your local resources or your community. Um, I feel that for a homesteader, especially first starting off, you really need to, um, look at what's in your area that you can use. So, um, stuff like, like resources, like feed for your animals. So important, right? Um, I know most every place, you know, you got to attract a supplier, you got this, or you got to, you know, feed store or whatever, but, um, you know, look at those places and make sure that you have the type of place that you are going to make a long-term commitment to as far as, uh, uh, where you're going to be purchasing from because a lot of places just don't have the things that you may have had in your last, uh, location. So definitely, um, what, you know, look at what is in your community as far as resources, you know, can you get compost bulk, you know, or do you have to buy bag compost? Um, you know, bag compost gets expensive, you know, uh, but some people, you know, that's all they need. And so, you know, weigh your, weigh your, your needs and your wants and determine whether or not you're going to need stuff like, you know, bulk things that can be delivered to you because some places, Hey, I'm going to tell you, it's nice to live off grid. It's not, it's nice to, to not, um, have neighbors or whatever sometimes, you know, but sometimes it's nice to have a neighbor or two, you know, sometimes it's nice to be able to head out to the feed store and only have to drive, you know, 15, 20 minutes versus two hours to get feed for your animals. You know what I mean? So that's something that's very, very, very important and often overlooked is what you can, what you can locally just reach out and get in a, in a, in a pinch. Um, some things, yeah, you can plan it out and where you can get it delivered to you or whatever, but that's extra cost as well. So definitely your local resources is something that I highly recommend that you look into, especially if you're buying a property that you want to homestead on. Also, when you're looking at, uh, your local resources, you know, you, you want to make sure that you have access to agricultural resources as far as like NRCS or, um, your, your ag extensions and stuff like that. Um, make sure that, you know, cause like, let's take for instance, me, right? And, um, I'm not bad mouthing anybody or whatever. This is something that they told me, you know, so my county's, um, ag extension is not, doesn't have a lot of, uh, uh, resources I would say. And they have even pointed me to, you know, a sister County that has better resources because they have, uh, a UGA extension over there. So university of Georgia extension. So, um, it's a little further drive, you know, but it's not too, too bad, but that's something that I didn't know prior to buying this property versus, you know, my extension office is, you know, six, six to 10 minutes away, you know? So, um, definitely, um, you know, having to go and drive 30 minutes to the other extension office is not ideal. Um, it's probably not something that I would have, uh, like not bought the property over, but you know, you have to look into those kinds of things as well. And last but not least, um, the property condition. And so what I mean by that, there's a lot that goes into that. Um, like me, I knew I was going to be having gardens and whatnot, and I wanted to grow on this property. So I asked the, the seller, if I could do a soil test, they had no issue with me doing a soil test because they knew that they had, you know, premium soil here. I mean, this soil, they had horses here at one point and this soil is just, it's immaculate. I did a soil test and, um, it told me that I don't need to add anything to the soil, just grow in it, you know? So, um, you don't run into that too often. Not that I would have, uh, said, Hey, I'm not going to buy the property because of the soil test. Um, but I would like to know what I'm getting into, you know, from the soil test. The other thing that was really important to me was, you know, I want to be on well water. I don't want to be on city water. So, um, I made sure, and I, I saw that before I even came to the property that it was on well water. So well water was important to me. Um, it may not be important to you. So, but that is something because, you know, I don't have a water bill and I use a lot of water here on my property. So, um, that's something to definitely take into consideration when you're starting off homesteading, everything needs water, your animals, your plants, everything, you, everything needs water. So definitely don't overlook that. And if you can shave off a little bit of your monthly bill by having a well, or if you have the ability to dig a well, uh, because they dug a well here on the backside of the property and I have a well for the house as well. So, um, you know, that kind of thing is super, super important when you're talking about infrastructure for your animals. You know, if, if you want, you know, a ready-made place that already has barns and, and, uh, fencing and all that kind of stuff, that's something you need to be looking for. Don't overlook it. Don't think, oh, I could just build that later because you'll be four or five, six years later and you still don't have a fence. You know, I may be talking about myself, but, but no, uh, but something that I did not look at though, I would say this is a mistake that I made. Okay. So when I pulled up onto the property, uh, the house is kind of higher than the road, right? So, you know, and that's typical cause you want your grade to go away from the house. Um, and then when I came back here to the back, I noticed that everything slopes down back here and there's a, there's a, a river, not a river, but a Creek stream that runs through back there. Um, so, so I figured, okay, yeah, everything goes downhill toward, you know, water typically. And so I looked at it and I was like, okay, that's cool. That's, that's what I wanted. That's what I want, but something, you know, I looked at the soil, I looked at the slope, I looked at everything, you know, I liked the slope too. Cause I was like, man, so I don't have to worry about having one of those mud farms. You know what I'm saying? Cause you know, everybody, everybody talks about those mud farms, man. I didn't want one of those. So I was like, you know, being on a slope like this, the water's going to run off and I'm not going to have standing water. And I don't, you know, but I didn't think about why why the topography of my land was or is the way it is. I didn't think about that. And so, you know, you get to work in and you get to doing stuff. And next thing, you know, it's like, dang, everywhere I dig, there's rocks. And I got my yard, my front yard done. I got it leveled when I first moved here. And, um, you know, I, I had a company come in and kind of grade it. Cause I couldn't cut it. Cause there were so many rocks that were like, um, you know, I had to mow around rocks and stuff, you know? And so I was like, nah, man, I like to mow, you know, I like to mow my yard. So I was like, Hey, I need y'all to come in here and get these rocks out of here. And Hey, they got the rocks out. So, you know, I was like, all right, cool. So y'all got the rocks out, but he couldn't get it as level as I wanted it to be, you know? And so, uh, he was like, man, you got some huge rocks in this ground. And I was like, what? He was like, yeah, man, you got rocks so big that like, you probably need dynamite to like, to like dislodge them. You know, he said, you probably, your house is probably sitting on a big rock, you know? And I was like, ah, so right around the street, the, um, the, uh, the next little town over or whatever, it's not really a town. It's just, it don't really have nothing over there, but, um, it's called the rock, the rock, Georgia, you know? So, so it makes sense, you know, and as you're driving by and you see other people's houses and stuff, you see a lot of rocks, like big rocks in their yards, you know, whatnot. So that's something that I did not take into consideration. So when I'm making my gardens and whatnot, I tend to hit rocks and I don't mean just little rocks. I mean, big boulders that I hit that I have to either grow around, try to dig up some of them I've been able to dig up, but I mean, I got rocks that are like, you know, big, biggest people, you know what I mean? So like you can't just dig those things up, especially with me. I don't have any, um, equipment like that. I just have my hands, my shovel and whatnot to get that kind of stuff up. So I'm able to get some of them up, but for the most part, they, I have to work around them, you know? So, um, that is definitely something that I was like, okay, yeah, I, I messed up when it came to that. Now, if I had known that, would I have still purchased the property? Yes. Yes, I would. I love this property. I mean, I absolutely love it. It has a, a healing feeling to it. And I don't know if you understand what I mean by that, but it, it's the type of place that when you come to it, you just get, uh, amazing energy from it. And man, it seems like everything that I do here like succeeds, you know? So, um, yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't trade this property for anything. What I am going to do, um, eventually is my, my, uh, stand is going to be moved to a different property, um, probably in the next three or four years, uh, where I will have a hunting property. And then I can change everything back here to growing. I'm already growing my, um, orchard back there. I can also grow, you know, corn or, you know, wheat or something back there as well. So that's my three things that I think that, um, you know, every beginner homesteader that's looking to purchase property really needs to be looking at, um, the location, the amenities or the resources around that location and the condition of the property. Um, you may even be looking at those things. And like me, I was looking at the soil, you know, I was checking the soil out. I was checking out the conditions, the, the topography of the, of the land, but I didn't take into consideration the big old rocks that they have here. And I mean, when you're doing anything, you putting up posts, you doing anything, anything you have to dig into the ground. Um, it's tough when you got big boulders that you have to deal with. Uh, but the good thing about rocks is if you get one that's deep enough, it's a good support, you know, so you can, you can put a post on top of it and you know, that post is never going to sink. So you, you can use it for, for good, you know, um, or, uh, find the good in it, I guess you could say, but Hey, that's my three tips. That's the three things that I think that you really need to focus on. Um, Hey, if I missed anything, definitely get down in the comments, let me know. Uh, you know, if you're a seasoned homesteader and you, maybe you've bought a couple of properties or whatnot, definitely let me know if there were some things that you would have added in to this list. Um, obviously it's a short list, just three items, but within those three items, I think there's a lot, there's a lot to, uh, unpack in those three, uh, categories that, that I, um, those three categories that I feel are very, very, very important to the, uh, beginning homesteader. All right. Well, that's it. I really appreciate you guys, uh, hanging in there with me and, um, Hey, make sure you do all the YouTube stuff.
