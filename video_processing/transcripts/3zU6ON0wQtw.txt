We don't know why they're all doing great ever since we've had them. Gina of last night was like, hey I think one of the turkeys is dead. I'm like, what? I was just down there and they were all fine. So, keep our fingers crossed that we don't lose any more. I only wanted two turkeys and I got four because I know turkeys can be very finicky when you're raising them as babies. And then once they get bigger and feathered out, they're very hardy. It's just at this stage, they're not. Which is odd. I had to pick up some grain while I was out tonight. Afternoon girls.

You're a crazy dog. Nope, we're not going over there. When I'm working with an oil finish, I like to store everything outside and in a sealed bag afterwards. Believe it or not, when I apply oil finishes to furniture, when I worked at the furniture company, I have seen spontaneous combustion on oil-soaked bags that were outside in a bucket and the bucket was in the sun. They get so hot and they just got on fire. So, Gina made a nice, delicious, meatloaf yesterday and I just need to put it into the oven and bake it for dinner tonight. It's made with ground pork from our pigs that we've raised this winter. And yes, it's got ketchup topping. It's got ketchup. This is a little fun because it's, I'm probably saying it's split in half.
