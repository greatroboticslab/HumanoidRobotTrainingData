We ended up losing one of the turkeys. We don't know why. They're all doing great. Ever since we've had them, Gina of last night was like, hey, I think one of the turkeys did. I'm like, what? I was just down there and they were all fine. So, keep our fingers crossed that we don't lose any more. I only wanted two turkeys and I got four because I know turkeys can be very finicky when you're raising them as babies. And then once they get bigger and feathered out, they're very hardy. It's just at this stage, they're not, which is odd. I had to pick up some grain while I was out tonight. I had to pick up some grain. I had to pick up some grain. I had to pick up some grain.

Believe it or not, when I applied oil finishes to furniture when I worked at the furniture company, I have seen spontaneous combustion on oil-soaked rags that were outside in a bucket and the bucket was in the sun. They get so hot and they just got on fire. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Gina made a nice, delicious meatloaf yesterday.
