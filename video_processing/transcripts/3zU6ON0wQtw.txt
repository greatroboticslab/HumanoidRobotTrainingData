We got it all built and I'm trying to think about what I want to finish it with. And we're going to go to our, what we always trust and use is tongue oil and mineral spirits. Did you want to talk about this establishment? I think it's time. We feed Sam Hassan, Adam, Rad. Let's go. So We ended up losing one of the turkeys. We don't know why, they're all doing great ever since we've had them. Gina of last night was like, hey I think one of the turkeys did. I'm like, what? I was just down there and they were all fine. So keep our fingers crossed that we don't lose any more. I only wanted two turkeys and I got four because I know turkeys can be very finicky when you're raising them as babies. And then once they get bigger and feathered out, they're very hardy. It's just at this stage, they're not, which is odd. I had to pick up some grain while I was out today.

You're a crazy dog. Nope, we're not going over there. When I'm working with an oil finish, I like to store everything outside and in a sealed bag afterwards. Believe it or not, when I applied oil finishes to furniture, when I worked at the furniture company, I have seen spontaneous combustion on oil-soaked rags that were outside in a bucket, and the bucket was in the sun. They get so hot, and they just got on fire. Okay. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.
