 Nolan sculpturesrhiz Christmas Saturn Cars Saturn Rice is an important staple of Southeast Asian diets. Actually, the farmer has different rice varieties. They use their own farm sales seeds, which is, we don't know the name, but we just call from one to another farmer, but duration more than 100 days, so farmers can just grow only one cycle. Cambodia has relied on a few traditional varieties that take longer to mature. To improve yields, the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI, has developed a new variety for Cambodian farmers. This rice has been engineered to withstand droughts. Additionally, its shorter growth cycle means farmers can plant and harvest three times in a growing season, improving output by 33%. So it is a CA15 variety, which is the short duration variety, and its duration is about three months. So it is a very good variety because it's not a good variety and not, you know, it's a photo, it's non-photo-pheret sensitive, which means that it can grow any time of the year, and also it takes short duration, and so that it can save a lot of water. In the Mekong River Delta, which is the major rice producing area, 90% of what is produced in that region is exported, and this is exported to Philippines, to Indonesia, and to African countries. Many of the rice importing countries. So it's very, that's why its role in the regional food security in Southeast Asia is very important. If something happens in that region, many countries will be affected when it comes to food security. Rice farmer income has increased by 55%. A significant benefit for Cambodia's women farmers. Actually, we are working to promote the rice variety, which is mainly stress to the drought, flood, and also pest problems. And usually the variety that's been used by farmers, which is very long duration, and low yield, and also the quality is not so good. But the variety that we have just recently released, is very, yield very good, and also very short duration. And farmers are very willing to get it, because obviously the crop very much to learn to drought, and especially also to any pest problem like brown plant hopper. Innovations like this are helping farmers earn more income and feed their families, an important step to reducing poverty and improving food security. So, we'll see you next time. We'll see you next time. Bye.
