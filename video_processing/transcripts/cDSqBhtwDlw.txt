 Winter is coming. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Like she said, winter is coming. So it means we got to get everything ready. It's coming. Yeah. So it's going to be in the single digits around here. Um, this coming this weekend. So we're going to get all the animals outfitted with heat lamps and fresh straw to lay on. Puppy dogs love their straw. Uh, turkeys will be brought, uh, well, they're, they're, well, they're, they're pretty good. They're pretty good. So, um, we'll just need to make sure that their water doesn't freeze or nothing. Can I go off and play? Sure. You can go off and play. We're going to clean out the brooder side of the barn. Let the turkeys hole up in there for a little bit. We'll make sure that the, uh, the bees don't need anything, which they, they look like they're doing pretty good. Like they look like they got themselves all sealed up real tight. So we're going to move the chickens water inside. They can come out and get water, but they're not going to want to, we're going to let them, we're going to open the door for them to come out every day. But usually they just like to hang around their, uh, their heat source until things go back to kind of like it is now in the thirties to forties. That's kind of where they're at. The main thing with chickens is just making sure that they're, uh, they have an, uh, if they get wet, they have the ability to dry themselves off and they don't stay wet because their combs will get frostbite like that. And, uh, then you'll get infection and they'll start walking around with brain worms and everything and just not acting right. Hey, why don't you like and subscribe?
