The Kenyan tomato industry. Kenyan tomatoes, most of them are sold in the market, though there is a small portion absorbed by the industry. And therefore, it is the mass market that determines the overall prices that farmers earn. Now tomato prices in Kenya can be determined by whether, supply, demand and most of all, the broker's will and greed. How much brokers want is what the farmer will sell simply because he cannot sell his own produce. And therefore, the inability of most farmers to access market is what has empowered merciless brokers who will never farm but are eat the biggest pie of the tomato production. Selling tomatoes in collograms, especially as how industries absorb, is the most profitable way for farmers. However, brokers prefer using exploitative units of measure, such as hipcrate or provox, to earn abnormal profits. The best time that you can plant tomatoes in Kenya. The perfect time that you can get good prices at low cost is one that coincides with low market supply. Yes. The best time that you can plant all of these crops in Kenya.

Remember, tomato demand is always there. People will still continue consuming tomatoes regardless of the weather. Where can you grow tomatoes? The best place to grow tomatoes is one that has fertile, well-drained soil and warm weather. Warm weather hastens and fastens the tomato growth. At low cost, especially when it comes to controlling fungal diseases caused by cold weather. Doing outdoor tomatoes in wet cold regions increases the cost of production, especially in controlling diseases compared to doing it in weather in warm weather regions. The greenhouse system is ideal in both hot and cold regions as it enables faster growth of crops. The most profitable high yielding tomato varieties to grow in Kenya. In order to make money in tomato farming, you must select the best tomato variety with faster maturity, high yield and good tolerance to diseases. All tomato varieties are not the same. They vary in terms of yield and resistance to diseases. The best two varieties that you can plant and get good high yields is Terminator F1 from Royal Seeds and also F1 from Seminis. These are the best and most profitable outdoor tomatoes to grow in Kenya. For greenhouse farmers, Susanna F1 has good shape, good size and therefore makes it the best tomato variety to plant inside greenhouse. It is a product of Royal Seeds. Now, let's check what makes Terminator F1 a good variety. One, it is a very vigorous plant, long, determinate and a heavy yield. Name are a bad którą wasują stocks in 2007-2012. Likeminar之後, this growing exp Ganze is étude Dani Mercki, gave a future história .

terminator f1 has a 21 day shelf life a leaker can hold a plant population of around 8 000 plants of terminator another cool variety that you can do is answer f1 from seminis it is elongated square loud tomato hybrid it's best for open field environmental condition it brings value to growers with overall fruit quality disease package extended shelf life and plant yield after getting the best variety how do you plant it here is how you can plant good metal in outdoor farming dig planting holes on a spacing of 60 centimeters by 60 centimeters or 60 centimeters by 50 centimeters but for greenhouse farming you can do 50 centimeters by 50 centimeters simply because you will do the pruning after that apply well decomposed manure 2 kg precisely per planting hole cover with loose soil and water then drench with thunder insect site to kill any cat worms and city shooter optimizer for removing any transplanting stress on the crop after that you can transplant your seedlings in large-scale farming sourcing seedlings is economical however for small-scale farmers raising your own seedlings is most economic and the variety is guaranteed even for large-scale farmers if you can manage to raise your own seedlings it's very very economical and also the variety is guaranteed we've experienced several cases where farmers they ordered or outsourced seed drinks but they were not the variety that they were promised giving farmers roses and remember you could only realize this few months down the line and it's irreversible there's nothing much you can do raising on seedlings is guaranteed of quality and variety after you've planted your tomatoes the next thing is feeding feeding is what determines the yield regardless of the variety if you have a good variety and you don't feed it well you'll definitely experience low yields here is the tomato fertilizer application schedule the fertilizer that you need to apply how and even the quantity top dress with the dap npk 1717 s can fertilizers on the 14th day after transplanting 45th day after transplanting and 16th days after transplanting respectively what do i mean i mean during planting you don't apply the dap two weeks after your seedlings have developed you can now come and apply the dap at this time the seedlings will have developed the root hairs and manage to absorb the fertilizer if you applied during the planting it may be easily reached away and not end up helping the crop after that 45 days equivalent to one and a half month after transplanting you can now apply npk 17 17 17 17 it has the balance nitrogen phosphorus and potassium this will initiate fruiting and flowering so you don't skip this one and go to cn no this one will initiate fruiting and flowering and give you high number of fruits and flowers after that then two months after transplanting you can apply now the cn fertilizer cn has the calcium that will help in the expansion of the fruit and that's why we usually recommend it to be done 60 days after transplanting you can supplement this fertilization by applying nitrogen foliar fertilizers such as you can apply is the grow vegetative on the first month that is two weeks after transplanting and your top dressing every week you do is a grow vegetative to enhance foliar growth on the second month after transplanting now you apply the npk foliar such as wogzo and also advanced k this one has more potassium and it will help in fruiting and flowering on the third month you can now apply calcium rich foliar fertilizers to prevent blossom end rot and also these calcium boron foliars they will prevent in fruit and flower abortion after that we're gonna look at the worst tomato paste and how to control them imagine after selecting the best variety feeding then now what kicks out of tomato farming it's past diseases we are not going to allow this and that's why we are now giving you the worst of all and the best chemicals you can use and how you can manage to apply them the number one best that has run most farmers out of business is tuta absoluta or what we call leaf miner it's the most destructive best in tomato farming due to its infectiveness to most chemicals caused by insects nature of damage actually it tends to hibernate between the layers of the leaves so that when you apply the chemicals they are much not effective to identify with them very easily you can see some marks are still a kind of snail passing by we often call them blood-shaped mines on the leaves clearly you find them on stems but you can also find them there the best control for tutor absoluta is applying the best chemicals early so you can apply belt for a male the rate of for a male in 20 liters of water or a male in 20 liters of water these applications should be done from the third week after transplanting and you continue at least weekly weekly weekly and when you apply you apply all the leaves below the leaves and also on the soil okay why do we apply on the soil so that we can manage to kill all the eggs laid on the soil below the leaves you need to control it and also on top control when you do this you will manage to have a total control before it reaches the worst stage right like a fly remember it goes the whole metamorphosis so if you don't control that before becoming a an insect it will be hard and this is what has caused most farmers low yields you find fruits they have made some holes and buyers don't also want to bite them no one wants to buy a tomato with walls made of insects so the best way ensure that you you can use bed for a male per 20 liters of water or emerald 10 a male per 20 liters of water and apply early there is no shortcut about it the next insight that has caused total destruction in crops and especially in greenhouse farmers it's white fries this one has drained most farmers white fries they are white star sucking insects and by doing so they tend to promote growth of the sweetly mold kind of restricted honeydew they cause the regular ripening of tomatoes and can also transmit viral pathogens like the tomato yellow leaf curl virus to identify them you just need to shake shake the plants a little bit and you'll see white flying insects alone to control them apply profile at 30 ml per 20 liters of water or also emerald 10 ml per 20 liters of water the application if it's on greenhouses should be done on the midday if it's on the farm it should be done on the evening you apply around the farm and then you apply inside not inside then you finish with around no spraying fast around the farm contains them and makes them easy to be killed after controlling the pests the next thing you need to watch out is the tomato diseases here is how you can control them early the most destructive tomato disease is bright often known as balidi ama kuchomeka this one has drained a lot of farmers and kicked them out out of tomato farming business tomato early bright is a disease characterized by brown spot with dark concentric trinks the disease spreads rapidly affecting the leaves and the stem and finally it affects the fruits the fruits of the plants to control it to control it apply mystery 72 wp at the rate of that grams per 20 liters of water or redomilic gold at the rate of 50 grams per 20 liters of water the best way to control them is early application once they are affected it becomes very very hard remember the cells of the plant die so and you cannot manage to revive them and therefore the best way is to prevent early when you've seen little infestation you can first apply copper based fungicide such as the green cop or lisa cop and then after that you now continue applying the normal fungicides but most of all is ensuring that you've prevented the infestation and the best application rate is applying twice per week in cold seasons or heavy late season or once per week in hot seasons the next disease that has destroyed a lot of tomatoes is tomato yellow leaf spot disease you find the leaves has black spots okay the bright and sports disease are different for sport disease you find spots evenly distributed on the leaves but for blight you'll find along the margins as if they are starting to dry it's that it starts by affecting older leaves with greenish yellow spots begging from the top of the leaf progressively the spots become dark with infected blossoms also turning black and falling off the disease it also affects fruits for effective control you can apply either trinity gold at the rate of 50 grams per 20 liters of water or you can also apply the score yes at trees at the rate of 20 ml per 20 liters of water and these two will help in total control of this spot these spots these spots and bright these are the worst diseases that will kick you out of tomato famine imagine all that investment and this is where you come to or after all that investment and then you let just because of the carelessness you let your crops be destroyed by this best the tutor and also the white flies actually we don't expect any farmer listening to this tutorial to be ever again stressed by this disease we've given you total control and after you've done this now let's do the math how much are you willing or highly likely to make and how much are you highly likely to incur the cost and profit of tomato farming in kenya the cost of tomato production in kenya is 185 000 kenyan shillings and you can find all these maths on our previous article which you can click here above this is often various with season location and management and management and a good management and a good management a neka can produce 300 crates if a farmer sales if a farmer sales one crate at around 1000 shillings then he earns 300 000 shillings from 300 crates in one neka this gives him a profit of around 115 000 however if he does sell the similar crates below 800 500 and even as it was in some months past at 300 shillings per crate the farmer definitely make losses so therefore the best means that you can manage to get good profit is selling your yield above 1000 shillings per crate at least this way you'll get some good profit the best way to make sure you can manage to make sure you can manage your crop in the market remember we promised as we begin to give you the bonus tips we have the very bonus tips how you can increase yield

diseases once you do that you will definitely increase your yield the next one on speeding the tomato growth ensure that you've planted in warm areas ensure that you water very well and you feed them promptly and by feeding i mean giving them the light fertilizer at the right time note that you are giving the dap two months or you are applying cn at the beginning those ones will not give you the good results the bad one how do you get your tomatoes to produce more fruits one you can display high potassium foliar fertilizers such as the advanced k this one will enhance flowering and fruiting and don't forget to combine it with boron boron will prevent the formed fruits and flowering from aborting and the bad thing don't forget to add calcium it will prevent the blossom end rot that's how

definitely get good margins but if you have low yields and you get low prices you end up making losses and in tomato farming there is no shortcuts there is no shortcut you cannot plant an opv variety and you expect 40 tons you cannot deny the crop cn or npk and you expect good plant you cannot keep weekly spraying of chemicals to control to tabs or uta white fries bright yellow spots black black spots you cannot skip that chemical application and you expect good yields it doesn't happen like that you have to be consistent consistent don't forget also to like to subscribe and to share see you
