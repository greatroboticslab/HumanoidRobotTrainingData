 But on Mars, with only 38% of Earth's gravity, water behaves differently. The irrigation systems must be carefully designed to deliver water directly to the roots, without flooding the soil or allowing water to evaporate too quickly. In Mars' low gravity, water doesn't flow the same way. To overcome this, SpaceX has developed a system that delivers precisely controlled amounts of water directly to the plant's roots. This drip irrigation system ensures that the crops receive exactly the amount of water they need, no more, no less. The water is then recycled, filtered, and reused, creating a closed-loop system that maximizes efficiency.
