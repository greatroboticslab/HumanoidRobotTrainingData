 Morning YouTube, Old School Farmer here. And today, I'm going to be showing you how to drive a tractor. This is a John Deere 5400. It doesn't really matter the different style tractors. I mean, you'll have some variations in controls. But, basically you have your basics. Brakes, clutch, foot throttle on some tractors, not all tractors. Hand throttle, hydraulics. Right now they're locked, but we won't move those. You got your shifter. Sometimes they're H-patterns. Sometimes they're dual H-patterns. That's if you don't have one of these. This is your high-low shifter ABC. This is 1, 2, 3, reverse, and park. Park axis neutral. There's no actual park gear on some tractors. It's just a parking brake. This is also your three-point. And your float, which I have a video on the float if you want to go check that out. Here's your PTO lever. And here's your electronics. This is my addition to this tractor, and this is not factory. Okay, this is your turn signal. Flashers, brights. Flashers, high beams. Flashers, low beams. Flashers. Okay. So, to start a tractor, on most tractors, you just push clutch in. Push brake in. Pushing brake in is recommended. Turn the key on. On diesels, you wait a little bit for some glow plug action. Gasoline, you just start it with the choke. There you go. Now it's started. You let the clutch out and let it warm up. It doesn't seem to want to warm up, so you're okay. Yep. Okay, so you're okay to push clutch in. Push brake in. Over here. Pull out. That's how to park. Come on, shift. There it goes. Now it's in first. To let off of, or to get going, keep your foot on the brake. Let the clutch out. Let out on the brake. And then slowly let off the clutch. The stop. You push the clutch in. We're still moving. Then you push the brake in. That stops you. Now if you're on a flat surface, make sure you're in neutral. And... Hear that? That's clutch engaging. You can let off the clutch if you're in neutral. Make sure you don't shift into gear while it's out of... Oh boy. Now to get this back into gear... On most tractors, you have to push the clutch in... And wait so that it stops spinning the transmission. And then you can put it into gear. Sometimes it argues. There it goes. So that is a quick tutorial on how to draw your tractor.
