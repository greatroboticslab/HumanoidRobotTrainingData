 We just got this basil plant from the supermarket but you know what? There's just so much to it that meets the eye. Each one of these tiny stems will become its own plants. Let's see how we can do this. Carefully take the plants out of the pot. Gently tease apart the roots so you don't damage the plants. Repot each stem. One pot of basil turn into 12 individual healthy plants. From one pot of basil to 12 plants.
