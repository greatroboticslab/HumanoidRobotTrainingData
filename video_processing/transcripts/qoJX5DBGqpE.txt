 Innovations in plant breeding are speeding up the rate that better crop varieties can be developed to reduce global hunger. For nearly a hundred years, gamma rays have been used to safely induce mutations and enhance the genetic diversity of crops like barley or quinoa. Mutation breeding has already developed thousands of improved crop varieties with valuable traits for farmers such as resistance to disease or tolerance to drought. Nuclear scientists are now taking a new approach using genetic markers to find the chosen mutant trait so that breeders don't have to grow several generations to find out if a plant has the desired mutation. It's something that can accelerate and enhance the impact of mutation breeding. The goal is to be able to quickly identify a positive trait in a mutant plant and then introduce that trait in other varieties. What we hope to say to the member states in the future is first of all that we'll have a toolkit that allows to introduce traits that they're interested in into their locally adapted varieties. And then equally important I think that we can provide the trainings on how to do it themselves in the future. Thanks so much so much thanks for joining us.
