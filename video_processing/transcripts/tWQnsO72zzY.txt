 Hello, so Eric here. Today we came to Kojo Chrome, or is that the... Otu Kwejo. Otu Kwejo, within the Nsanwem suburb, for us to come and survey a new field that one of our clients want to put to use. After surveying it, we'll be able to choose the particular crop. But key among them was to know the history of the land, what they've used it for over a period of time, where we are going to source water. Of course, to also make sure the land belongs to them. And thankfully, they came to meet their neighbors in order to make sure everything aligned with each other. And also one of their threats, even before we started, is cattle invasion. They usually see a lot of cattle. The land has been used from 2012, and then they went on a pause, cultivating some crops like tomatoes, okra, and what have you. And you also do cassava. The farm owners are here. And then we have key trees like palm tree, one of them, some few coconuts, about 80 acres. So from here, you can't see all of them. But just to give you a very close shot and a good view, the land is good. We have some part that is a little slopey, and then some part that is very flat when you go uphill. The intention, of course, is to construct a mini-damp that will serve during the dry season, if possible. During the rainy season, we accumulate water, and then during the dry season, it will be sustainable. And surely, we are able to supply or produce throughout the entire season. This is what we do. We start with you from the world go. We come to see the realities on ground. Then we are able to prepare a well-customized budget for your case. And we all say, we will not touch your money. We will let you spend the money as we go. We are just a guide who are guiding you through where to pick items that you are needed, the basic quality standards, in order to make your investment a good deal for you. Thank you, and see you again. Thank you.
