 Howdy folks this is Coleman Alderson for gardensall.com and today I'm here to share with you our harvest of our Romanian red garlic and we'll put up some information on that in an article pertaining to harvesting garlic it's a perfect time this is May 20th thereabouts and we just pulled this one out of the ground I want to show you a little bit of its anatomy of course you have the garlic bulb here this is a Romanian red variety by the way rather spicy well known for its intense flavor and it's it's heat it's it's good in a lot of dishes and we'll be posting some recipes on how to use it but we have the the bulb we have the roots down here nice healthy set roots these were set out in November went through the winter just fine and now we have this we have a hard neck right here it's the hard neck garlic and what's really interesting is these these leaves you have just regular flat sort of leaves and then as the season rolls on and gets warmer you get the these these things called scapes and this is a kind of a snake like thing that comes up it's different than the regular leaves it's it's like part of the stem actually and this is an especially long one but scapes are great they're one of the first things you can go ahead and cut off your plant before you even pull it out of the ground and take it in and use it in all kinds of recipes that we'll tell you about but that's part of the the curing process I'll be cutting the scape off and then hanging this up to cure for two weeks or so in the shade it's really important you don't lay it out in the sun but nice air flow and nice shade so it isn't exposed to the Sun and you don't have to clean it off very much just let it dangle there and we use a fence basically a plastic fence that we used to use to keep the dogs out of the garden but it works really well we put it on a slight frame so it will hold its position then we hang it up under the eaves of some of our buildings here and it works really good dries them out and in about two weeks they'll be ready to trim up take inside so this is Coleman Alderson for gardensall.com I hope you all are having fun if you're planting garlic yourselves let us know write in your comments on our channel here subscribe to us if you will and also check out our alert by hitting that little bell up there and we will be sending you all kinds of updates on what's happening but especially if you had some great experiences or maybe not so great experiences in growing garlic we'd love to hear from you that's it Coleman Alderson for gardensall.com thank you howdy folks I'm back with you here in our shady location under an eve of one of our storage buildings and what I constructed here was a very simple frame using this kind of plastic fencing that is stretched across a rectangular frame and then hung from inside the eaves here and this is an ideal location we got good airflow we have nice shade sun is barely ever even touching this area and it'll take about two weeks to have this cure out right so I want to show you what what we do here with each plant first thing I'm going to do is cut out this scape which is a kind of a serpentine like creature that grows in the within the leaves usually coming out near the top of the garlic plant and you can cut these before you even harvest the plants they're really delicious you can think of them in terms of stir fry mixing them in with flavoring anything that you might use a green onion for it has a little bit extra zap because it is a garlic flavor so similar to the garlic chives but because this is a Romanian red it has a quality about it that is kind of spicy so that's the first thing we do and then we want to weave this top part of the plant into the fabric of the fence picking out one of the squares to push the leaves up through and try to weave it up through it and to make it easier what we can do is start the top and just do a little fold here and there's no science to this I'm just picking an arbitrary spot here and then kind of meshing it up together so it will go through the um through the grid here and then you just take it and start at a place where you want your bulb to hang somewhere within the frame if you can and these are tough leaves but I'm weaving them through the uh I'm going to go every other square a little better that way and then you got to push it up through see how this is working here and we'll go up through here again and after you get through about two of these you really don't have to worry about doing it much more it'll it'll take care of itself okay all right so we have our garlic push up a little more our garlic bulb hanging here and the leaves will feed a little bit more nutrition to it and as it cures out in two weeks it'll be ready to go up here's the old stem from from the uh escape kind of tough okay and then you can trim it up but uh we'll be back here in two weeks to check it out and here we have a completed panel of our garlic curing now for 14 days thanks very much for watching folks colman alderson for gardensall.com
