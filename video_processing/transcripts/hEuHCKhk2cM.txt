Howto & Style
 What are the different types of sprinklers? Well, there's a few of them out there. Let's talk about the most common ones. I'm Dwayne Smith, your sprinkler warehouse product specialist. Let's get started. Let's start off with rotors, sprays, and rotary nozzles since those three are the most frequently used in residential landscapes. These three come in pop-ups and shrub versions. So a pop-up is a sprinkler head that hides below the surface of the soil and pops up when it's time to water. Whether it's a rotor or a spray body, they both have a spring which keeps the sprinkler collapsed until a valve in the zone opens and the water pressure pushes up the riser. Shrub versions don't pop up and are installed on shrub sticks. Rotors have gears inside the body that rotate this turret on top. It sprays out a stream of water that rotates. There are partial circle rotors that rotate from something like 45 degrees to 360, depending on the brand and model. And there are 360 degree only rotors that just go round and round in a circle. Pop-up heights for rotors are most frequently 4-inch, 6 and 12-inch also, with 4-inch by being by far the most common. And there are also the shrub models. Rotors are usually used to water lawns. 4-inch is great for most grass lawns. 6 and 12-inch varieties are often used for other types of ground cover. And as I mentioned before, there are shrub style rotors. They're put on shrub sticks and they should only be located where no one will trip on them. They're primarily placed in flower beds behind larger plants and shrubs. So this is a spray body. And this is a spray head. Although they're used fairly interchangeably, it's both a body and a head. I don't know what that is. Sprays emit water in kind of a fan shape. Spray heads come in a variety of pop-up heights. It's the most common being 2, 4, 6, and 12-inch pop-ups. And also shrub models. While rotors are usually used for lawns, sprays are more commonly used for flower beds. Spray bodies often are purchased separately from the nozzles, although you can buy some already put together. There are a large variety of nozzles to meet your every need. Nozzles come in various spray patterns anywhere from a 45-degree arc to a full 360-degree arc. There's some that have adjustable arcs, and there's some strip patterns that are meant for little slivers of grass or plant beds. Spray nozzles come in various spray distances. That's called the radius, by the way, the distance a sprayer or rotor throws water. A shrub-style spray body is basically just an adapter that attaches a nozzle to a shrub stick. Rotary nozzles use moving fingers of water to irrigate your landscape. They are very water-efficient. Rotary nozzles fit the very same pop-up bodies as spray nozzles. You can buy them separately from the bodies or already installed on the pop-up body for you. Like sprays, they come in a large variety of distances and shapes, including some strip patterns as well. Both sprays and rotary nozzles tend to use less water than rotors. Rotors are more of a powerhouse covering large distances and areas. They have a larger radius than most sprays, usually 17 feet or more. They need more water pressure, ideally around 45 psi. Sprays need less water pressure, 30 psi is optimal. In fact, too much water pressure will cause them to mist. So if water pressure is too high, you can buy spray bodies that have pressure-regulating stem. And in some states, you're required to, by law, buy sprays with pressure-regulating stems. Rotary nozzles operate optimally around 40 to 45 psi. And they have throw distances anywhere from 8 to 24 feet. Next up, impacts. These are kind of old-fashioned sprinklers. They were invented in 1933, so they've been around a while. They are a type of rotor. They turn as they spray. Impacts are noisier than the gear-driven rotors that I showed you before. They throw water farther, and they tend to use a lot of water. The inside of an impact is just a tube, which means that there are no gears to clog up. So impacts are better for you when the water source is something like a pond or a well. They're used a lot in agriculture because you can get the brass ones like this, which tend to be really sturdy. I've seen them used in nurseries, and they're used in some places to keep dust down like horse arenas. And there are pop-up versions like this. Flood bubblers pour water out onto the ground in a pretty tight radius, 18 inches or less. In fact, some just kind of drool down whatever they're attached to. They put water in a confined space really quickly, creating a puddle. One of their uses is inside of a watering basin to saturate the soil for newly planted trees. They can be used for shrubs or ground covers in the right situations, and they're used in locations where you really want to avoid overspray, like next to floor-to-ceiling windows. Hose-end sprinklers are a possible solution if you just need some spot watering in certain areas and don't want to install a sprinkler system. If you do use hose-end sprinklers, a hose-end timer can help you water consistently by turning on and off the water on a schedule. Or you can just set the timer to run a specified amount of time so you don't have to worry about forgetting that you left the water running. In the not-quite-sprinkler category, there are a variety of sprays, jets, and emitters that work with a drip system. Drip systems use a lot less water and lower water pressure to deliver water more directly to plants to avoid watering areas that you don't need. They use different tubing and connectors than a typical sprinkler system, although they can be tied into a regular sprinkler system on a separate zone. So there's spike bubblers, drip emitters, jets, sprays, and all kinds of interesting solutions. There's also misters and foggers, and there's sprinklers that hang upside down, which have applications in greenhouses. And that's not all. But that's all I'm going to cover today. There are other specialty items that we don't need to get into for this video, but we covered the basics. There are a variety of other videos we have on sprinklers that are more in-depth and can help you make a decision on what you need for your landscape project. So go check those out. Questions?
