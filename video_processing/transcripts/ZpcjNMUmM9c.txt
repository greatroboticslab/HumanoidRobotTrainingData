 Let's say you have a massive amount of water, and you have a bunch of different pipes, and you need to get that up real up. But of course, you don't want to put a bunch of pumps over here because that will be a waste of resource. Well, there's one cool trick. Just utilize something called a water tower. All you got to do is take a water extractor, a bunch of different pumps, and pump that one line all the way to the top. Once it gets to the floor that you need it to go to, all you're going to do is you're going to bring it straight down. Now that it's on the original floor that you need it to be on, what you're going to do is you're going to take it to your water plant. Then you're going to take the pump and put it all the way to the end of the system. This is going to push this pump all the way to the top. But what about the rest of them? All you got to do is just hook it over to the next one, and then hook that one to the next one, then hook that one to the next one. And soon this massive water pump plant is going up, up, and away with only one, two, or three pumps, depending on how tall you're going.
