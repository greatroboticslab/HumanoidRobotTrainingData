Howto & Style
 Things I wanted to talk about today are how to get started in homesteading and self-sufficiency. You can't really just jump in and expect things to work. It just does not work that way. So I wanted to do this series kind of like some tips. How I got started. Not only in homesteading and self-sufficiency. There's some light. But basically how to become debt free in about six years. It's taken me, you know, it could take you longer, it could take you shorter. But when I started I had a plan and that plan is what is crucial. And let me kind of back you up to the beginning. And hopefully that will help you. So I bought property, a house with some land. With the intentions of eventually homesteading and becoming self-sufficient. And also becoming debt free. And when I bought the land it was never a homestead before. It was actually a vacation home. The guy had owned it for 20 years. It's on a lake. And basically they come out and spend a weekend or two a year. And for the most time it was not lived in. And they mowed the grass and that's really about all they really ever did. And actually according to some of the neighbors they didn't really mow the grass that often either. But I was neither here nor there. So things that I think are crucial to allowing me to get to where I'm at in such a quick manner. Are that first when I bought the house I did not do anything at all for the first year. And that was unintentional. Because I wanted to walk the property and keep an eye on what was in bloom. And what I was seeing for the first year. Because it changes as the seasons change. You know everything else changes also. And I was trying to also put together an idea of like where I wanted to have chicken coop. And where I wanted to have goats. And where I was going to put rabbits. And where the garden was going to be at. And you know all these things. And my original plans had to change. Because during that first year I found like nut trees that had I just acted on a whim. And did what I wanted to do from the start without taking that year break. And paying attention. I would have cut down nut trees that are a natural source of you know food. I would have cut down wild blueberries and blackberries that are also a source of food. You know I probably get a gallon or more of blueberries and blackberries from the wild plants. Not counting what I've planted myself. In the nuts. And there were some fruit trees. Three different mulberry trees that you know had I had I done my plan originally without knowing they were there. I probably would have cut them down. Because they just look like trees that weren't doing very well. And also I found two plums up close to the mailbox. That really looked like they were dead until that first spring. When they come to life. And I was like oh that's something growing on there. And as time went on I realized it was a plum. A natural wild plum tree. An American plum. So anyways. That's what I did. I took one year. And I didn't do anything. I just observed. Observed the property. I would take walks. At least once a week. Sometimes almost every day. I would just take a walk. And I would take a piece of paper. And I kind of like sketched out the property. And when I find places. I would mark it on my paper. And literally it got to be so much. That I started taking a GPS. And dropping waypoints. Just so that I could find. Hey there were nuts on the ground here. Where's the nut tree at? You know. Go back and look. Go back and find the nut tree. And you know. That kind of helped a lot. And I'm glad I did that. Because it totally changed. My original layout of the property. And it allowed me to plan. Where to put the rabbit hutch. Without destroying any natural food. Or where to put the chicken coop. Or where to put the goats. Or you know. Where to put the garden. Where to put the orchard. All that stuff. Once I knew what was here naturally. That was edible. Then I could plan around that. Without destroying it. Alright. So. That's the first tip. Live on your land for a year. And observe it. Through all the seasons. That's the first tip. The second tip I want to talk about. Is have a game plan. And basically what I did. Was I kind of knew what I wanted. And. I'm just like everybody else. I'm kind of impatient at times. And I want everything yesterday. But. Homesteading is expensive. So. You need to have a plan. And a budget. For homesteading. I'll get it. You know. We're obviously going to talk about that. But there's going to be more things too. So. I started with a spreadsheet. And I started with simple stuff. Like where am I going to put the garden. I thought the garden was pretty important. Right off the bat. That was one of the first things I did. And then right after that was chickens. And. Really knowing what I know now. I probably would have went with rabbits. Next. Instead of the chickens. But. It don't matter. To kind of touch on why that happened though. Is pound for pound. When you look at the cost to raise rabbits. And the food they eat. Before they're ready to harvest. Is. Much less. So. Than what it is for a chicken. So. Chickens. You got to have like. Six months before they even start laying eggs. Where rabbits. You know. You can harvest them after. A few weeks after they're born. They don't really eat a lot. As much. Or you know. Not as much as chickens. They're easier to maintain. And pound for pound. The rabbits beat chickens. Every time. And I'm still a firm believer in that. Five or six years now. On the homestead. I'm a firm believer that I probably. You know. Doing it over again. I would have got rabbits. Before I got chickens. Alright. So. I'm having a plan. What I did was. I created a spreadsheet. And I put down goals for each year. And then I estimated. What each. One of those goals. Would cost me to do. And I'm going to tell you right now. Homesteading is not cheap. Like. Unless you bought. An existing homestead. If you're starting from. Like I did. You're homesteading from scratch. Which means. There wasn't. A chicken coop on the property. There wasn't. Goat barns. There wasn't rabbit hutches. None of that stuff. So you're starting from scratch. Let me give you some figures. And these aren't exact. You know. If you want the exact figures. I'll tell you. But these are just estimates. What I know to be true. It cost me about. $2,400. For me. To build my chicken coop. And run. By myself. That's what it cost me. And materials. And you know. Time was. You know. Quite a bit of time. It was. It was actually spread out. Over a month. Because. It rained. Almost every day. That month. So I would get an hour. Or two. You know. More work done. Every day. Over a month. But you know. If. If I was going to build it. And have a really good. Solid weather week. It probably would have taken me. Four or five. Maybe six days to build it. The rabbit hutch. Cost me about $300 to build. So. Another reason why. I would have started with rabbits. Way cheaper to get started. Rabbit hutch. Is way cheaper to build. Than a chicken coop is. And. And. And. And. They produce more. Faster. So. That's another reason why. I would have started with rabbits. The goats. The goat. Is surprising. How much it's cost. I've got. Two. Of the three. Sections. Of the goat barn. Done. And. The goat. The fencing. The goat barn. That I've got done already. The fencing. And the goats. Have cost me. Almost. Eight. Thousand dollars. Now. Eight. Thousand dollars. Five goats. Um. You know. So. All of that's expensive. I think the rabbits. So. The rabbit. Hutch. You know. Three hundred dollars. And then the rabbits. I paid about a hundred dollars. For three rabbits. Give or take. I don't remember the exact. So. I had four hundred dollars. In the rabbits. And the. The first chickens. That I got. The chicken coop. And run. Cost me. Twenty. Four hundred. Dollars. I didn't pay anything. For the chickens. So you're looking at. Four hundred dollars. Versus. Twenty. Four hundred dollars. Plus. I had to feed them chickens. For six months. Before I ever got the. First egg. Where the rabbits. Only had to feed. For two months. And I already had. Nine rabbits. Ready to go. In the freezer. So. That's kind of. How that worked. Um. The garden. Um. I. I've probably got. Four or five thousand dollars. In my raised bed garden. And you know. Materials cost money. Soil. Amendments cost money. The fence cost money. To keep out the deer. All that stuff. Cost money. So. What I did though. Was. Instead of doing it all at once. I broke it down into. Every year. I created a budget. You know. What I had. Income wise. What my bills cost. What was left over. How much of that. That I was going to put. Into. The homestead. Part. And then. Another section of that. I put into. Paying off. Excess debt. Because. I was working on multiple goals. I wanted to homestead. That was one goal. I also wanted to be. Debt free. Within a certain amount of time. That was a second goal. And then I had all these projects to do. Around the homestead. To get. You know. All this stuff done. Without getting deeper in debt. So that's the other thing you got to do. You got to not get deeper in debt. Do this. With cash money. So. You know. These people that I see. That are posting all the time. Like. How much money can we make off our homestead. This is our first year. Should not even be your first worry. Because. You. Should keep your job. As a way to finance your homestead. Until you get an income coming in. So. That's going to be the third tip. Is. You need a source of income. While you're homesteading. Whether. You know. If you're married. And you're a couple. At least one of you should work. Maybe both of you should. Because that first year. You're not going to be doing anything. You're just going to be observing. Right. Because we are following step one. You're just going to observe. What's on your property. So that you don't go and mess something up. Another thing was. On the homestead. I had a bunch of. Dandelions. That only grow. In one spot. Of my yard. And that's where I had. Originally planned. To put the garden. Had I put the garden there. There would not have been dandelions. For me to make dandelion jelly with. Kind of the same way with red buds. Now there's a lot of red bud trees. On my property. But a lot of those trees. Would have got cut down. Because I had originally planned. To put the orchard. Somewhere entirely different. Than where it was. And my original goal. Was to go in. And cut down all the trees. That was currently there. And then build a new orchard. In its place. And if I would have done that. I would have cut down. Several nut trees. Several red buds. You know. There was just other. Other reasons why. So. That first step. Is the most important. The second step. Is figuring out a way. To finance your goals. Without going. Into more debt. Keeping a job. You got to keep a job. The way that I bought. This property. And have done everything. That I've done. So I come here. I did the gardens. I did the rabbits. I did the chickens. I've done the bees. I've done the bee expansion. I've done over 70 fruit trees. I've done hundreds of berries. So many berries. I've lost track. I don't even try to count them no more. The fruit trees are simple. I can just go. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. You know. On down the line. Until they're all counted. Berries. I've got them everywhere. I've planted berries. I've even forgot about berries. Um. But. All that stuff takes time. And. You might say. You know. It's probably going to take me about. Two days to build the chicken coop. And it. You can have bad weather. And it'll take you a month. And if you. Are really tight on your schedule. Then. You're not going to stay within your schedule. And you're going to get aggravated. Because things are over budget. And you didn't get everything you done. You wanted to do. So. Make sure you include. Some down time. Over a lot. On the amount of time. That you think it's going to take. I've. I've seriously gotten any more. Where if I think something's going to take. Eight hours. I just multiply it by ten. And that. You'd be surprised. How often that actually works out. So. You know. I thought it was going to take. Eight hours. But it ended up taking. Eighty. And that's. Pretty realistic. And that's not a lack of experience. That's just dealing with things. Like weather. And just. Stuff that can go wrong. On. You know. On the homestead. An animal gets sick. I've. I've had that happen numerous times. They just. Totally. Mess up. My plans. For. That day. Or the next couple of days. So. That's another tip. What else can we talk about? Getting out of debt. I. I did something. So. When I started to do this. A lot of people started to tell me about. Dave. Ramsey. And I never followed his. I never followed his. Like the way he does it. But what I found out was the way that I did it was. Pretty close. Instead of doing snowball. I did avalanche. And. I kind of did it on my own. And I created a spreadsheet. To help me track my expenses. And budget. And what I'm spending out. And my goals. And all that stuff. So. I got some spreadsheets. I'll link to. In the description. If I don't forget. If you hear it in the video. And it's not there. Remind me. I've actually got blank ones ready to go. Can you guys hear the goats? They're like going crazy. Because they hear me talking. They're just going to have to wait. So. That's kind of like. What I wanted to discuss. This is going to be a multi-part series. Because I can already tell. I'm at 16 minutes now. And I try to keep my videos. You know. Relatively low. So through editing. But. There's going to be a second part to this video. This is only the first part. I have several series planned. And. I basically just touched on. The three things. That I felt. Is super important. For you to do. If you want to get into. Homesteading. And self-sufficiency. And do it without failing. Because. I'm going to be honest with you. I am now. On my sixth year. And if all goes well. I will be 100% debt free. In about. Between 12 and 17 months. Kind of hard to tell. With this coronavirus. The only thing I owe on. Is my house. Everything else. I pay cash for. Or I charge it to a card. And I pay the card off that month. So you can do it. You just have to stay focused. And you have to have a plan. And. You have to know what you want to do. That's what I really wanted to say. Was you have to. You have to know what you want to do. You have to have a plan. And you have to have some money to back it with. And as long as you have those three things. Homesteading. And self-sufficiency. Lifestyle. Is pretty easy to do. So stick around.
