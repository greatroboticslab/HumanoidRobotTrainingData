 The Pinnbar Do we need to worry about insects at this early stage? Do we need to spray? No. Why not? At this stage the insect damage can be completely compensated for by the plant. So normally the things you get at the early stage are things like leaf folder, little bit of leaf folder and whirled maggot. Whirled maggot actually is the biggest problem this time of year. But as the plant grows it just disappears because the leaves get thicker the maggots can't actually eat the leaf. But you know I keep worrying about these things on the leaves like this here and something is chewed on it. This is a whirled maggot? That's a whirled maggot, yes. So nothing to worry about? No problem. No problem. In fact this is even light. It's not even a normal infestation of whirled maggot. What is this here? There's some egg mass on it here? Yeah these are probably some sort of parasitoid that has, so it's a wasp cocoon. And these are beneficial again. So it's good news. These will fly off, there's about 40 of them there. So they'll fly off then and parasitise things like leaf folder, larvae or other caterpillars. So they're again a beneficial insect. Finbar, I saw, already saw a few lady beetles, is what I would call them. Yeah. Are they playing much of a role at this early stage? They're also very important. They're also feeding on the natural, the herbivore insects. So they eat eggs mainly. Also good predators of aphids. And also the dragonfly, there's a lot of dragonfly flying around. One of the things when you think about insects and rice, you have to remember that in the water, another problem generated by rice is mosquitoes. And the dragonfly larvae live in the water. They have a very big, strong jaws and they prey on the mosquito larvae. So they're keeping your mosquitoes down. So really there's a whole ecosystem here functioning to keep everything in order. I mean, one really has to look hard to see all these things. I see a little spider web here and some little insects are caught in there. What are those? These are those midges that are flying around. These are the decomposer midges. So they're again beneficial. And spiders are very important predators of things like plant hoppers, mainly plant hoppers. But you know, when I look around, I see lots of critters here. Insects of all kinds, little things flying and crawling. So is that one of the reasons that some farmers think they have to spray because they see all these insects? Well, a lot of people don't understand what these insects are doing. So a lot of people, when they see these swarms of midges, for example, that are decomposing the material, they think it's a pest and they'll spray. The same with the world maggot. One of the biggest problems with the world maggot is that it induces farmers to spray. But we never see any yield reduction. The same with leaf folder. Looking quite good. Lee, do you have any worries about insects? When do we need to start worrying about them again? A little bit in Finbar's hands. My knowledge of insects is not particularly profuse. I'm probably more worried about the rats. I think the rats have just given us an early warning over there. Yeah, look at this. It's all chopped off seedlings here. Her was chopped out, which probably looks like rat damage. So some mean rat went through here and basically created a total empty patch here. Just chopped off right on the surface here. Gee, horrible. Not much we can do about that one. From Hold On Xi. You better sleep on I'm sure it's not open by jumps. Cheers for having us come on. How was it? I got seven years old. other ones coming out and going back? It must have been a fracturing to theize but you can help us. People in testing and getting a fat and E Vive. At first we wanted to go stay away from thezentmiakon. Upgrade picturing those teeth. Come on. subconsciously general phone at the time. That's quite memorable and very small. Hello bear in front. So we have to go rest on and identify with it. That's not easy. This is all right. I think we are doing great for you night in the direction. We let us see a short whatsoever. And get you as easy as fast as beautiful people indicate.
