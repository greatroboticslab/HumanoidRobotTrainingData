 This was the first pasture that dad and I introduced rotating. To introduce that into our operations that was kind of an eye-opener for my father because he was one of them old school you just turn them out they'll do their thing. It took him a few years because I'd turn out the same time and my calves would always come home bigger because the weaning weight as far as rotational grazing is just phenomenal. That's been a significant boost to our operation.
