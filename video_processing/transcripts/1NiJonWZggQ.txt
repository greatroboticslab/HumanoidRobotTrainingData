Science & Technology
 Different sets of skills are very important. Skills in livestock production or animal husbandry is very important. And facilitation skill is important. Knowledge management is important. And teamwork or team building skill is very important. And planning is also very important. And documenting lessons is also very important. So somebody who wants to work in this innovation system perspective needs to have both technical skills in his field of specialization. And horizontally he has to have some additional skills, social skills. And you learn those from Ilry or do you have them before you come to Ilry? Definitely I learned from engaging myself in this kind of project. Otherwise, previously I was in the university, I was a lecturer. And all I bothered about was just to have better knowledge and technical know-how in my field of specialization as agricultural economist. Now I have to deal with a number of issues which were not formally given in schools or in any university.
