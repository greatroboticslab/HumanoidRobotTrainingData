 Water is an important resource for everyone and every living thing. Access to clean water for domestic and agricultural needs can be difficult for many of us, especially if electricity is not available. The intent of this video is to demonstrate one way to access clean water using local materials, tools, and skills. This is a rope pump. It has been around for centuries, but with modern, readily available, low-cost materials like PVC pipe and poly rope, its use is making a difference in communities around the world. With this pump, water is pulled up from a 20-foot deep hand-dug well at about 8 to 10 gallons per minute by circulating a rope with tire pistons down the well and back up through the PVC pipe. This low-cost rope pump has been designed to be constructed, operated, and maintained by the local user community with no outside funding. For domestic use, daily water needs are met in just a few minutes through a protected well casing to keep the water source clean. The pump can be driven by your arms or legs with one or two people. For expanded agricultural needs, the pump and distribution system can be easily relocated between several wells to maximize productivity. For agricultural uses, the leg drive is the preferred method. This pump is hooked up to a three-row water distribution system made from wood and painted fabric. It is also hooked up to a locally produced, sewn Visqueen drip irrigation system that dramatically reduces the water needs. Here are some detailed views of the construction and components needed. The tools needed are hand saw, hand drill and bits, knife, and wrenches. Power tools can be used if available. The hole saw can be locally made from any steel pipe. This one is made from a bicycle frame. The wood bearings are waxed for smooth, maintenance-free operation in this wet environment. Glass bottles are used to reduce friction on the rope at the top and bottom of the pump. The pistons are made from the used tire sidewall. The double piston arrangement is used to increase efficiency and extend rope life. The locally available materials you will need are wood, one used car tire, rope, PVC pipe, two glass bottles, wire, wax, nails, and bolts. The 20-foot well was hand dug and cased with the wood used for shoring. With a pump and water distribution system like this, you can access clean water for both domestic and agricultural needs with the pride and security that comes with building it yourself. One side benefit is exercise. Thanks to all who collaborated to make this happen. For more information on this and other free assistive technology designs, go to rgat.net.
