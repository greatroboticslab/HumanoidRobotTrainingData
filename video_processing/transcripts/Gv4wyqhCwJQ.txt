 Health in a lot of ways is about complexity. You need a complex gut biome, you need a complex set of lots of different types of micronutrients. That's true for people. That's also true for plants, right? So plants are sending their roots out into the soil and they're asking for a complex bed of micronutrients. They need like organic, healthy living soil. Most of the time what they get in conventional farming operations, unfortunately, is effectively industrial imitation soil. It's just pumped full of a handful of nutrients and without that fertilizer is completely incapable of supporting life. That's not soil. That's imitation soil. And when you grow plants in that kind of soil, you get imitation plants and then you get imitation food and then you get lots of a host of problems associated with that.
