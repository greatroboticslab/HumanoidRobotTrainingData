I run the family business here, the Sintzterhof, which is located in the Rheinland in Germany. More precisely in Rommerskirchen. It's located between Aachen and Cologne. We run an arable farm here with a focus on industrial potato cultivation for the production of french fries and chips. We also cultivate cereals, winter wheat, sugar beet, winter rape and carrots. Zavio helps me to carry out plant protection and fertilization tasks in a targeted and precise manner for my children. When I open up the program, Zavio gives me a plant protection recommendation. For example, in winter wheat I select products in the program and I can create plant protection tasks or application maps. I select a plant protection product, for example the honorary treatment, specify a water application rate, specify an application rate of the product, a maximum application rate. And the program helps me to supply the zones in the area that have a high crop density with more plant protection product and to supply zones with a lower crop density with less plant protection product. Application maps are created via satellite images which are available for me. I select them and I can change them if the proposed values do not suit for me. These maps are saved in Zavio and then I can send these maps to the Agrarouter. The employee can use the MyAmaRouter app to receive the data from the Agrarouter and transfer it via wireless LAN to the Amatron 4 terminal. The application map is now on the Amatron 4 and the driver can take a look at the map and use it in the field immediately. The application map is now on the field and the driver can take a look at the map and use it in the field. When the tasks are finished on the field, the driver can send the as applied map back to the Agrarouter. This as applied map can be picked up by me from the Agrarouter in the office and I can use it in my farm management software. by depending on the facility means the
