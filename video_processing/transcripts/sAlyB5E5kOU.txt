 Welcome to this series on mastitis in dairy cows brought to you by the University of Edinburgh. This video is the hygiene in the shed. Let the cows tell you a scoring system. Mastitis is the infection of the milk producing gland, the udder. Bacteria invade the teat end via the teat canal and cause an infection. Mastitis is a fight between bacteria invading their udder and the cow fighting their infection. Hygiene in the shed. Let the cows tell you. There are many different housing systems depending on the number of cows and the space that they have. Clean cows mean the system is working. Dirty cows means it needs attention. Clean cows will have less mastitis. Hygiene scoring. This lets the cows tell you if you have a problem. Each cow is scored in three areas on a scale of 0 to 2. The areas are the flank including the tail, the lower hind leg and the udder. Cows are scored in these areas as follows. Clean cows with only splashes of manure score a 0. If there is more than a palm sized amount of dirtiness score a 1. If there is more than a forearm length of dirtiness score a 2. Any score of 2 suggests there is a problem of shed hygiene. If only the lower hind legs are dirty then the problem is likely to be cleaning of passageways or drainage where the cows are walking. If the udder and the lower part of the cows are dirty then it is a problem with where the cows are lying. If it is around the tail and the flank where the tail swishes is it a problem with diarrhea? Is there a problem with the diet? If the dirtiness is all over is there perhaps a problem with overcrowding or manure removal? There would be another 2. If there is a different one that are circulating needs. From the throesernÄ… a 20 on a 20 on an magro which has aortic
