 Hey good morning. You guys ever wake up in the middle of the country and the guy you're staying with is like, hey can you go out there and try to shoot some of those coyotes? My wife's killed about seven of them off the back porch lately and we're having a bad problem with them taking our cattle out this year. You can do me a favor and just lock and load and send some lead down range if you see a furry critter out there. That's kind of what I woke up to this morning. Me and Flair are out here at Favorite Ranch. We're doing a little rod design this week and just kind of hanging out in the country. So anyway, this is what you do. You just grab me a cup of coffee and you look for goatees. I believe that's a white van coming in right now. Well, I think Winston's working on something out here at the crib. Meanwhile, I'm loading a high powered rifle as they're coming in to check things out. It makes me feel really uncomfortable. Flair doing some glassing right now. This is high stakes hunting right here next to the septic tank and we got guys working on the pool over here waiting on something to come out. There's actually a real beautiful field out here. I don't really know what we're doing. I guess we're just kind of waiting on breakfast. This is kind of what you do out here. You just wait for varmints to come out. You shoot one if one comes out and then you go grab you some eggs and some coffee and start your day. That's Flair improvising in a pinch. Brilliant. You can almost hear it over the semis down the highway. Hey Poochie. You look like you have problems. Oh. Aww. What a cutie. I don't think the coyote hunting is really going to happen. But I did manage to scrounge myself up a stout cup of coffee. Free range, I might add. A lot of stuff happening right here. There's a lot of big equipment. Besides the pool building, this is going to be like a favorite fishing hangout area and just also for just general pool use at the favorite ranch. All this back here is going to be a massive, I think it's going to be a 38 acre lake with 60 foot deep a dam crappie. It's going to have bass. It's going to have big bluegill all laid out very nicely. And I think Jimmy Houston is actually going to help with the design of this. Maybe a few other anglers. I don't know if you guys know about Jimmy Houston but he's got some phenomenal ponds. I've actually been there and I've seen them. I've fished them. They're incredible. He has an incredible place. Knows a thing or two about building ponds. This all back here where we were looking for coyotes this morning. This is going to be a giant lake. So it'll be something really neat where we can just come up, take boats out, test lures, test rods, test all kinds of stuff, go hang out at the pool. It'll be a phenomenal place to be in the outdoors. So looking forward to that. Pretty excited. You know what? I see some rods over here right now. I see Flair and see Winston with some rods. So I think it's time to go do some fish. Poots, you going with us today for the coyote time? Is it hooch or pooch? This is Poots. Poots. Formerly known as Daisy. Okay. She likes to talk, don't you? Daisy. Poots. Daisy Poots. Well, I guess that's the only coyote we're going to see today, huh? I thought you had one. Oh, I got it. I got a gun. Don't worry. It's that Tucker life right here. Grab you a cup of coffee, hop in the mule, grab your dog. Daisy Poots. Poots. Poots with a T. Poots with a T. Now you just kind of cruise the farm. Maybe look for some sticks. Check on the cows. Make sure things are checked. Don't let anything fall apart out here. If you're lucky, you get to cast a line. We need to move these cows. We need to do. That's next year's Angus hamburger steaks ready for the freezer right there. Hey, what's happening here? What's happening here? Oh, that cow's upset with them. The cow's chasing the sheep. The cow's vicious, you know, Matt, cows have been known to be carnivorous. I think we need to turn Matt Liss on one and see if he can sort these cows. I think so too. Can we please do that for video? I'm not getting out of the vehicle. Are you scared of cows? It's a Jurassic Park. Oh, they're coming right to the pond too where we're supposed to fish. Oh, Jimmy, is that a llama? Of course. We gotta have a llama. There's a herd of cows and then there's just a llama randomly out in the middle. Is that what they do? The llamas protect the cows? They're supposed to. This one doesn't do much. There it is. Just right out in the middle like a giraffe just trotting around. It looks so funny, man. It's hilarious. You gotta open the old cattle gate here. I know, I know. Eat more chicken and all that good stuff. Definitely wanna lock that back up. I don't have anything today. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I eat Chick-fil-A all the time. Don't worry. These things get angry. Get on. Oh, my gosh. We're in the belly of the beast out here in the... We're going to the valley beyond. Watch out now, girl. Let me teach you how to call them that. You know how to call them that? No. It's called... You gotta go woo-sook. Let's go. Woo-sook! Come on! Woo-sook! Come on! Woo-sook! Come on, now! Woo! How do you call this llama now? That's... Look at that thing. It's cocked its head sideways. He don't like me. He's named Paul. Hey, Paul. Paul, look at him jabber-jawing over there. God dang. Paul hates men. Look at Paul. That is the funniest dang creature I've ever seen in my life. His ears back and they spit on you. Hey, Paul. Paul. Woo-so! Come on, now! Get it in gear, baby! Yeah! You know, that does work, Winston. That does. Look, this one's frothing at the mouth. Arrrr! This one's... Look at this. Thanks, good. You got it. You got it. This vehicle, you're done. Woo! Dun-dun-dun-dun! Dun-dun-dun! Woo! Dun-dun-dun-dun! Woo! Cut me off! Hey, look out, now. Look out, now. Look at those ears pinned back. You don't want to mess with them, man. Really? Oh, yeah. When they pin their ears back, you better watch out. Oh, ****! You see that? Woo-so! Yeah, baby! You can't do that in the city. No, you cannot. Here, boys. Woo! Woo! It smells like something fresh over here, boys. Just wait. Please, come on. Oh, that's big in there. That is old Big Mama. That is Big Mama. That is Big Mama. It jumps out on that. That's old Willis. Woo! Willis? That's his name? That's Wilbur. Oh, I was about to say. Old Wilbur. He's pretty dang-gum big. Look at that pear on him, dick! Just got to get a couple more mamas to go through, and then all these little ones are going to follow suit. Get in there. All right, we got a pond. We've got flare. Therefore, I mean, there's probably going to be fish caught. It's a fire pond, you know? You know? This is where flare caught the six? Six? I caught a good fish, Aaron. Six or seven pounds? Yeah. It was that big. It was like five. It was your PB at the time, wasn't it? No. No. Oh, let's see. Well, you already got a topwater tide on. There's a couple of rods with nothing that are ready for something. Remember that on the end cap at Bassboro. The walking worm features a lifelike tail action. Goes straight up in the air to mimic leeches. Walleye's absolutely slurp and gurp them. Sounds pretty spotty. Did you make that video? God dang. You guys are pretty nice. Little Peppa Poop. Look at that tackle box. It's frog season. I mean, frog or chatterbait. Solly, throw it. A Senko. A Senko. Other than that, that's about all I got. Does this break a lot of rules? You need a barrel swivel clip on a frog? I did that until I was 18 years old. Really? So it's all good, right? I snapped it on. If I saw someone do this, I would cringe. So I would look at the guy and be like, you have absolutely no idea what you're doing. That was true. That's what I'm doing right now. That's true. Put it on a Senko. It's extra dive action. My dad had a box of these randomly. These little tiny ones. I'm going to take them up to Canada. Because you know the mayflies? Oh yeah. They'll probably slurp that thing like a little candy corn. Hula Popper. I just like being around fishing. Kind of makes me happy. Yep. Dodge a cow pad here too. Give the old popper a toss. Now when you're pond fishing, you've got to stay back, Matt. I got you. They can see you already. I promise y'all I didn't just snag that fish. He came up and tried to tag that topwater by the bank. These fish are just now starting to spawn. It's crazy. Oh, he came off. Well, I think we had three bites. He's captured one. Lost a frog. Poots. Poots. She hid mud on Rackler's white britches. Poots. Got a second little fishing hole over here. And the goats need to be fed. Tucker's going to get in here and feed them a goat. Got to give them some roughage to keep their rooters going, I think is what he said. By the way, most tick infested region at all time. Okay, you got to call them in with the bush. Here they are. They come right on in. You got to have a little persimmon leaf in the morning. Wait, did you cut that thing there? So they just cut... You just bend that tree over and they just come right on in. Bend it over. You look at them going to town. So... They have to have that to keep their rooming going. Oh, I got you. So they just go crazy when you give them a nice fresh tree. They got to have a little persimmon in the mornings. Oh, that's a persimmon tree. Yeah. Those are those fruits that aren't very good, right? They're amazing good. They're amazing good? Yeah. You don't eat them when they're green because they're... Okay, that's what I did when I was a kid. Somebody dared me to. Those leaves are almost gone now. That whole branch. That's gone. They're gone. So these goats are now going to have a nice rheumatory system. Flush their units out. I probably need to give the old topwater a send. Oh, hey there. Hey. Easy. You're trying to get... Oh, yeah. Get up in there. Reach them. Wow. That sucker's seven feet tall when he wants to be. Okay. Let me get this pop-ar out of the way before we hook a goat. So when you get home from all these business trips, you just come out here and you bend the tree over and herd the cows. Yeah. Okay. Okay. These goats have kind of exhausted the area. They need some help. Meanwhile, he's over there fighting Billy. Look, they're just going to ravage this tree. I kind of like this farm life. So Winston was saying that they lost 30 goats this year to coyotes. Y'all can believe that. So they got just these wild dogs running. And they lost about 100 chickens to raccoons and coyotes. So they got a big problem. We need to come up here and do some coyote maintenance, I think. Nope. Don't eat the popper. Organic berries. What kind of berries? Blackberries. Mmm. They're young. They'll turn red and they'll turn black. About three weeks we'll be eating blackberry ice cream. Homemade ice cream at the old pool. Mmm. I cut that tree down. Look at that. That might be a five-pounder laydown one of these days. Look at that stump. Winston was saying all this is going to be underwater. He's leaving it for building the big lake or the pond. You can see the field down here. Oh, yeah. So this little bank will be, that'll be the water edge right there. We'll drive around. And I'll show you where the dam will be at the top. But it'll be 1,250 foot long. It'll be 54 deep at the dam. And it'll be about 280 feet wide at the dam. I mean, and then you can just sit up there and wait for the deer to come. Not a bad little dealio. Well, then there's another, there's a spring right there, huh? How many springs did you say there's? According to the government, there's 11 springs. 11 springs feeding it. That's awesome. We're going to drill them out and put a big piece of steel in, perforate the holes. That way we have to shoot right up. That's a shoot right up. That's a shoot right up. This is a little lily pad spring pond. It looks like this year round. It'll, we'll cut this bank. This will be part of it. Bass love that stuff. There's been those pads that have been here for about 20 years. There's some juicy frogs in there that are going to escape. Get munched by Mondos. So right here will be the top of the dam. Right here. All this brush. We'll drive around where it's clear and you can see. But this, this will be where the dam starts and it'll go straight 1,250 feet. It's going to be ultimate. It's ultimate Mondoville. Giant horse fly right there. That was a big son of a dick. Oh, you got it. You got it. Moxon's up here for real. Oh, yeah. Well, that's great. So we're going to come down here and get a bunch of these little flat river rocks before we flood it for the, you can see up through here. Yeah, so you can get some cool stuff for the pool or something. Yeah, I'm going to lay them around that little ditch around the pool. This is going to be where the crappies and the Mondo bass. We're probably catching about halfway up that tree maybe. Yeah, we'll be in about, well, the waterline. So that corner will be the dam. But I got, I bought this, the neighbor's property. We're going to doze all that out. 54 foot there, so we should be about 30, 35 feet right here. That's insane. So I think this is going to be the LFG Mondo tree right here. And then we got Flair's crappie kingdom over there. That's right. Something like that. Winston was just talking about making little landmarks all over the lake. Kind of, since we're going to, you know, do videos on the build and help out with some stuff. I think that would be pretty sweet. Tadpoles and frogs and crawdads are already, already got them in here. Natives. I mean, it's made, this was supposed to be a lake. It's whole life. It's just been waiting to be a lake. I love that. Look at that frog jumping in there. Comes out right under this tree. And there's another one. Oh, I see. I see what you're saying. So it probably runs, it's connected to that little spring pond up there. This whole, like we call this. Runs underground. It's not a hay holler, but it's, it's actually a swamp. Like there's probably 10 or 15 artisans. It's everywhere. I feel like if we walked across it right now, we'd sink up this deep. And we could just take a sip. Take a sip. Mm. So that's where that natural water is going to come out and feed this glorious, nutritious filled lake. Poison army is pretty strong down here. Well, there's some. And there's some, I've seen some seed on that root. Leaves of three. Mm. Stay away. How old is that tree stand right there? It's gotta be 55 years old. It was built in the early 50s. Solid quality back then. So we're going to try to leave that so we can scuba dive down here if the water gets us clear because there's some other big spring right up here. So we're hoping it'll be clear enough. We can sit in that tree stand and shoot a catfish. This will all be gone. We're looking at the dam. I'll show you when we get back. The dam will be up there. There. There's another little wet spot. Yeah. Little springs. Chubby little groundhog. Munching on clover. And that tree's going to be left in here? Yep. Wow. That'll be right on the bank. He's already marked it on his graph. Yeah. God, can you imagine getting a fish out of the base of that thing? No, that quail's just chilling. Try to get him to whistle. Oh, he's getting ready to duck out. Yeah. He sees Ruger. There it goes. Bob White Point. There it is. Just named it. Well, after a long morning of hanging out on the farm, we're actually here at the favorite headquarters. We're going to be going aside, doing a little designing, just talking about some stuff for next year. But, just after seeing that whole entire layout of what that lake is going to be like, I cannot wait to get up here. It's going to be the perfect place to come up here, test out new rods, go fishing, film videos, and just hang out and just have a good time out in the country. Definitely going to bring Stephanie up here. Winston's family is pretty awesome, too. Winston's wife, she makes her own jam. She pickles her own stuff. You know, it's like dream stuff for Stephanie. So, I've got to bring her up here sometime. She'd love it. Hi. Hi, I'm Justin. Hi, nice to meet you. Okay. You guys want to see the holding room? Oh, God bless you. This is the room. This is where it all goes down. I don't know if I can actually show everything in here. But, this is the full-blown selection. Mexico memorabilia right here. This is that tournament that me and Winston fished in right here. There it is. LFG right there. Team USA representing. We actually won that tournament. And, we got some Major League Baseball action happening right here. For all you Rangers fans, we got Rangers rods. The Mondo warehouse. This is a new memorabilia wall. This? Oh, yeah. Remember this? Heck, yeah. How long ago was that? Two years? Yeah, that was a while, man. Flare bear. All that right there, ladies and gentlemen. Favorite fishing rods heading out the door. Maybe it's going to your house. There's so much fishing stuff in here. It'll blow your mind. I don't know why I have something like this. My head kind of hurts, to be honest with you. Kind of got one of them headaches right now. Everywhere you look, there's something. You never know when you need rope. I mean, that's what I'm saying. I'll take some rope, but... Oh, hey, guys. You need some flashlights in your life? Maybe some calls. How about a little call action? What in the world? That is the most calls I've ever seen in one time. Let's load up on some stuff here. I literally had a fox in my backyard two days ago. I want to try to get some of this stuff on camera, see what's roaming around back there. It's a new morning. I just woke up. I wanted to come out here and just kind of soak in the sunrise. It's incredible. I don't know if y'all can see the deer that are on past the tractor down there by the creek. They're actually sitting in where the deepest part of the lake is going to be, besides the dam, like down in the creek area. So that's just going to be phenomenal, y'all. I can't wait. The date on that? Around September when we get this thing up and rolling. There's a lot of things involved in building a lake of this size because it's going to be the biggest 30 or 40 mile radius. This is going to be the biggest lake around here. So it's not just a little pond in the backyard. It's an actual lake that will sustain wildlife in this county and probably a lot of other counties surrounding here. So I just can't wait to see this project get started. And we're going to be coming up here and doing videos on it. Guys, I love it up here. I love it up here. I really want to take Stephanie up here, show her the farm. This is exactly why I told you guys in the beginning I wanted to work with Favorite. It's because it's more than just fishing and a corporation. It's a family. They're my friends. So I'm going to sign you off on that good note. It is time to go back and get with Ocean Spoon Girl. I have heard she has made my favorite cookies. They're done. They're available. So I got to get back there and get me some of that. But I'm wishing you guys the best wherever you are. I hope you're catching Mondo's. I hope you're having a blessed, blessed day. And I wish you the best. And if you want to subscribe right here to the channel, you guys know what to do. Hit that subscription button. Hit the ding-dongs for all the notifications. Especially if you want to follow along with the pond stuff this summer leading into fall. It's going to be a huge project. It's going to be a lot of fun. But I wish you guys the best. And I'll see you on the next one. Later. later. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
