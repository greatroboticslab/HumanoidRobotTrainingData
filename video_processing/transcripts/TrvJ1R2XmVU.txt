 Hello my name is Ashley today I'm going to show you how to make homemade natural pesticides. So what for the trees that when you have bugs and things like that emphasis how to get rid of it without putting chemicals. So what it is is in a cup you put some water and you have any kind of jalapeno pepper that's really hot. You take the stems out you just drop it in as many as you want four or five because the cup is you know not too big so you put about six seven five whatever two or three doesn't matter just close the if you have any kind of blender it doesn't matter this kind of blender doesn't matter any blender it will work you just close it make sure I was going to say that put the gloves in your hands still it's not hot yet but after you do the work you make sure for me I'm gonna make a noise for a second I'm gonna blend it you take it out and see if there is any big pieces which is all you see it it's crumble you do a few more minutes it takes about two to three minutes a second that's all you need now I have to wear my gloves even from the beginning you can wear it it's almost always it's safer and sometimes when you do this the fume it can burn your nose like the so what you do is you can put sometimes your mask on so what you do is you take a cheese cloth or any kind of material that little bags which I use this a lot for a lot of things to use for this shit for the kitchen you put in a strainer and under there is a plastic container tupperware doesn't matter whatever it is make it simple easy you go through to the to the cloth the cheese cloth and you let it ground down now because we have to put in a spray bottle we don't want any practical pieces because it will plug the the hose the pipe and it's good to wear a mask like I said it's kind of hot the fumes but anyway I have to show you this way and then what you do is I have a spray that I bought it here this is for my spray that I paid to spray my trees I have to open it put some water in it it's about like a gallon gallon and a half again it doesn't matter warmer hotter it is the spice spicy it is it's better in a gallon of gallon and a half water you pour it in and you close it make sure that you close it very tight because whenever you spray it now whenever you spray make sure this time really well this is the best way to do it and when you have to spray it you have to wear a mask and a goggle otherwise it will from the air from the wind it's going to blow your side and it might burn your eyes or your breathing all right thank you very much this is very simple is you be inspired and try it thank you very much for watching I'll see you next time bye bye
