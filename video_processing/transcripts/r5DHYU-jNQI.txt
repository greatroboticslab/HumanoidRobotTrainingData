 I'm Simon O'Meara farming here in Wilden, West Otago with my wife Penny and three children. We're farming a 565 hectare sheep and beef property. We're looking at a wintering block here where we're wintering Frisian bulls on fodder beet and just looking at the way we're grazing them really so that's what we're here for today. With the winter the way it is we really have to carry some feed through from the summer into the winter to be able to get through and you know fodder beet and kale and winter brassicas are a good option just to carry some quality right through and especially fodder beet with cattle we're taking some good quality feed that they can grow right through into October on so it's been a real winner. The Pomahake catchment project was started up about three years ago and it was basically a group of farmers all farmers sheep and beef dairy and forestry and everybody all got together and decided that we needed to improve the Pomahake River because it was labeled by the Otago Regional Council was the worst river in Otago so we thought well that's not really good enough so we all got together and thought well how are we gonna go about improving it so we decided the best way was to see what the problem was with a lot of water testing and yeah so the group started off testing a lot of tributaries all the tributaries the main river as well and saw where the problem was and found out that it wasn't actually just a dairy problem and it was pretty much catchment wide so and that was when we started doing some on-farm water testing and yeah me being a sheep and beef farmer I thought oh yeah it's not my problem but when we started testing on this place we found out that yeah there was water quality issues here maybe different to the dairy industry but where it was more sediment and phosphorus but so that's why we've needed to focus a wee bit more on winter crops because that seems to be our weakest link with when we've got the beer soil. What we're doing is changing the way we graze paddocks making sure we don't let anything anywhere near any waterways and we're grazing paddocks from the top down so that we can you know stop the sediment ending up in the waterways so grazing down the hill from top to bottom where what we're doing is when the stock are loosening up any soil and there's a rainfall event the sediment will come down the hill through the break where it's been eaten through the crop and then there'll be a grass buffer before the waterway or the drain or the critical source area so that all the sediment will get trapped before it gets into the waterway so that's the that's the crux of the grazing management. With the last break as you're coming into the wrapping up grazing the paddock with your mob you want to have a good buffer zone of grass on a flat area probably at least two to three meters and on a steep area maybe anything up to 20 meters and so the further back you go the better but if you're grazing that last that last break on a dry day preferably or a dry couple of days so that there's no sediment loss that's going to end up in the waterway. When we're grazing the paddocks you know top to bottom now we're seeing it when we're coming down the hill when there's a rainfall event the sediment's actually flowing through the crop that's been grazed into the leafed area that hasn't been grazed and it stops there it's not even getting into the grassed area so that's showing us that it really does work. Yes I think it's something that every farmer should adopt initially especially with cattle it's a no-brainer just to do straight away but there's you know real gains to be made with stopping that sediment there's a lot of soil that has been shown to be moving with cattle grazing on winter crops with all that bare soil we're really vulnerable in the winter so you know you've just got to get on and do it it's just stopping that sediment right where it's started rather than waiting for it to come downstream. It's been reasonably easy it's just a change of mindset really where you're grazing them and you've got something else to think about you're not just thinking about water troughs or where you put them in the easiest gate it is to get to it's a matter of you know thinking about it a year in advance and planning making sure you've got water in the right place and maybe putting up a couple of extra electric fences to make sure that you can do it properly.
