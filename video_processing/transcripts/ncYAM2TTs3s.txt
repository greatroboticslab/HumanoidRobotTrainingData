Growing hot peppers in pots

 Generically named computer assistant, what is the current temperature? Right now it's 96 degrees Fahrenheit. Hey it's Rob and I'm a sucker for punishment so I am out here in the backyard. I have received my hopefully last shipment of plants other than one which is coming as a replacement for one that died in the last shipment. I want to try and repot these and get them stuck out front. I've got seven jalapenos and then four more reapers, some Trinidad scorpions and some ghost peppers. I do have some ghost peppers already. I mean these are not exotics by any means. They are hot peppers but I want to try and put them in pots. And I got some new pots that I want to try. These are these. I think these are the two gallon? Yeah it's hard to tell. It says 105 ST. So you know it's a 105 ST. I have no idea what that means but these might just be the one gallon. I am not entirely sure. But I think they are big enough for maintaining the root system of a pretty healthily growing pepper plant. And I'm going to try. You know this is my first time really doing a large pepper grow in pots. So we'll see how it works out. This is my soil mixing system. I have a concrete mixture that I put the dirt and whatever else in. And I mix it around for a while. Make sure that it's pretty thoroughly mixed up. And then I can dump it in the wheelbarrow and put it into the pots. I know that sounds exciting doesn't it? I know that sounds like it's very interesting. I have a lot of soil that I am going to be doing. That's enough for a pretty decent start on these pots. I don't want to take all the soil out of this because I might have more than I'm going to be doing. When I'm done with it, I'll end up putting it back in here until I can get a large 5 gallon pail to be able to store it in. It's got a nice convenient lid that isn't cracked. I made that mistake. What I want to do with these is fill them up to within about 4 inches of the top, maybe a little bit deeper than that. A couple shovelfuls, give it a nice bottom. A little bit more. I'm going to pack this down just a little bit, not a lot, to give it a base for the plants to sit on. I'm going to do this with the first 8. Already some little plants growing in here. This is the easiest way I've found of doing transplants into pots. First of all, we take the plant that we are transplanting. These are, I got from Bonnie plants, which are pretty good. You want to break up the soil a little bit. Tease the roots out. Get them so that they are running around in the soil a little bit looser. Then just pile in dirt around the outside. It's so much easier than trying to dig a hole in what was, you know, in the soil that you put in a pot. I like to fill these not quite up to the top and make a sort of a moat, a little depressive moat around roots like that, keeping the stem and the edges up. It helps to, you know, sluice the water in a little bit, although it's not that important. And, of course, keep the stakes in so that I know what the peppers are. Because until they start sprouting peppers, it's really difficult to tell. Sometimes they don't want to come out very well. Oh, look at the roots on this one. That's lovely. And by doing this, you're going to do some damage to the roots, but they will grow back very well. I like to keep these pots that the plants came in because they're still in pretty good shape, and I can use these for spouting seeds for next year. I am going to need to get more soil because I still have 15 more of these to go. 16 if you include the one that's coming. All right. This is what I've got so far for plants in pots. I've got these growing in here. Now, there is one thing that I don't really like about, well, a couple things I don't particularly like. I do have some growing in these, which have had surprisingly good results over the past few years. It's kind of amazing that they don't need nearly as much soil as you think they do. Although these go down into the dirt. I mean, they grow roots down into the soil, so they get plenty. But these guys may have to weed. And that's okay. It's not a lot. You know, that's enough of a pain in the butt because I do have a lot of pots growing here. And then, of course, there is the in-ground garden. Now I'm using this house wrap as... Oh, look at the ants. I am using this house wrap as a weed block. And it's more weatherproof than the normal weed block that you see over there. But it really cuts down on the weeding. There's some stuff that will grow under their Creeping Charlie in particular. But, you know, I've got quite a few plants in here. And they are doing quite okay. Now one of the nice things is I set up this water irrigation system with the soaker hoses. And that has done remarkably well in keeping these guys watered. Right now I've got it, I think, dialed in to about 30 minutes once a day. And there are four zones. And they all run at different times. So it's not oversaturating all the soil at one time. It's kind of spreading the love. I am going to have to do some more weeding in the, you know, on the periphery and some of that. But, this is... I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this yet. Ideally, this would go into the territory of whole house air conditioner. But that's probably not going to happen anytime soon. So I might end up moving... creating a mulch pile back here. A compost pile. Because right now, these are my compost bins. It's all leaves and organic material. Teabags are all biodegradable. So they will eventually degrade down. The little metal staples in there are steel. They will degrade into iron, which is actually fairly good for plants. And it's not in huge, huge levels. So it's not going to be toxic at all. These guys... these tall boys or something else. I got these from Frostbite Peppers. And he grew them... he started them really early. I think around... Super Bowl weekend? I think is when he said he started them. So they got a pretty good head start. And they seem to be doing okay. I was a little worried that they might have some issues because they're so tall. But they seem to be standing up for themselves pretty well. Yeah, I know. There's traffic noise. There's not much I can do about it because there are cars on the road. I've got 15 more. 16, technically, to put in pots. I'm not going to do it today because I am out of soil to put in the pots. I'm going to have to go to the hardware store tomorrow. They're closed already. It's a little later in the evening. So, you know, a little cooler, which is nice. But I'm going to try and do those tomorrow, weather permitting, and see if I can get all of them planted. One of the nice things about growing in pots is that as the plants grow bigger, I can move them, and I can give them more space, and I can rotate them around in different areas so that they can get more or less sun as needed. I don't know. This is my first year doing anything quite this big. So we're going to give it a shot and see how it goes. Anyway, I'm going to do the other ones tomorrow. I'm not going to do them tonight because it's still pretty freaking hot. And I'm tired. I'll see you guys next time. Peace.
