 Music So in the spring if you're thinking about testing your soil in the garden you have a couple of options. One is to collect a soil sample and send it into the lab for analysis. And the second is to buy one of these simple kits that allows you to analyze your soil at home and get some general recommendations for either adding fertilizer or adjusting your soil pH. They are all based on adding soil and water to a tube and then adding a reagent and then matching the color in the tube to the color on a card. So they're a simple test and will give us some general information about the status of our soil. Once you've put the soil in and the reagent and the water and followed the instructions, you will match the color to one of the color cards. So for the pH test you'll match it to the pH card, phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium. It's a pretty simple kit. It's simply putting the reagents and the water and the soil into the tube and matching the color. So these kits are all available generally for under $30 at most garden stores or you can order them online. There are also other kits available. These results won't be as precise as sending them into the lab for analysis, but for most of us in the garden it will get us close enough and it will help us determine how much fertilizer we might need to add or if we need to adjust our pH.
