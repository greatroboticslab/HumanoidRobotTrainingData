Howto & Style
 Many people come in and they say, how can I start? And I've got this one acre land. And I say, well, start with fruit trees. And around each fruit tree, make a garden. So you're watering those fruit trees. And that water will also go for that garden. So around each fruit tree, you have like a two and a half meter diameter circle where you have tapioca, the maravillikelinga, kappa. You have drumstick, you have a papaya, you have a couple of bananas. And maybe you have pumpkins that go out. So instead of trying to irrigate the whole field and take care of the whole field, you've actually got, say, 20 or 30 circles that you take care of. And you could even put a drip on each circle. Because you have to be practical, you know. This is a very romantic idea that we're presenting. But it's grounded in utter pragmatism and reality.
