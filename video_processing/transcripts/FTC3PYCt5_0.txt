 What is hydroponics? Hydroponic gardening is a method of growing plants without soil. In hydroponic gardening, the water does the work. In this case, the work of delivering nutrients to the plant roots in order to grow plants. Hydroponics is the cultivation of plants using water, nutrients, and a growing medium. It's growing without using soil. There are different types of hydroponic systems. There's the wicking system. As its name states, a wick and a phenomenon called capillary action, the nutrient solution will slowly but regularly and constantly spread from where there is more to where there is less water as the plants need it. You may also see an ebb and flow or what is called flood and drain system. The basic concept of an ebb and flow hydroponic system is fairly simple. Plants are placed in a tray which is periodically filled with nutrient-rich water, pumped out of a reservoir below. The system uses gravity to return the water to the reservoir to be reused. NFT. Nutrient Film Technique. Nutrient Film Technique is a hydroponic technique where a shallow stream of water containing all the dissolved nutrients required for the plant growth is recirculated past the bare roots of the plant in a watertight gully, also known as channels. Aeroponics are specialized versions of hydroponics where the roots of the plant extend only in air and the roots are directly sprayed with the nutrient water. In a drip system of hydroponics, the water-based nutrient solution is delivered to the root system of plants using drip irrigation. Drip systems are ideal for vertical hydroponic farming since the nutrient can be placed at the top and gravity sends it down to the rest of the plants. DWC, or deep water culture, is one based on a tank called a grow tank where you have the nutrient solution and an air pump to provide air to the roots. There are a few disadvantages to hydroponic systems. The initial costs are sometimes higher, a deeper knowledge is needed, and sometimes they need a little bit more attention. Having thought about the disadvantages, I knew the proven advantages were worth an initial investment in a small hydroponic system. What are the benefits of hydroponic systems? Plants grow significantly faster. When existing soil is poor, hydroponics is the best option. Hydroponics crops yield from 20 to 25 percent greater than soil. It requires less space and uses a lot less water. than soil farming. Hydroponics also has a lot of health benefits. Eating more vegetables can improve your overall health. No pesticides are ever used in hydroponics. Growing without soil reduces and minimizes the risk of contamination from growing vegetables in dirt that uses manure. And the vegetables harvested from our hydroponic system last two to three times longer and can be harvested even after being cut two to three times. DWC or deep water culture fit our family's needs and it was a great place to start. Hydroponics is too simple and too good for me not to share it with you.
