So this guy is running course play. Just going to go in about that field. We have our John Deere 8370R with the Demco saddle tanks. Pulling our DB planter. Planting corn. We have a 9RT pulling an air seeder. Drilling in some barley. Looking pretty dirty. I'm currently working on... I finished the model and I'm working on redoing the temperatures on it. Hopefully I have a new seeder in a couple days. Then I can go ahead and finish up my DB60 24 row. Just to have to supplement this big one. Just need to finish up the row markers. Since a small plant like that doesn't have folding wings. So this thing is on a struggle bus right now. I just have the four wheel drive engaged. For the front wheel assist. Seems to do just fine. No slippage really. No need for any other gear. No need for any other gear. I'm just going to go ahead and finish up the front wheel assist. For the front wheel assist. For the front wheel assist.
