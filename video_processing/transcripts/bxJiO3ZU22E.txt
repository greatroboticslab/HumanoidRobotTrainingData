 Winter brings its challenges for horse owners from freezing temperatures to managing icy conditions. Whether you're new to horse care or looking for a refresher, I'll walk you through the best practices for keeping your horse safe, warm, and healthy this season. So let's dive in. So let's start with blanketing basics. Blanketing can feel overwhelming but it doesn't have to be. Horses naturally grow a thick winter coat that acts as an insulator by trapping air, but some horses may need extra help. So here's what you need to consider. When to blanket. If your horse is clipped, underweight, elderly, or struggles to maintain body heat, blanketing is a must. But if they're healthy, well-fed, and grow a full winter coat, they probably don't need one. Choosing the right blanket. There are three main types. Lightweight sheets for mild cold, medium weight for chilly weather, and heavyweight blankets for frigid temperatures. Proper fit. Ensure the blanket doesn't rub or restrict movement. It should sit snugly but not tight around the chest and belly. Always check straps daily to avoid dangerous snags. And the other things you need to check every day, sometimes multiple times a day. Weather, you know, temperature changes. Was it really cold in the morning? And so you had the sheet and then a heavy winter blanket on and then a turnout rug. And now your horse is outside and it's 45 degrees. Like you, you need to be able to monitor these things and make the blanket switches when need be. Because not being able to do that, not monitoring every couple of hours, you could, you know, create conditions for your horse that are not good. You know, like sores, excessive sweating, and then it gets cooler later on. Now they're sweaty and wet. And then it cools down and now they're freezing. So there's so many things you have to consider when it comes to blanketing. I'm lucky Dakota grows a polar bear coat in the wintertime. What I do for him is I curry him almost daily. I will curry him to make sure that there's no hair sticking together, that it's standing up. And so that, you know, when it's really frigid cold and windy, he just turns his butt to the, to the wind and continues to munch on his hay. Now we're going to jump into managing frozen water. Oh boy. Not fun. One of the worst parts of winter in my humble opinion. But access to fresh unfrozen water is a non-negotiable for horses. Even in the dead of winter, dehydration is a silent threat and definitely can increase the risk of colic. So here's some tips to manage water during freezing temperatures. Invest in heated water options. Heated buckets and trough de-icers are lifesavers. Make sure they're properly grounded to prevent shocks. I don't use them inside the barn. Of course, Dakota would only come into the barn if it was terribly horrible, horrible out, meaning like sleet and combined with the frigid temperatures. Um, what, or, or if you weren't feeling well, then he would come into the barn. But I would use an insulated bucket before I would use one of those heated flat sided buckets because they're dangerous and many a barn fire have occurred because of those, those buckets. So I don't use heated buckets in the barn. However, I have invested in the big, they look like muck buckets, but they're heated. Um, those work really well consistently. I've had a lot of issues with the drop in heaters not being grounded properly. And, and the problem guys is within the heater itself. You can have everything set up properly, grounding rods, outlets that are grounded, the whole nine yards, but you could have a faulty heater. My suggestion to you is to wherever it is that you're purchasing, go to a, a, you know, store like tractor supplier, whatever. I'm not promoting any one of those, but go there in person, bring a voltage meter with you and right in front of the cashier before you pay for that, check it. Many of them are being bought and they're defective and they're shocking your horses. Once you shock your horse, when they're trying to get a drink of water, then you really increase the risk of dehydration and impaction, colic, because they're going to be terrified to drink from that bucket again. Okay. So again, I have found those big, not big troughs, but they look, they're the size of a muck bucket, um, that are heated, have worked consistently the best. Haven't found any shock issues. And again, but make sure that your outlets are grounded and you got to check them. You know how you check them? Barefooted and you stick your hand in there. Yep. Rather you than a 10,000, $20,000 colic surgery, right? Okay. Here's some DIY hacks for ice-free water. If heated options are not feasible, try insulating your buckets with foam or wrapping them with a heat retaining cover. I've seen people build like a box for a stock tank and then putting a layer, a thick layer of straw under the stock tank and around it and setting the stock tank in there. That will help insulate it, get it off the ground. Oh, add a floating ball that can help delay freezing. The other thing we used to do was we had, um, big aquarium bubblers that we put in our, in our troughs and those worked really well. Kind of like pond bubblers, right? You ever see they do that for the wildlife on backyard, big ponds and they'd have this, you know, they have a fountain or they've got bubblers going. Works. You got to make frequent ice checks guys. You got to break and remove the ice multiple times a day if necessary. Just make sure you always have a rubber mallet or a crowbar to help make it a little easier. And you want to encourage hydration. So you might have to add some electrolytes or a small handful of salt to your horse's feed to encourage drinking. I do give Dakota Himalayan salt in each one of, you know, twice a day. Just a little, but enough. And they, they, they drink adequate amounts. You can soak your hay or warm the water slightly, which helps too. It can also help during cold snaps. Now, what I love about those heaters, I mentioned the ones that we use outside the heated muck buckets is what they look like, is they do keep the water at a really comfortable temperature. So it does encourage a lot more, uh, ingestion of water. Hydration is just as crucial in winter as in summer. So you need to keep a close eye on your horse's water intake. Okay. If you have multiple people like we do that are rotating barn chores and feedings, we always, before we leave, we inform everybody else that this is how much water was ingested. Like it was down to a quarter of a bucket or trough. I've topped it off on and on and on and on and on. So we keep each other in the loop about forage intake, feed intake, and especially water intake. All right. Speaking of food, we need to touch on feeding for warmth. Because horses are natural foragers and digestion generates heat, making proper feeding a cornerstone of winter care. So here's what we need to focus on forage, forage, forage on cold days. You got to give your horses extra hay. It's their main heat source and it keeps their digestive system working properly. Obviously you're going to monitor body condition. You need to check your horses weight regularly. So that's where like having your horse under a blanket all the time. And if you're not pulling those blankets and sheets and all that and getting a look at your body, your horse's body condition, you might miss something. Okay. You need to use a weight tape or even just feeling along the ribs to make sure they're not losing condition. Winter supplements. Consider adding some fat sources like rice bran or flaxseed for the extra calories if your horse is struggling to maintain weight. And of course, a favorite, warm mash treats. Offering warm beet pulp or so-pay cubes can provide hydration and comfort on cold days. Just make sure it's not too hot. Every bite counts in winter. Plan your horse's diet to keep them warm and healthy. Now we're going to talk about turnout and safe turnout. Turnout is absolutely vital for a horse's mental and physical health, even in winter. But icy conditions absolutely can turn playtime into a hazard. So the number one thing you want to start with is you have to prepare your paddock. Clear the walkways and high traffic areas of any snow and ice or, you know, most of it. You can add sand or gravel or even a non-toxic de-icing agent for better traction. Snowball hoof care. Snow can compact into hard walls under their hooves and it can cause a lot of discomfort, guys. You want to apply a non-toxic hoof oil or spray to prevent buildup or even hoof boots if necessary. Monitor the weather. Extreme cold, wind or freezing rain may warrant keeping them in the barn, but they still need to get daily exercise. Let's not forget about the buddy system. Horses stay a lot warmer and happier when they can interact with their herd mates, so group turnout is ideal when it's safe. You need to balance safety with the benefits of fresh air and movement to keep your horse happy. And how about grooming and hoof care? Winter coats are nature's blanket, but regular grooming is still essential. It's about more than just appearances. Grooming is your chance to check for issues. And I do. That's why I do that every single day with Dakota. I'm checking his feet. I'm checking his legs for any inflammation. I'm checking for boo-boos. I mean everything. You want to focus on hygiene because mud, sweat and moisture can cause a lot of skin problems like rain rot. Use a curry comb and a stiff brush to clean their coats thoroughly like often. Don't forget about hoof maintenance. Pick those hooves daily to remove mud, snow or ice. Keep an eye out for thrush or cracks caused by wet and freezing conditions. Shedding tools. Oh, these are my favorite. For clipped horses, consider using fleece or wool coolers after exercise to wick moisture and prevent chills. I like the shedding tools and I do use them because most of them will separate the hair and get it to stand up too. And also when I see the shedding begin and that, let's face it, that can start in late February, early March. It's indicative of warmer weather to come. And you know, not for nothing, but your grooming routine, it's a great way to bond with your horse and ensure that they're ready for any kind of weather. You know, I love my time spent brushing Dakota and I know he enjoys it as well. You need to monitor for health. You got to do a visual because winter can amplify existing health concerns, especially for older horses or those with special needs. You should be proactive about their health and you can use these tips to do so. Regular vet checks. Ensure your horse is up to date on vaccines and deworming as winter can still bring parasites and respiratory problems. Dental care. Horses with dental problems can struggle to chew hay. You need to look for that, right? If you start seeing quibbing, which is where they've been chewing and chewing on hay and then they spit it out and you find these globs of wet or in the winter frozen chunks, walls of chewed forage that they didn't swallow, that's telling you there's some dental issues and you need to, because they need that forage guys, you need to make sure there's nothing going on in that mouth that their teeth are able to chew. If you have to start feeding soaked hay pellets to add extra forage, then that's what you need to do. You know, in our elderly citizens, chewing can become an issue. So we have to make sure we're we're looking for these signs and taking care of them. Schedule that dental float if needed. We're going to look at body condition scoring. So again, run your hands along the ribs, the back, the hips every week to monitor their weight. Early prevention is key. And again, we're going to go back to this blanket checkups. Remove those blankets every day. Inspect the skin and coat for rubs, sores, or even injuries. You just don't know. Prevention and early intervention are your best allies in winter horse care. You know, winter can be an absolutely beautiful time to enjoy with your horse. But it does take preparation and care. And by following these tips, you will keep your horse healthy, happy and thriving no matter how cold it gets. Gee whiz, yesterday was single digits. We still had fun.
