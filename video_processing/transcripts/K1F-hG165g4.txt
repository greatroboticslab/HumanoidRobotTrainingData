Education
 If any accidental spill occurs, then use the sand or sawdust in your spill kit to contain the liquid and absorb it. Do this as soon as possible and before it spreads too far, contaminates other surfaces or, if on the ground, penetrates below its surface. Scoop up the contaminated material and place it in the plastic bag that is then sealed and labeled for safe disposal later.
