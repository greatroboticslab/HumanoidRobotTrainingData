 Food safety concerns have recently gained attention in society. As part of the food industry, we recognize that certain national brands remain dedicated to producing food responsibly. Working as a junior factory employee, I've observed how basic dust prevention evolved into a more advanced liquid sterilization process. This phase is particularly interesting, using traditional techniques to create a visually impressive scene. Machines handle the next steps, transporting products via conveyor belts for quality screening. Syrup is added and mixed before baking in a long oven and cooling. A person monitors the process as machines fill and seal the packages. Our corn, harvested once a year in northeastern China, is carefully selected for popcorn production. This product blends tradition and modern craftsmanship, promoting healthier families and nostalgic flavors.
