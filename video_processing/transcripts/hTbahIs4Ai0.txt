 Remote sensing has become increasingly important for understanding and managing agriculture. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art and remote sensing for mapping cropping practices, focusing on crop succession, cropping patterns, and cropping techniques. Most studies have been conducted locally and rely heavily on ground data, while few have taken advantage of multiple sensors or incorporated expert knowledge. Future research should focus on developing more robust methods for mapping crops using satellite imagery, taking advantage of the Sentinel constellation and other emerging technologies.
