That means get out and look. Get out of the cab of the tractor, the sprayer, get out the field, look at what your tillage tool is doing, look at what your planter is doing, look at your seed depth, you know, all of those things, don't rely on all those monitors and fancy gadgets we've got in the cab or looking, you know, six feet above the ground from a glass bubble thinking, you know, that everything's okay. You need to get out and look. It also means get out of the pickup. Yeah. So if you're driving by a field and something doesn't look right, stop the pickup, literally get out and walk across the field. Yes. So planning depth. I know, you know, everybody's got the old timer pocket knife to pull out and that's how deep they plant or, you know, the old knuckle method, that's how we deeply plant or we use our digging tool about our planting depth. So what else can we do about checking planting depth? So if you want to look at your planting depth and you want to look at sidewalk compaction or how your row units are doing, typically what we use is a measuring tool like this. And you get out here and you start digging around. Well, when you're doing this, you're disturbing a lot of what has happened as a result of the planter or the tillage till going through the field. So you don't get a good idea of that. So one of the things we are going to use today is just this leaf blower to just start kind of blowing the loose soil off of where the row unit went so that we can look at the job the row unit was doing, what the closing wheels were doing and how the seeds placed in the seed trench. So. So here's an instance where we could see several different things going on in the row unit. So right here, you notice after we blew this off that we noticed this line here and that's where is a two by two nitrogen is going next to the next to the row. Here we have the seed trench, as you can see. So we've got a little bit, maybe just a little bit of sidewalk compaction, but notice it is loose for the most part. It didn't blow out with the leaf blower, but it is loose. The other thing that you can notice if you look really closely is you can see where the spike closing wheels have ran down through this unit. So overall we've got about a two inch and a half, two inch, around two inch planting depth. Not seeing a whole lot of information here or evidence that shows me that we've got much of any compaction happening. But, I mean, this is a good way to look at what your row units are doing and the conditions that you planted into to determine what kind of compaction you might have.
