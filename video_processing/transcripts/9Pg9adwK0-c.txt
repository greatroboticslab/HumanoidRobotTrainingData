 Mike Atchison's family nursery is in West Delray Beach. It's in Palm Beach County's Agricultural Reserve. He's also the president of the local chapter of the Florida Nursery Growers and Landscape Association. Mike and his group are hoping to convince the majority of the Palm Beach County Commission to vote no on the proposal to build 1,000 homes and 277 workforce housing units on a parcel of land in West Boca Raton. Atchison is concerned if GL Homes gets permission to build this new neighborhood off of State Road 7 in Western Boca, the rest of the farmland around here won't last much longer. I'm Jim Grimes.
