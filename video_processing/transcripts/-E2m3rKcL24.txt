 A south facing window is a great spot for not only houseplants, but other plants as well. Take this rosemary plant for example. It's great because it loves the sunlight. It's used to a Mediterranean climate, but we can also use it for cooking purposes. You're not also limited to just a rosemary plant. There's lots of other herbs that we can also plant in a south facing window. Treat them much like a houseplant and then we can use them whenever we're ready. Finding a location like a south facing window is critical. These plants need lots of light and it's also important to think about plenty of water and plenty of nutrients that are provided to these plants as well. Some other herbs that you might consider growing in a great location would be oregano, thyme, basil, chives, or cilantro.
