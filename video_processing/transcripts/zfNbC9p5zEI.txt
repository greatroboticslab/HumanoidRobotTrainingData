 Welcome to the life of an Illinois dairy farmer. The day starts around 4 a.m. with a glass of fresh milk, and then I head out to meet the cows. In our barn, we can milk 12 at a time, so 6 on each side. We make sure that the cow's teats are all nice and clean before we place on the machine. And then once the machine is placed on, it'll gently pulsate, allowing the cow to let down the milk. Milk will then flow into our whey jars, which will then flow into our bulk tank to be cooled and ready to pick up. After milking, we feed calves and complete any chores needed to be done throughout the day. Today, we spent a little extra time with Gloria's red baby calf that you see here. Then, once all the chores are completed, we start milking again around 4 p.m. Thanks for tagging along!
