Howto & Style
 one of the most important thing about microponics is that you have the number of chicken you have up there the ratio has to match the number of fish down there perhaps today we'll be discussing with you about microponics my name is Mark John I remain your host in Betel Farm where the fish are if you can look at it carefully we have our massive pump here our submersive pump is inside the water so from from the water the submersive pump takes it to to this filter here we build our mechanical filter and from our mechanical filter we have our biological filter this is where all the bacteria are formed after after the bacteria is formed it runs through the pvc pipe down to the grow beds and from the grow bed that is where the plant absorbs all the nutrients that is taken from the pond the fish pond and also after observing it it sends it back you can see the water comes back here as a clean water so that the fish can have good oxygen one of the most important thing about microponics is that you have the number of chicken you have up there the ratio has to match the number of fish down there so if you are putting if we put 10 chicken to 100 fish which is very important because if you miss the ratio the amount of the amount of chicken if we supersede that of the fish then the water will become so acidic and all your fish will die so it's it's 10 chicken to at least 100 fish in the pond depending on the number of depending on the size of the pond you want to build so your ratio has to be accurate about uh microponics so here what we do is that this pond right here is uh 22 meters by by 3 meters and we put 10 chicken 10 chicken to 100 fish so if we put two chicken 20 chickens that means we have 200 fish there so that is the ratio we use so that the water will never be acidic because it's very important that your water remains in an alkaline form so that is very important because from just as i said from this place here from the pond it goes to the mechanical filter from the mechanical filter to the biological filter and everything what the what the chicken release to the fish and the fish consume it and whatever the fish release it pass out to the plants and the plant in return absorb all the nutrients and in return send it back to the fish as a clean water why do we do this kind of farming it's very important microponics mimic natural ecosystem it encourages the growth of both plants and animal in a way that minimize environmental impact it reduces dependency on large-scale industrial agricultural practice making it more sustainable choice it's for food security microponics can be implemented in a small space making it suitable for urban environments small household or communities which is limited to land resources this makes it very valuable too for promoting local food production and improving food security particularly in urban areas or region with limited agricultural land yes so thank you so much this is our topic today on microponics because i wanted to educate you on more what we do with microponics and please i want you to subscribe to our channel better farm and hubs and please like share comment on the video and if there's any specific question you have please put it on the comment section let us know and if there's anything you disagree about feel free to contact us and we can talk about it thank you for subscribing and see you next time
