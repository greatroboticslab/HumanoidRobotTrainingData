 The need for spatialized information about agricultural practices is increasing due to agronomic, environmental, and economic reasons, and remote sensing can be used to map these practices. However, most studies are exploratory investigations that rely heavily on local knowledge and use only one type of sensor. Future research should focus on using land stratification, multi-sensor data combination, and expert knowledge-driven methods to improve the monitoring of cropping practices with new spatial technologies, such as the Sentinel constellation.
