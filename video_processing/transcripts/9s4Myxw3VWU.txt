 Welcome to the Northwest Weekly Agri Updates. I'm Sally Balmain, Livestock Officer with the Northwest Local Land Services Ag Advisory Team. Coming to you this week from the shelter of a hay shed because it seems every Tuesday the weather is atrocious at the minute. This week I just wanted to touch base and talk about bloat. So I get a lot of inquiry and I suppose concern about bloat for this spring. There seems to be a huge amount of clover in the pasture paddocks and also the loosens really on fire at the minute and whilst that's awesome and I guess sign of a cracking spring it can be really scary from a bloat perspective especially given the value of cattle at the minute. Bloat's a hard one because there's no magic bullet to controlling bloat unfortunately. We saw bloat capsules go off the market a few years ago and they've yet to return. So rumensin does have a label claim for bloat but you know in a loose lick form it really is difficult to get enough into them but it can help. So a loose lick that contains rumensin certainly won't do any harm but they mightn't be able to eat enough of it to get the full dose to claim bloat control. The other thing we can do if we have the luxury of other feeds to graze for the meantime is just hold off putting stock on pastures until the clover and the loosens in flower. It does tend to get a lot less risky once it has flowered. So if you are in that situation it might be worth holding off grazing for a little while. If not introducing stock gradually so just allowing stock access to the risky paddock for sort of an hour mightn't even be an hour so please don't set and forget put stock on there and really keep an eye on them for those first few days and see how they're going. And then also make sure the stock aren't hungry when they go on so even stock that have been successfully grazing a high legume content paddock a few hours in the yards to do whatever and then return to the paddock can be detrimental so please let them fill up on on safe feeds first. The other thing too is our pastures can get a bit less risky as the day progresses so instead of turning stock first thing in the morning give the plants an hour or two to photosensitise and things like that and that can help. If you are in a position where you've only got water troughs in your paddock medicating them with a bloat oil can be handy unfortunately for a lot of people though given the amount of rain we've seen there's so much surface water about that might not be an option but certainly products that contain bloat oil can help there's some licks and some blocks on the market that that do contain that product and it might be of assistance. The other thing to bear in mind is sometimes bloat and pulpit kidney can look the same in the end result which unfortunately is an animal legs up in the air and quite inflated so five in one is not a particularly expensive product to give so it might be worth giving stock a shot of that if they haven't had one in the last sort of six to eight weeks and you are in a high risk area a shot might might help and then a shot every six to eight weeks after that just for the pulpit kidney aspect the custodial vaccines are really good at everything else but the nature of pulpit kidney means that even if it's within the annual booster they still might need a shot or look at the product that's got the longer the longer pulpy kidney claim on it. As always the district vets are on hand to answer any queries that you have or feel free to contact the ag team we wish you luck and we hope everybody's staying well and safe at the moment and we hope we get to see you all around the trap soon cheers you
