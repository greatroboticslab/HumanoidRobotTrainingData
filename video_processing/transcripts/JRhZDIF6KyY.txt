 we're here for an interview with the sungo a tech agricultural corporation where they have a cool robot on display and we're gonna learn more about it hi how are you i'm jay nice to meet you can you tell me a little bit about your company and what you guys are showing today we are from south korea and we are agricultural corporation and we have a whole like smartphone solution system we are we have and this is our harvesting robot and this called Eve clever that that embedded the Eve system if system means that we are we have this dashboard so we can analysis the fruits like this is a ripen or unrippened and then it has like it has past disease or then we do not harvest okay harvest only the good quality like fruits so we have various rippers like this hands and like this three finger the one over yes and also Caesar type we have so when we when we harvest like strawberries or cherry tomatoes so we use this so first we cut the stems and then grab like grab stems and we so you have a different hand for different types of fruit this is one of the coolest robotic solutions I've seen your dashboard over here is it using AI technology yes right we use AI technology and we like collect the day like image data yes and we make the algorithms oh so there there you go you have an example of it as well so the hand can grab things like tomatoes and apples and then you have other thing oh or is this is this gum is this person man maybe it's person man maybe I got it wrong Tommy Joe yeah okay persimmon and apples over here that can then you have a cutter for strawberries and such so the name of the robot is Eve clever yes right and you said that it can detect whether the fruit is ripened or not yes right and if it has pesticide or not or any like disease in it so it only picks the best fruit yes right very cool is is this already available abroad is it only available in Korea at the moment or is it just in testing face we have the customer we have commercialized in 2024 okay and then we are planning to go abroad like Australia Israel or like Taiwan we are talking about and also Japan okay so would you need one robot per tree for example how would it work obviously this robot is able to harvest this tree but are you imagining like many robots in a line harvesting many trees yes we have like real time and also automatic time so this can when we have real and in harvest I see so if you have a line of trees it's not that you're gonna have one robot per tree it's on like a track or a rail and it moves down the track and harvest the trees yes right this is really cool okay so we're here at CS 2025 what is your big goal here we are planning to meet the seek the like agency American agency or we started IR okay so we want to meet some good investments so we want to develop more good quality systems okay so for that you're looking for investment and partners collaboration okay future business plans going forward are you wanting to break out into the American market first is that your main goal right now or what market are you approaching at the moment first we want to make agency and then we want to sell this product so all I like from whole America and also we had talk about like California California buyers oh I could totally see us being used in California so am I getting it right is it song ho a tech or okay so we're at song ho a tech here looking at their harvesting robot this thing is fascinating it uses AI technology to analyze data about fruit or other things that need to be harvested and it can tell if it's ripened or not if there's any disease or pest in it for example it has like three or four different hands maybe you'll have some more in the future that can either grab the fruit like this or cut the fruit and they're looking here in America for potential buyers investors and collaborators so this thing can basically move down a whole rail and harvest the best fruit possible that's why they're here today again we're at some ho a tech and we're looking at the robot named e cloud Eve clever come down check it out and get more information thank you so much for your time today thank you I really appreciate it
