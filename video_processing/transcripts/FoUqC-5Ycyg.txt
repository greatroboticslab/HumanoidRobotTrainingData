 yeah nice night to cut the grass let's go for it right guys lawn tractor good tire bad tire obviously got a puncture in this tire so in this video i am going to show you how to remove the wheel find the puncture find the hole and hopefully patch it and get it working as good as new right guys in order to get the wheel off of the tractor the first thing you need to do is obviously jack the tractor up somehow this is the way i do i usually um just tilt it on its side because it's fairly light and this is just a mountain field tractor push it up on the side rest it against something in the back there and you know just put a couple of steadies underneath and that way we can get this wheel off okay so on most lawn tractors you just have a plastic cap over the hub here so simply first first course action just pull that off should just prise off like that okay so in this case all we have here is the here's the axle it's a retaining clip and a washer so all we need to do is just force this clip out so we're using something like a small screwdriver like this we just lever that in and push it out and don't lose it like i just have there once you do that take the washer off and the wheel can then be wiggled off hopefully yeah you may find that yours yours may have a retaining nut you know just a normal nut on there or it may have a split pin whereas you would just have to you know remove the split pin similar situation and just get the wheel off okay so it should just be a simple case of sort of jiggling the wheel off so just there we go okay so obviously the first thing you need to do is uh pump the tire up so you can either use a compressor or in this case i'm just using my bicycle pump here it's perfectly adequate for a tractor tire so pump it up okay so obviously you get it up to substantial pressures to where the air will come out the hole there's obviously a hole on this tire somewhere so we'll get it up to pressure and that'll allow us to move to the next stage okay so what we want to do now is we need to get some sort of solution uh soapy solution so all i've got here is an old just an old spray you know for a flash or any like household sort of sprays that you get or you can buy one you know about a pound each or whatever um put a little bit of water in it and quite a lot of uh fairy liquid or you know any sort of detergent and what we want to do is just spray it all over the tire and just to see where we can see the leak so it's basically a homemade leak detector and we'll spray it all over the tire and then hopefully you'll see the air bubbles come out and then that way we'll be able to find the leak so just you know don't hang about just spray a lot there's a lot of this on keep spinning the tire so you should soon see the leak you know with this he says yeah you can see it there the commas picking up you can see the bubbles there so that's what you're looking for you're looking for a you know obvious escape of air on the tire you can see that yeah you see it there okay so again just spray it quickly see the big bubble here but we'll check again see it coming out there so we know that's the area so i'm keeping my eye on it what i'm going to do is dry this off and then mark it with a marker i was marked i could see the hole so i've just marked a couple of white marks and yeah see the hole there at the tip of my finger yeah so here's the tool kit here the repair kit yeah we've basically got a drill type tool here which you just pierce through the hole and just give it a rub and that cleans the area we've got a tool here where we thread through the actual plugs these are the plugs and effectively just rubber strips yeah with some sort of gluey liquid on the side i don't know it's a rubber or string or something but effectively they thread through this tool you force it through the tire and pull this out and it leaves the plug and then you trim it off and that's that's effectively it i'll show you how we do that now okay so what you want to do firstly you want to get this drill tool um obviously we've established where the hole is so what we want to do is just stab this drill through the hole and just you know pull it in and out just to sort of file the area and clean the area so there may be some air comes out when we do this but so just get it in twist it pull it out quickly and again pull it out just repeat this process you know five or six times so you've got a nice clear hole so hopefully you get a close-up here's the handle here's the tool right in there you can see it let's take it out slowly here we go and again so effectively filing the hole okay so what i do now is remove one of these strips from this packaging and so let's just pull this out uh like so and what we need to do is just thread this through this eyelet here if you see this eyelet what we do is thread this through it's quite difficult because it's quite tacky and it's quite rubbery so it's fairly stiff so it's going through now let's get it roughly halfway okay so how this works is the top edge of the eye it's obviously sealed so that allows you to force down into the tire but the top edge of the eyelet if you can see is not joined so once you get that plug into the tire and pull forcefully back you know on the tool like that this obviously opens up and you can releases the tool but leaves the plug in the tire and i will demonstrate that and then that's effectively it trim the plug pump the tire up check for leaks and that should be us i'll demonstrate that now okay so what we're going to do we're going this is just the drill yeah just marking where the hole is so we're going to take this out and we're going to place this in uh just a short distance and then yank it out quickly as i'll show you now so take this out find the hole with this push it in if you can see that it's probably i don't know halfway in and then what we need to do is just yank this out forcefully and quickly like that what that leaves you with is you can see the plug stuck in the hole and still see it marked where i had it marked and so what we need to do now is just trim these below the level of the tread with a craft knife and we'll blow the tire up again spray it with solution and just make sure the leak's gone okay so we've just got one of these craft knives what we'll do now is just trim these off obviously when you're doing this these knives are razor sharp so don't uh slash the tiger again and hold you back to square one but all i'm doing here is just i've got it just below the tread hold on to one end of the plug and just gently that's it just gently cut that off just pumped it up yeah we'll just spray some solution on now yeah you can see it's totally sealed just totally soak it see the plug there so that's it puncture fixed we'll get this up to pressure and we'll get the wheel back on the lawnmower right good idea where the wheels off just might as well just get a bit of grease so it's a smidgen of grease over there doesn't matter if you don't have any but i'm just doing it because the wheels off and simply fit the wheel back on okay so obviously once you get the wheel back on wash it on so clip push that in the groove use a pair of water pump pliers to squeeze this on so that's it you hear the click and hubcap back on dust cap yeah that's us that's it done right guys
