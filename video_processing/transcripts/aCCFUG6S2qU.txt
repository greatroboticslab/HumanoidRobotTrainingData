 Our food, our health, our animals, our environment, all connected in one system. And at the root of it, plants. They give us the oxygen we breathe, the food we eat, the feed our animals need. But plant health is under threat from plant pests, diseases, and climate change. When plants are in crisis, the web of life begins to unravel. A single pest outbreak can destroy harvests and fuel hunger, spread harmful pathogens, increase the risk of zoonotic diseases, and antimicrobial resistance affecting every one of us. But we can protect our plants through science, innovation, and global cooperation to make sure plant health is at the heart of One Health. FAO and the International Plant Protection Convention are leading the way, establishing global standards, advancing plant health policies, building capacities, investing in early warning systems, to put One Health into action. Join us in the global effort to protect plants and our future. When we protect plants, we protect One Health, we protect life.
