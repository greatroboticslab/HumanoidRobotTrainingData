Science & Technology
 Agriculture is the most fundamental and ancient activity that propelled human civilization as we know it today. Before agriculture, yeah, there were people, there were modern humans, but they formed groups of hunters and gatherers and they didn't build cities, they didn't build empires. So agriculture is perceived by many as a very conservative activity. However, it has been over the time characterized by a rate of innovation that was necessary in order to be able to feed the populations. And of course, the rate of population was statistically speaking exactly equal with the amount of calories that agriculture could produce at a given time. Because if you had more people and not enough calories, there would be starvation and death. This kind of cycle of overshooting population that will then go back to the sustainable level has characterized human civilization for thousands of years, tens of thousands of years. And it was invisible to most unless they were the one starving. people. And now we have a globally interconnected world. And we know when there is a food crisis somewhere. And hopefully we intervene, we help, we prevent famine and starvation to kill people. actually agriculture now is powerful enough in its ability to create the output edible calories that when there is famine, it is not due to lack of food, it is due to insufficient logistics or active prevention of the population being fed by civil war and conflict or corruption. However, the way that agriculture arrived to the point where it is today must change. The impact of agriculture on the environment must be ameliorated, must be lightened. The pressure that humanity puts on the environment is not compatible with our future. I was lucky to participate in the opening meeting of a new think tank, the think tank Farm to Fork, that was born to catalyze the rate of innovation and the rate of technology it is equal to blackhart's innovation olsun. This is how the humanitarian activities goes on course. So good, it is what I mean. There is a, a minute and this is something about the veggies' option which grants free money, especially them personally people. And what we need to consider when you see how to stay in the pitch for the bird's infrastructure. It is what we prioritize. It is what we need to talk about in history. We all need to think about highlighting sustainability and highlighting biodiversity. And actually, very explicitly putting in place incentives and objectives to reach this. In the way that every kind of activity in agriculture and food production is going to be influenced by it over the course of the next five years. The policies that the European Union puts in place matter worldwide because of how big a market it represents. Both in terms of how it produces food to be consumed inside or for export or its import of food from outside. And the size of the market also makes it so that the producers of technologies and components in Europe or outside of Europe that serve the European market are able to leverage that size in order to achieve both their financial goals as well as to be able to develop new products, new services that otherwise wouldn't be available. So, just a few examples of the things that we are seeing that are not only on the horizon but are already in agricultural practice today. The ability to plow at a depth that is much shallower than before in order not to disturb and not to diminish the fertility of the field. The simultaneous laying of tubes underground at a depth that is deeper than the plowing depth in order to irrigate the field with the right quantities of water enriched with the kind of nutrients that the particular plant needs. The opportunity is exactly where it is needed because of both satellite based and drone based monitoring of plant growth through data analysis and integration based on multispectral imaging. The opportunity is really enormous. Already the existing practices can improve farm productivity double digits 10-20% and more while diminishing drastically the use of water, the weight, the pressure of food production on the fertility of terrain and of course quite substantially diminishing also the use of chemicals that are the traditional fertilizers or pesticides, which contributed importantly in our ability to increase the level of food production we have today but where they are now being labeled or recognized as undesirable beyond a certain necessary level. The next stages of agricultural revolution again will come from technology. Imagine vertical farming that can be above ground or below ground that is proportional to the volume of the farm rather than the area of the field available. The availability of plant based meat substitutes that are being adopted and appreciated by consumers already or actually cultivated meat of animal origin obtained by cell cultures rather than growing an entire traditional plant. an entire traditional animal. These are just two examples but also advanced techniques like CRISPR in our ability to intervene and improve the basic crops and the basic ingredients of our food chain. There are obstacles. For example, in Italy today you cannot apply pesticides via drones which practice would be able to diminish the quantity put out quite radically because flying a drone even if applied small quantities very precisely because it flies a meter or two meters above ground is equated to blasting the crops with traditional spraying from planes and that is prohibited and as a consequence the use of drones is also prohibited. Or other examples where the regulations are not aligning the incentives in actually delivering the desired outcome. large quantities of food in large quantities of healthy food in great variety with as little environmental pressure as possible across not only Europe but the world. would also be able to diminish the least in general. and then of course, the most radical or polesim opuckle extra food practices are going to be on the moon. and the Mars and the asteroid belt. Environments where, well, you cannot grow corn or feed a cow with the corn that you grew. You cannot waste water. You cannot have almost any of the things that we are accustomed to have on Earth. The total, not only radical, but total sustainability practices that Moon colonies and Mars colonies are going to have will be not only advanced, but very valuable. And Earth agriculture is going to be profoundly influenced by those practices that Mars will be happy to sell to Earth and consult and advise on their implementation in the best possible way. The agricultural sector is something that I am not very familiar with, except eating food. And for me, it was a pleasure to start this collaboration with Think Tank Farm to Fork. And I am looking forward to the next meeting. I am looking forward to interact both with the providers of these exciting, interesting, existing, already being deployed agricultural technologies, as well as with the farmers that are the heart and really the passion that they put in their work of what they produce and we eat.
