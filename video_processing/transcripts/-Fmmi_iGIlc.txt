 Backyard composting can sometimes be a challenge. Figuring out a spot that's going to be warm enough, where you can access it with water to keep it moist, and then there's also that challenge of just keeping it corralled. If you're looking for a quick and simple option, you might consider building one out of 2x4s and a little bit of wire mesh screen. You can find these materials at local hardware stores for relatively low cost. Generally speaking, we want a compost container that is a minimum of 3 feet wide by 3 feet wide by 3 feet tall. For the backyard compost container that we're building today, we'll simply be using 2x4s that we attach together using a few 2-inch screws. We'll also then use some wire mesh screen that we'll attach with a few staples, build four sides, use hinges on each of the corners, and then we can actually shut that container and dump material in once it's all been built. Now we've selected the wire mesh because that'll actually help allow air movement into that compost pile. And then we went with the hinges so we can actually open that container back up later and actually stir that material around when needed.
