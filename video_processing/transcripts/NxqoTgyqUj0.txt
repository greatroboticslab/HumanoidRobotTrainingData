 So our electric PCS now has a subsoiler or a ripper tooth and here in the greenhouse very beginning of the season. Yes that is in fact the snowbank on the north side of the building. And we're trying to get these beds ready and for a couple years we've been loosening the soil by broad forking once a year but the opportunity came up to buy this single tooth subsoiler used and we're curious to know if we could make it work and it does. Oh, I ended up getting locked. I'll explain some of it. Okay, so my head corner marker is over here. A little bit wider. I'll block the diff this time. So I'm in second here. Looks like I'm able to go... The motor drivetrain has no trouble with it. I was running it in first gear and in second gear. I'm able to go... The motor drivetrain has no trouble with it. I was running it in first gear and in second gear. I'm able to go... And works down to about a 10 inch depth without any trouble. These are not the huge, the large BCS wheel and tire combo. I've ordered a big set because I think it would be nice to have a bit more traction and it'll also give us a slight speed bump that'll be handy with the electric drive given the way it's set up. So that's going to be later this summer. But this totally works. So these are the 5 inch by 10 inch wheels. They're about 20 inch overall diameter on a 10 inch rim. And... Yeah, the BCS is enough heavier with the two battery packs up front that I had to scrounge a piece of scrap steel to balance it. floors, this install. So let's use the TV II, we can Dobromo T 1 inch. Let's lift . We can add освd線 to the rest of the the island inside a this special處 location. Je one hundred here, it needs more strain on the electronics side of course, it really It's like, it's a little, that's about 10 inches, 10, 11. Promising.
