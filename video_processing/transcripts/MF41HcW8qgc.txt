 Good morning chickens! You're not coming in the house! Good morning modern status! I hope these chickens don't trip me. Man they're awful pushy in the morning. Morning in the house. It's another beautiful morning out this morning. 50 degrees. And it's supposed to be 87 for a high tomorrow. Figaro didn't want to come in last night but I think I hear him yelling at the door this morning. Good morning mister. You pulled an all-nighter? I'm going to get a little bit of a knife. I'm going to get a little bit of a knife. Mixed so you don't get any strings. I can hear the goats, Libby's. They're calling you. They're killing me. These100 have been stuck here. I'm not going to wear aكل. First는 what? Second, we got now.west, I'm not even fully clear any only 1st. I'll just turn it around and condor and microwave life. pro ah You just never know what you're going to be doing on a farm. One minute you're cooking banana bread. The next minute you're cleaning up your pig pen. Now as long as we have this covered up or mixed in with enough wood chips, wood shavings, straw, hay, carbon, you're not going to smell anything and it's going to compost nicely. Is it nice over here? Lynx. It's on a nice cool spot. Yeah. Now pigs like to go to the bathroom in one spot which is good and bad. It's easy to clean up. But it starts to get stinky in that area if you don't keep carbon there that you can pick up and haul off. I gave you a fresh bedding to play with. That's stuff you're just supposed to go to the bathroom on. One of the great things about having pigs and chickens is when you're emptying your refrigerator for the week. Or when you're baking and cooking with real food. You got all your food scraps. The pigs and chickens love it. You guys are so noisy. There's enough for you to be able to have your own side of the pile but they want to be right next to each other. Oh, you like them banana pails? Good stuff, huh? Good stuff, huh? Good stuff, huh? Good stuff, huh? Good stuff, huh? Oh, my goodness. You got it. Good stuff, huh? Good stuff, huh? Good stuff, huh? Good stuff, huh? Good stuff. Good stuff, huh? Good stuff, huh? Good stuff, huh? Good stuff, huh? They smell good, don't they? Smells so good. Smells so good. Smells so good. Woohoo! I want to try setting up an area for the goats to go run around in while we're home, so they can eat brush and clear up this area for us. What? What do you think of the chickens? Sausage. You like having them right there? Watch. Watch. Come on, do it. That one isn't tall. You didn't do it. You didn't do it. That one fell. You didn't do it. So if your marriage can withstand putting up an electric culture netting, it can withstand anything, right? Oh, what are you trying to say? This is a pain in the butt to do. That's what I'm trying to say. Don't you remember putting these up? No. It's usually a struggle. It's normal electric stuff. It's something I'melin'縦 Bet 걸. Thanks tovor and Here's the chicken. No, I asked for�� merk oh- Oh, it's probably not true. Uh Uh Uh. Pluto what do you need me to do? I don't know yet Just be patient right here It's a hard spot there. What the heck is this made out of cement? Some spots are hard, some spots are easy too. I'm not sure how to go. I'm not sure how to go. I'm not sure how to go. I'm not sure how to go. I'm not sure how to go. I don't think you guys are supposed to be in here. I don't. Are they getting in your territory? Are they in your territory? You don't care. You're a happy pig. Are you a happy pig? Huh? Ah yeah. is that an example of the dog? All right, we got it fenced in all the way around through the grove of apple trees. They got some raspberry bushes in there. It'll be interesting to see what it looks like after they're in there for a few days. We're only going to let them out when we're home, and we don't have time this afternoon to let them out, unfortunately. But tomorrow we'll be able to let them out and see how much fun they have. Would you like a fork? How do you want to eat it with your mouth? What's that? I like what you call a lazy sundae. Lazy sundae for us. For us, but it's not... It's our lazy... We're doing a lot for lazy. Yeah, but it's still our lazy sundae, right? Even though we got a lot done. It's kind of like what you call a lazy sundae. Leftover spaghetti. Yeah. I don't know if it's happened there. I'd say it's usually better when it's living over. Here piggy piggy piggy piggy piggy piggy. I see chickens. I know how they get in here without touching the left. They fly? Yeah, they fly onto the feeder. Do they? They fly onto the feeder? Yeah. Piggies! Where'd you go? Piggies! Where'd you go? Piggies! Piggies! Piggies! Lazy butts. Go wake them up. Way down here sleeping on top of each other. Piggies! Bye Piggies! What are you girls doing? Piggies! Come here piggies! Come here Piggies! Come here Piggies! There you go! Wait a minute. You have to go. Come here. There you go. Come here. Piggies! There you go. What do you think you're a goat and you gotta stay inside the fence? You girls need to stop playing with your ball. Larisa's got some cucumber peels for you. Aw, she likes it. Blossom. Oh no, Willow. You already had yours. No, you already had yours. Eat it. I guess Willow gets it all. You want to try it, Blossom? Nope. Willow's too fast. This is where we're going to end today's video. Tomorrow we'll let the goats out and see what they do with all the brush and shrubs under the apple tree. Can we see you guys right back at tomorrow? Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
