Education
 Let me show you my favorite plant books. Root, Nurture, Grow. What I love about this book is that it focuses on propagation only. So we will find step-by-step instructions for different propagation methods, as well as a very useful table that provides which method is best for each plant. The Well-Guardened Mind. This is a beautiful book, and I can tell you it's helping me discover how the relationship with my plants can help me improve the relationship with myself. Living with plants. My favorite part of this book is that it gives us ideas on how to display our plants and really step-by-step instructions on plant DIY projects. Gardening under lights. I can tell you this was a lifesaver last winter because it has all information a plant beginner needs about grow lights and how not to kill your house plant. With care guides for more than 100 plants and pictures of all of them just in case you don't know the name of yours.
