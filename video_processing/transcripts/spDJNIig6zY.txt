 Hi, my name is Carl Hoppe. I'm the Extension Livestock Specialist at the Carrington Research Extension Center. And today I'm going to visit about feed rations for backgrounding cattle, and this is the fall 2020. This is brought to you by NDSU Extension. Well, new calf crops are here, 2020. Time to place them on feed and look at what type of calves we have. You know, these January born calves are going to be big. These April and June born calves are going to be smaller. So we got a little bit of everything out there in the pen. We have different colors, we have different types, sexes, bulls, steers, heifer, hopefully most of them are castrated if they're going to the commercial market. And there's just a lot of differences out there, but it's a new year and a new season, a new group of calves that need to be placed on feed. A couple comments here. Traditionally in backgrounding calves, we grow cattle and it takes feed. In the Northern Plains, we're a backgrounding state. If we're in the Southern Plains, we would still have grass or some type of feed resources out there in which to graze. So in the Northern Plains, it ends up being a feeding state. So that's kind of the difference between backgrounding and stocker cattle. Backgrounding means we're feeding them for a period of time after weaning. Now the feed prices follow the corn price. That's traditionally what's been going on and it continues to go on that way. So as corn prices are increased, so does the overall prices of other feedstuffs increase as well. Let's go through some examples. Take a walk back in memory lane. I like to I like to reflect on these just to have an idea of what prices were just a few years ago because, you know, we tend to even remember, we only remember about a year back, so not even that far at times what happened. But in 2017, our corn prices $2.88 a bushel. And our distillers grains was $113 a ton. Hays were anywhere from $65 to $85 a ton depending upon what it was and wheat minces were at $95. And at that time, we still had barley malt sprouts in the region in which to feed. In 2018, the price of corn went up to $3 a bushel. Hays remained about the same. Price of distillers grains went up slightly as well as wheat mids and barley malt sprouts were not available in North, made in North Dakota at least. Now for 2019, just last year, the price of corn did go up another 10%. Hays remained about the same price. Wheat mids were a little bit lower. And, and distiller grains reflected the corn price and it increased as well. Now let's see what's happened for 2020. Corn prices increased slightly. Hay and both alfalfa and grass hay, at least this is alfalfa hay for steers, for beef cattle, not necessarily for dairy cattle, have remained the same compared to previous years. Wheat mids has creeped up just a little bit. Distillers grains has increased quite a bit. There's been a demand for distillers grains and the price is up. Canola mill prices are up as well. And the price of corn silage, because the price of corn has increased, the price of corn silage has increased as well. Must make note, we have a lot of processing plants in North Dakota. Some states don't have this opportunity that we have. But if you're located in the right location and you need some supplemental feeds, the price of these feeds along with your freight might make it very competitive to bring that into your feed yard. If you're in western North Dakota, you've got a lot of freight compared to being located in eastern North Dakota. Distillers grains is quite prevalent throughout the lower part of North Dakota and even in the South Dakota. So the amount of co-product feeds from distiller grains is quite readily available, as well as wheat mids. And we have oil crushes throughout North Dakota that would make soybean meal, canola meal, sunflower meal, those types of things where the oil has been taken out. We do have sugar processing plants in the state, sugar beets that is, and they produce beet pulp. We used to have tailings, but most of those might be going through the new ethanol plant that's producing up in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Here's just a rundown of the co-product feeds in North Dakota rather than a map. As I said, we've got five different distiller grain plants, five different ethanol plants that produce distiller grains in North Dakota, and actually several more throughout the region. They produce both wet, which would be like 60 percent moisture, modified, which is 50 percent moisture, and dried, which is basically a dried 95 percent dry matter feed. Sometimes they produce what's called corn syrup, but its real name is condensed distillers solubles. Most of these plants put this back onto the distillers grains. That's why it's called distillers, distillers grains with solubles. Although most of the time we just shorten it up and say DDGs, which is dried distillers grains, or just distillers grains if we're talking about the wetter modified. And for those people that do get distiller's grains with solubles, excuse me, condensed distillers solubles, they just call it corn syrup. Not to be confused with the corn syrup that comes out of a fructose refining plant, a wet corn milling plant, like there is down in Wahpeton, North Dakota. But that usually goes to the human food industry and not to our livestock feed. So usually we're talking corn syrup and livestock, it's always distiller grain. We do have wheat middlings in North Dakota. The North Dakota mill and elevator is the largest mill in the world in one location. And of course, we, the taxpayers of North Dakota own the state mill and elevator in Grand Forks, and they're very competitively priced when it comes to wheat middlings. Of course, we have a mill up in Minot, Carrington, and Fairmont, and even some milling is done up in Can-do. Raleigh Malt sprouts is only done in, is it done out of state now in, in Moorhead. We don't have a mill, a sprouting plant. Well, it's closed now, has been for several years in North Dakota. We do have a corn gluten feed plant or a fructose plant, wet corn milling plant that produces corn gluten feed as well as corn gluten meal. Meal is about 60% protein. Usually goes into a lot of our dog food type diets, pet diets, not so much into our animal diets. But corn gluten feeds widely utilized in the dairy industry and can be in the beef industry too. The plant now produces only wet product. That's how much the demand there is that we produce the dry. We do have a couple of potato fry flossing plants in North Dakota, one in Grand Forks, one in Jamestown. If you're on the list to get it year round, you are probably their favorite customer. It's really hard to get this product in the off season, but it is available depending upon what the supply is. Beet tailings, again, that used to be readily available, but now with the ethanol plant located up in Grand Forks that utilizes potato waste as well as tailings, beet tailings, that they might be more difficult to get a hold of. Beet pulp is still available when the dryers can't catch up or meet the demand of drying down beet pulp. Of course, our mills, canola mill, linseed mill, which is from flax, sunflower mill, and soybean mill are produced at several plants across North Dakota. A couple of these plants are swing plants where they produce other, it depends upon the time of the year that they're crushing what particular items. Right now, we don't have a mill in North Dakota that is crushing soybeans. So consequently, there would be no soy hulls available in North Dakota. But if you go across the border into South Dakota, there is plenty of mill and hulls available in Aberdeen. Of course, there's always screenings that are produced everywhere, but be sure to watch out for weed seeds that might be in screenings. The favorite one now is Palmer amaranth or Palmer pigweed. And if those seeds are in some screenings that are brought in from out of state, you have just created a very weed herbicide resistant plant into your fields or your feedlot. And just be careful about what you're buying when you're buying screenings. If they're locally from North Dakota and sourced locally from North Dakota, that problem shouldn't be there with noxious weeds. It can't be controlled with herbicides. Let's talk a little bit about cattle now. There is a daily nutrient need for certain feed ingredients for cattle. I'm going to try to lay out here that our most expensive costs for feeding cattle is in feeding what we call energy. That'd be the starch and the fiber that the animals digest and utilize to make their bodies grow. A lot of times you talk about proteins, but in reality, it's the energy that costs the most. And we do buy protein supplements to meet the needs. But usually energy is the biggest expense. So let's just use some assumptions. We have a 700 pound steer. He's eating 3% of body weight. And that would calculate almost 18 pounds of dry matter feed. And if we look in the energy world, we can utilize two different terms to describe the amount of energy the animal needs. It's either in mega cals of net energy for gain, or simply placed as PDN, which refers to as total digestible nutrients. Well, for easy math, we can use the 14.12 pounds of TDN needed by the animal. And in order to get that, the cost of energy, when you look at the price of corn, and just do the calculations for the cost per pound of TDN, it comes up to be 5 cents per bushel. So this example, 14 times 5 gets 70 cents a day for the energy cost to feed an animal, a 700 pound steer. Now they need 13.1% crude protein in their diet. And if they're eating 18 pounds of feed, that roughly means 2.33 pounds of crude protein is needed per day. Crude protein, if you look at the soybean meals or the other meals, it's 18 cents a pound in this example, which means it costs almost 42 cents a day just in protein costs. So just in that calculation alone, we spend more money in energy than we do in protein. But think of this, when we buy corn, we buy 80, almost 90% of the corn is energy, but to 8% of that corn or nine, or maybe even 10% of that corn is going to be protein. So if we need 13% protein in the ration, and we bought corn and hay, that averages 10% protein, we only need to add an extra 6 tenths of a pound of crude protein a day. So my math down there is 2.33 minus 1.74 pounds, that's the amount of protein that is in the feed that we bought for the energy. So we need to provide an additional 6 tenths of a pound of protein to the cattle. At 18 cents a pound, that means we spent a penny, excuse me, a dime. So energy cost in this ration would be 70 cents. The additional protein cost in this ration is 10 cents. And for those of you that wonder about the cost of water, rural water would cost maybe 2 cents depending upon what your rates are in your location and the cost and amount of water they drink. But I like to point that out that water is actually a very cheap part of our ration. But energy is most expensive. And protein, while we usually talk about protein a lot, we do need protein to aid in digestion. It's really only a small percentage of the total amount of feed that we provide their animals on a daily basis. Let's calculate some numbers for feed value. In other words, cost per pound of nutrient. The two big nutrients here are going to be crude protein and TDM. Let's take the first example, canola meal. It's 90% dry matter. Let's use the math on an as-fed basis and crude protein and canola meal on an as-fed basis is 38.7%. The cost per ton as-fed would be $255 a ton. The cost per pound then is 12.7 cents. You take the 0.127, divide that by 0.387, that's the 38.7% crude protein. And we end up with a 29-cent cost per pound of protein. That's how we calculate cost per pound of protein coming out of a feed cell. Now, we do the same thing in calculating cost per pound of TDM, except we use that 1.27 and divide it by 0.621. That's the TDM energy of the canola meal. And that ends up with 0.84. We do the same math for wheat mints, corn grain, and distillers. And as you look through there, what's the cheapest cost of a TDM? We normally think corn grain's the cheapest cost of TDM, and that's exactly what our math turns out to be. It's fairly cheap and it's a fairly low cost feed. Wheat mints is right behind it, fairly close, and distillers grains are somewhat competitive. Now, if you look at canola meal, that is definitely not an energy source that we'd use in our rations because of the high cost for energy. Now, let's look at the cost per pound of protein. Where's our cheapest cost per pound of protein? It's actually in the distillers grains. And then wheat mints, and then canola meal. No, actually, our cheapest sauce is distillers grains, then canola meal, then wheat mints, and of course corn grain would have a very high cost per pound of protein because it's not utilized for protein as a protein supplement. It's utilized as an energy supplement. So, if we need energy, we look towards corn. If we need protein, we usually look at protein supplements like canola meal. However, distillers grains can almost be considered one of those that's both a protein supplement as well as an energy source. And quite frankly, wheat mints falls in the same category too. So, when you start looking at rations, please keep these in mind as two co-product feed sources that can help balance a ration. Before I get into rations, I'd like to talk about some feed issues in North Dakota 2020. This year, corn silage wasn't as difficult for harvest as it was in previous years, like last year, but we did end up with an early frost the first part of September. We've been kind of used to having a frost that doesn't show up until the first part of October. So, we lost about a month worth of growth. And of course, when it freezes, corn choppers are, they want to have every, everybody's asking for them to show up their place now because corn is ready at that particular time. So, the amount of delay you have from the time it froze to the time it actually gets chopped affects the moisture content of the feed. And that in turn can affect the feed value. So, I always encourage you to feed test. Drier silages, like this picture where the corn was froze, and you can see that kind of a light green color in the corn. It dries out and there will be some poor fermentation due to X and that'll lead to excess heating. So, I like this temperature gauge. It's a three foot long gauge that you stick into the silage pile and it tells you what the temperature is. Just a few weeks after chopping, it was only at 82 degrees. About a month and a half later, it went up to 100 degrees, which indicates there's more air or fermentation going into the pile because of the lower moisture content. One of the issues that I've ran into this year is dry edible beans. It appears there's enough moldy and discolored beans that producers of dry beans can't sell them or market them. Consequently, they've offered these to beef cattle producers. Say, can you use those? And in reality, we can. Unfortunately, we can't use a lot. Some of the research projects have shown that if you feed at a high degree, you can actually like 20, 30 percent, even more of the diet, the cattle will just stop eating. So, the recommendation comes down to limit to 10 percent of the rations. You might be able to go up to 20 percent, but watch cattle performance and if they don't decrease in performance, continue on. Here's the things you'll see with cattle. There'll be digestion issues, probably some scours, decrease feed intake, and actually downright feed refusal. Remember one project using Great Northern Bean, Great White, Great Northern Whites, and the cattle actually at, I think, 30 or 40 percent of the ration just stopped eating the ration and wouldn't eat. They actually had to discontinue feeding that because, you know, animal health, they'd die if they won't eat. So, cattle might eat it for a little bit. Be careful how much you can put in. I suspect if you wanted to cook these, you could probably eat more, but cooking beans before feeding the cattle probably isn't a realistic thing for us in the Northern Great Plains. Here's some rations for feeding cattle. For the next four slides, we're going to have different rations for 700 pound steers and different rates of gain and correspondingly different feed costs. The first one is simply 13 pounds of grass hay and we need some protein and energy to add to it in order to get enough gain because grass hay itself won't provide a 2 pound a day gain. But 13 pounds of grass hay and then 7 pounds of wheat mids will give us a 2 pound a day gain. The rations around the 64 percent TDM, the cost of feed per pound of gain is 42 cents. If you look at a little bit better gain, we have to change our ration around. We got to increase some alfalfa hay, actually pick up some wheat mids. Why did we increase alfalfa hay? Because alfalfa hay has got calcium in it, while wheat mids is really high in phosphorus. And without the adequate 2 to 1 or 1 to 1 ratio of calcium to phosphorus, you can end up with urinary calcali in cattle. You don't want kidney stones in cattle, so you need to balance the ration for calcium phosphorus as well. This is a real deal. Most of the time we don't have a problem with it, but it certainly can if the rations are improperly balanced. Okay, so this particular ration will give you 2.6 pounds per day gain and 37 cent cost of gain. Please note that as our gain increases, our cost of grain decreases. Now let's just use a ration that's got, we go from 2.6 to 2.8. That's not much, is it? That's just a, just a few more pounds. In this ration, we used 8 pounds of hay, grass hay, 12 pounds of wheat mids, and we had to include limestone in an ounce per head per day just because of the extra calcium needed in this ration because wheat mids are high in phosphorus. We need to add extra calcium. So a 2.8 pound a day gain, feed cost is 35 cents per pound a gain. Again, as we pick up the rate of gain, our cost of feed, our cost per pound a gain tends to go less. Now here's another set of rations. Say we put up a lot of corn side, we had alfalfa hay, so alfalfa hay is the queen of forages. Corn side is the king of forages. In this example, 8 pounds of alfalfa hay, 29 pounds of corn silage. You might think that's a lot of feed, but that's 29 pounds of wet feed, which would be what's one third of 29, maybe 10 pounds of dry feed. So they gain 1.8 pounds on this particular ration and feed cost is 0.48. That's $35 ton corn silage and $90 ton alfalfa hay. Now let's cheapen this up with some grass hay and corn grain and wheat mids. And in this particular example, we've got 2.6 pounds per day gain, feeding 6 pounds of hay, 4 pounds of alfalfa hay, 2 pounds of corn grain, and 8 pounds of wheat middlings. And our feed cost per pound to gain is 38 cents. Again, as we increase the gain, the cost of the gain goes down. And if we tweak this ration a little bit more, so we're giving them even more corn grain and less alfalfa. They're only going to eat so much. So we have to, if we give them more corn grain, we're going to have to back something out of the ration. So we give them less grass hay and a little less wheat midds. And now we've got 3 pounds a day gain, and our feed cost per pound again is 3.6. So again, the same true message rings true. 3.6. So that as we increase the gain, the cost of the gain goes down. Please note that corn size, I always get this comment, wow, I'm feeding a hell out of pounds out there. Can they eat that much? And the answer is yes, because it is mostly water. They're not going to be drinking as much water because they ate it in their feed. Okay. Now here's another ration, a simple alfalfa hay and corn grain. No wet feed here. We can feed an all dry ration. This particular one would be 2.3 pounds a day gain, and our feed cost is 46 cents. Let's go backwards a slide for a second. But maybe I can't. Now we've got another ration that's alfalfa hay at seven pounds, corn grain 11.5. And then because we're not feeding enough alfalfa hay and quite a bit of corn grain, we need to add a provide and a protein supplement. And it's going to have extra calcium in it as well. So it's going to be 1.5 pounds of that particular feed. And then we're going to get a 3.1 pound a day gain. And it's going to cost us 46 cents per pound of gain. If we tweak this ration a little bit more and decrease the alfalfa hay and increase the corn grain of a couple pounds, we'll get a little bit better gain at 3.4 and our feed costs are now down to 42 cents. Well, now let's do another ration using grass hay and distillers grains. 15. Grass hay, 5 pounds of distillers. Feed cost is going to be almost 5.50 cents per pound of gain. If you look at grass hay, corn grain and distillers, we're at 38 cents. And if we look at grass hay, corn grain, distillers and limestone, because we're feeding quite a bit of distillers and quite a bit of grain and we're not getting calcium anywhere else, but it's got to come from limestone, all of a sudden we're at 35 cents. We've got quite a spread going on here at cost of gains. Anywhere from 50 cents down to 35 cents. And when you're doing your budgets, this certainly comes into consideration of what type of profit you'll make because if you're paying for feed and not getting gain, you need to be careful of how you're doing things. Now, we should talk about rates of gain in cattle. Low rates of gain are considered less than two pounds a day gain. That works quite well for cattle that are going to be heading for grass cattle. It also works quite well for replacement heifers. We don't need to have a replacement heifer weigh 1300 pounds when she goes out on grass. She's probably going to go backwards, lose weight if that's the case. So if we have her at 1.8 pounds a day gain throughout the whole winter and going up the breeding season, she'll be in good condition, weigh the appropriate rate. Roughly heifers should weigh 80% of mature weight at their first calving and 80% of their first calving weight at breeding. So we're looking at an eight to nine weight steer, excuse me, heifer, when it gets to be breeding time. And a lot of times if you do the back math here, 100, 150, 180 days on feed at a pound and a half a day will give us enough weight on these heifers to make them into breeding season without spending too much money on feed and getting them too fleshy. Because we are inventorying them until they're breedable and ready to go out to grass. If you're looking to grow cattle without adding too much condition, and condition is referred to as fat, two to three pound average daily gain is where we look at. Three pounds a day for 60 days as compared to two pounds a day for 100 days. Different ways to grow cattle. Remember if you feed them really heavy, you might end up with fleshy cattle, which leads us to the next life rate, which should be greater than three pounds per day average daily gain. That's almost what we call a finishing ration. And it really would be we can feed it to young calves have just been weaned, they're just going to get fat at an earlier age. And if you're looking to get them harvested less than a year of age, this might be the way to do it. However, feedlots like to buy cattle that have not been fed at these higher rates of gain, because it might reduce subsequent feedlot performance. However, some cattle are genetically disposed to gain well even without any loss of performance, and can grow and grade extremely well, even if they're fed at higher rates of gain. So if you know what type of animals you have, you might be able to get this by, get by with this, and it works quite well. Especially if you're looking to get animals and you can feed them on your own farm until finish. This is something that we do routinely on calves that are brought in weighing five, six hundred pounds and trying to be sold at 11 to 12 months of age, which can be done. It just needs to be pushed. You need to look at the historical performance of the cattle, what type of cattle they are. That'll give you insight of how you want to manage these. Of course, the next piece of the puzzle is what is the market price going to be at the time that you're looking to sell these cattle. And usually most of our spring born calves get fed to be dead come the summer of the next year. And that's usually when the market low is. So we try to background cattle or feed cattle to avoid marking them into that particular time frame. Otherwise, we end up getting a lower price. So we can target calf gain with a balanced ration. I always think of a balanced ration where we have adequate amounts of energy and protein to give us our better gains and feed efficiency. But when we're looking at a target weight, I think about that as being the ideal issue of back grounding. So we wean calves and want to feed them for two months so we can get them sold after the first year, we might have three pounds average daily gainers that go full and that'd be 180 pounds on these calves. Or we might be looking at selling these calves six months from now into the grass cattle market. That would be come April and people would be looking for those calves and there's usually quite a price for green type calves and green I mean under flesh calves that time of the year. And 1.5 average daily gain for 120 days is going to be 180 pounds. So in these two scenarios, we feed for 180 pounds, but we certainly change the market window by quite a bit. And of course, different market windows can lead to different prices. You can source core product feeds in different locations. There is an info sheet on this website that shows where there is selected prices of core products that are produced in North Dakota with home members and a spot market price available there. Let me just note that we can contract feed prices to cattle and they're usually low during the summer times. And if you can put in, if you can estimate what your need is for the fall time, you can probably get into a contract at that lower price rather than waiting for the spot price that usually gets higher after the first year whenever people start feeding. Big issue is when it comes to feeding co-products is how far the freight, how far you are away from the plant or in other words, how much freight there is. Some people haul wet product hundreds of miles and I always have to do the math and wonder why they are doing that. There must be other reasons other than cost to feed. Maybe they're looking for a wet product. Maybe they've got a trucker or somebody they're trying to keep in business. The real issue though is we can't afford to haul wet feed too far because the high price of trucking. After a while it gets to be cheaper to haul dry product if we're hauling it. It's even cheaper if we raise it on our own farm and produce it that way. Usually for backgrounding cattle we look for high fiber feeds and a lot of these co-products are high in protein as well. A lot of our hays are usually a little bit lower in protein so by adding in a co-product it mixes well with our hays to increase the protein sources. Please think about good feed bunk management, good feeding management for your calves. This is the opportunity for you to train them on how to develop their behavior of eating out of a feed bunk, when to eat, develop their routine and that'll stay with them. So far mother has been doing, the mother cow has been doing that to the calf. They graze in the morning and graze at night. Now it's your opportunity to train these cattle on how they are going to be fed. We don't want to just keep the feed bunks full. That means they can eat whenever they want to, which we do want is to have the feed bunks filled to what the animal's intake will be for the day and then we put in new feed for what their intake will be the following day. Try to have the bunks cleaned up. We usually practice what I call slick bunk philosophy. That's where when you come out to feed in the morning their bunks should be all slicked up. Cattle have eaten everything they need and now they're ready to eat more. And please practice that. One of the big issues we run into is when you have variable intake, they eat a bunch today, not so hungry tomorrow, then they eat a bunch on the second, third day, not so hungry, they eat a bunch more on the fifth day. In doing so creates kind of a yo-yo effect and the animal's steady state condition and rumen fermentation goes haywire and the cattle are not as efficient in digesting that food as compared to having a meal every day at the same time. Don't forget bedding. We've done research at the Carrington Research Extension Center that shows where bedding can improve average daily gain in these calves and and it's not because they're eating the bedding, it's because it's a nicer environment for them to lay on. Water should be kept clean so cattle will be readily willing to drink it. Try to reduce the amount of mold you feed the cattle. If you do feed it, you'll notice there will be digestive upsets especially in these young calves that are just developing onto a new ration. You can keep cattle healthy whether it means antibiotics in the feed with a veterinary feed directive or working them through a shoot and giving antibiotics if they're snotty or just pre-vaccinations. There's a lot of things you can do to keep cattle healthy and when healthy cattle are healthy they consume lots of feed and grow very well. Adapt to ration slowly. In other words we start with a step up ration one that's higher in forage and lower in energy content and as the cattle are filled up we after three or four days or a week or two weeks we bump them up to a higher energy ration the step up ration that would have a little bit more grain in it and then we might do that two or three times depending upon what our goal for rates of gains are. We just don't dump a whole bunch of grain out there and hopefully they don't get acidosis and die on you. That certainly is something that can happen so that's why balanced rations and step up rations are certainly utilized by nutritionists and it works quite well. The old thumb rule way of feeding is you give them a couple pounds of grain along with all the hay they want to eat and then in two days we give them a couple pounds of grain and another half a pound of grain and do that plus the full feed of hay. We do that for a few days and when they're adapted to that ration then we increase it again by another half a pound for two days and keep moving up the grain part of the ration until the cattle have matched your target goal ration that you're using for whatever gain it is we're looking for. Again bounce a ration. There's lots of feed nutritionists whether it be your county extension agent or a feed company that provides this service there's lots of ways to put the rations for cattle and let's not forget there are the things that can improve feed efficiencies in cattle. Anophores, Raventz and Bovitek can improve feed efficiency by five to seven percent. Implants, the ear implants can increase average daily gain because there are steroids that'll increase it by five to seven percent and your feed per pound again can be improved by five to twelve percent. These things can also control coccidiosis. If you ever run into a coccidiosis outbreak in a group of cattle you'll wish that never happened and you will do anything in the future to prevent that from happening and use the anophores or declinate or co-rid our options to our feed things that we can add to the feed prevent coccidiosis. Of course coccidiosis is usually an opportunistic type thing that always develops after a stress. So if you have a blizzard that would be a stress cold weather can be a stress commingling cattle together is new stress just being weaned can be a stress. So pack all these stresses on top of each other and coccidiosis might break out especially if you make a diet change or a ration change higher in energy. That can lead to an additional stress. So only one stress at a time don't stack them up and make them endure and then you end up with a health issue. Well in summary here let me just say that it looks like feed prices are higher this year and it's true this year is in other years higher average the other gains usually have a lower cost per pound again. We have lots of options out here in developing rations. We tend to always use distillers grains and rations because of where it's priced and the availability and it is quite available quite available but there are other feeds that are available out here too and we can use those if that's what you need. Co-products are usually higher in protein and fiber and actually work into a back grinding ration very well. In a finishing ration maybe not so much because they just don't have the overall energy density to be included at a high rate in the in the ration but certainly a smaller percentage could work. And again your management in feeding goes a long way to good calf gains. If they're used to being fed at eight o'clock in the morning keep them fed every morning at eight o'clock making different changes going a little bit earlier going a little bit later all leads to behavioral changes in cattle that can lead to poorer gains.
