Education
 Feeling Introduced Thank you. Let me start a new topic on the furrow irrigation system. We will look into the details of the furrow irrigation system, the design aspects, the various design parameters which are required for the detailed design. But before we do that, I will like to establish a relationship between the various elements, which are advance time infiltration and depo collation. This relationship will be a general purpose relationship which will be used for all these surface irrigation methods. Even the border irrigation method which we have considered earlier, this will be applicable to that. This will give you a general understanding that how these items are advance time infiltration and the depo collation are related to each other. And these relationships you can exploit for the design purposes. So this will be a very important way of looking at the overall process. Let us take the Caustico relationship which we had defined earlier and this gives the infiltration depth, the accumulated infiltration depth with respect to the opportunity time and these two parameters which we had defined. Ca and alpha are the empirical constants of these parameters. We had also seen that how we can derive these parameters from the absorbed infiltration data which was taken in the field. So these are basically defining the type of soil for each type of soil these parameters are known. Ca and T is nothing but as the infiltration opportunity time. In other words, if I write T, I can write this T in terms of Y and these two parameters. I can approximate this T which is the infiltration opportunity time to this T here as we have used, this T is nothing but infiltration opportunity time. Which means that at the surface of the ground for how long the water was available and for how long the infiltration opportunity was prevailing. So accordingly the depth of infiltration can be determined depending on what is the time of infiltration or what is the time for which at least that assumption is valid that the amount of water is more than the infiltration opportunity or the infiltration capacity. Those things we have seen and since in irrigation when we are applying the irrigation waters, we are ensuring that the depth of irrigation is always more than the infiltration opportunity or the infiltration capacity prevailing at that point. So we can make an approximation that this time can be approximated to the time of irrigation. So when we find out this time, the T, T now may be taken as the required time of irrigation. So what assumption we are making is that the time of infiltration opportunity is equal to the time of irrigation. So indirectly we can find out that time if we know the characteristics of the soil. So this relationship is known which we have already looked at. Now let us assume that the soil is, we make two more assumptions. First the soil is uniform, that means the soil characteristics are not changing for that particular field which is in question and we also make another assumption that the initial moisture content is uniform. So making these two assumptions, let us take that the distance, Z, we take Z as the vertical distance, the distance Z from the soil surface to the depth of wetting. So if we, when we, when we, when we, when we irrigate the soil, when the infiltration will take place, the wetting front will move. So if you want to express that wetting front in the form of distance Z, then this distance Z can also be expressed, it can be expressed as a function of Y. Okay. That will be proportional to, with some proportionality constant. If K is, then I can express Z with respect to Y. Then I can express Z with respect to Y. And if I substitute Y from the, the Kostikov equation, this can be expressed as this Ct to the power alpha, alpha into K. Now this, these are two constants. I can express this as a new constant which is K dash, K to the power alpha. Let us take two more quantities. So this, Tt is time required for advance curve, end of the field. And if Tn is the time required to infiltrate. So this is the net irrigation requirement, which is Yn. So to achieve the net irrigation requirement, if you need the time Tn, that is the time which is required to get this net depth of irrigation. And Tt is the time of advance of the waterfront to reach the downstream end. So what are the various options available to you? It depends on your type of soil as well as the length of the field. So what will be the value of Tn? That what will be the value of Tn? Or what is the proportion of Tt of Tn which is required for the waterfront to move in the downstream direction and to reach the downstream end of the field? For example, right now we will assume that, we will make assumption, we will take one case where we will assume that this Tt is one-fourth the time of net infiltration. That if that infiltration is one unit, it will take one-fourth the time for the advance curve to reach the downstream end. So if we make that assumption, there can be various cases. It might, it depends on the characteristics of the soil. It depends on the length of the field that, how what will be the Tt because the movement is a function of how much of the water is infiltrating with the soil as the water is moving in the forward direction and is also a function of what is the length of the field. So these are, there is only one possibility. There can be many possibilities depending on how you have fixed the other parameters. So let us make assumption that, assume, we are making assumption that Tt for the present case which you are going to consider is one-fourth the Tn. Time taken for the net irrigation depth to be achieved is four times the time taken for the advance curve to reach the downstream end. So with this assumption, we divide the total time taken which is the Tn into four different parts in such a way that delta T1, each one of these are the various intervals which we are going to consider and each one is equal to Tn by 4. So let us try to have a look what we have done so far. I will try to sketch this. That this is your total field. This is upstream end. This is upstream end. This is the upstream end. This is the upstream end. So let us try to have a look what we have done so far. So let us try to sketch this. So let us try to sketch this. So let us try to sketch this. That this is your total field. This is upstream end. This is the downstream end. Okay. I say that this is the root zone depth. Which we are interested in irrigating. So let us try to sketch that into a new position on some on your own我是 may the galoa output. You used to restate this from overtu per second to below. So we would dodge what we did tofest, determine that if we wanna look at and on the kind of konkret. So we should have to sketch this is quintessential if there are two different<|ko|> fine and this root zone depth, the total time taken you are divided in, you are trying to consider what will happen each time interval which you have considered each one is equal to one-fourth the total time requirement. So if that is the case, let us look at that what will be the depth of water infiltrated in the first time interval, the first time interval is delta T1, depth of infiltration is if I say that in general the depth of infiltration if you want to take in any one interval will be a function of what is the initial depth in the soil and what is the depth infiltrated during this time interval. So if Yi is the infiltration during that or at the end of the interval and Y0 is the infiltration which was already available in the beginning then during that interval you have the increment of the depth of infiltration is delta Yi. So similarly the depth of soil which will become wet which we will call as delta Z1 you can write because we are saying that this is our total Z, this root zone is the Z which we are considered, this is the total depth. So in the first interval this will be the depth of soil which will be wetted in the very first interval. So if we assume that Z0 to start with let us make an assumption that Z0 is 0 to start with, if it is known you can take that value but if it is not known then if it was totally dry you can always take it to be 0, not a very inappropriate assumption. So once you assume this you also need the value of alpha to be used in that equation, the Causticov equation. Let us assume that the value of alpha is also known. Because that is positive as this goes to point with minus gain which we are sorry as this is going to come right, these is zero plus these thingsJI up to be A descent. So you will measure in this example that Zotion is 0 to 1 to 2 to be a喜欢 and this isO iI. You will measure in this color side but is way-すごい and then the first interval Delta z where you become at the value of alpha is 0.5. Now that is zero plus it is 0 to 2.5 so we will be able to get it from one hour and当 one to 2 plus 루루, basically I will gweld in and this one tolich has 1. And you can use this than two values we decide in a and future of both Σ oEru phase Aujourd is 0 to 1, maybe using a linear month to 1. equal to Z2 minus sorry Z1 minus Z0 and Z1 is nothing but you have said that 0.5 minus 0 in this present case which is nothing but Z1, okay. So in this particular case if this is delta Z1, I can similarly write the expressions for other intervals or delta T2 time interval, I can find out what will be delta Z2 as Z2 minus Z1, okay. Now Z1 is nothing but this much depth, isn't it? This is Z1 is equal to delta Z1. So to find out the next depth I am trying to reduce this Z2 minus the previous depth which has been considered earlier and the previous interval. So Z2 minus Z1 which will be equal to K dash into T2 to the power 0.5 minus delta Z1 because Z1 is equal to delta Z1, okay. Now T2 is 2 times T1, okay. So this is T2 is equal to delta Z1, okay. So this is T2 is 2 times T1, okay. So if you substitute that, you will have to be equal to delta Z1, okay. So if you substitute that, your Z2 will be K dash into K dash into Z2. So this is T2 is equal to delta T1 to the power 0.5 and T2 is equal to delta Z1. So this is equal to delta Z2. So this is T2. So this is equal to delta Z1, okay. So this is equal to delta Z1, okay. So this is T2 is equal to delta Z1, okay. So if you substitute that, your Z2 will be Q dash into T1 to the power 0.5 into T2 to the power 0.5 minus delta Z1, which is nothing but delta Z1, this part is delta Z1, N2 to the power 0.5 minus 1, okay. Similarly, you can write the other forms also, delta Z3 will be delta Z1, N2 to the power 0.5 minus 2 to the power 0.5 and so on. Let's write 5 will be 5 to the power 0.5 minus 4 to the power 0.5. So this general relationship can be established. And if you plot this onto this, you will find that at the end of T is equal to 1. This will be the, this will be the general trend. If we take that, this is a linear variation. You can find that over the length of the field, this will be the variation which will be encountered because of the fact that the water is moving from the upstream end to the downstream end. And the water is taking one-fourth the time. Since the time is equal to the time to reach the downstream end, when the water will reach just the downstream end, the infiltration will be minimum there. Similarly, the other segment, the current is the same. That is what you will see in the relationship. And in each case, this will be the, the trend of the, the infiltration for each of the, the smaller segment. Example, this is for T is equal to 2, T is equal to 3, T is equal to 4. And if you go beyond this, this will be the, this will be the, the trend of the, the infiltration for each of the, the smaller segment. Example, this is for T is equal to 2, T is equal to 3, T is equal to 4. And if you go beyond this, if you go beyond this, take another segment, you will find. This is for T is equal to 5. So you have gone beyond the roots on the. Now these equations you will, if you just analyze these equations, you will find that this trend will be shown. So you will find that this trend, each successive Z or delta Z, which is lower down, will be having smaller and smaller depth. And that is quite understandable because we have been studying this so far that what happens when you go, when you have the infiltration for a longer period. So that is what is reflected here. That the initial infiltration will be at a higher rate, the later infiltration will be at a, lower rate. If you want to satisfy the downstream end of the field also, you will have to provide the waters beyond this root zone depth. That means for additional time period. Only then this component, the lower part of the field can also be satisfied. Or in other words, what you can say is that if you want to satisfy the needs of the downstream end also, you have to ensure that at least the water should be available there for Tn time. What is the net time? What is the net time for which the infiltration should take place so that to get the achieve the net irrigation requirement? Okay. So that is what you will, you can write in the form that to infiltrate depth yn into the lower end of the field, there should be opportunity time. And as that, we have to consider that TEN call on theelim correspondingly Z4 is K dash 4T1 or delta Z1 into 4 to the power 0.5 the same thing. So to achieve this the infiltration opportunity at the, in order to achieve this requirement the opportunity time at the upstream end has to be, has to be T5 which is equal to Tn plus Tn by 4 or is also equal to 5 times T1 and the corresponding Z5 is delta Z1 into 5 to the power 0.5 as we have done here the same thing, okay. Now if, that is what we have plotted here also this, this is basically the same thing which we have plotted that if you want what will happen at T is equal to 5, so that is what we have plotted already here. Now we will define two quantities which are very important quantities for our subsequent analysis and the design purpose we can utilize these. So first is that if you want to know the average depth of soil which has been wet by deep peculation, which is the same thing, what will be there at average depth of soil is basically this part, this portion which I can mark here. This is the deep peculation which could have been avoided but since we wanted to take care of the downstream areas we have indulged in this deep peculation. So this deep peculation, if you want to know that how much deep peculation you have indulged into, you can express that as delta Z5 by, that is the average deep peculation, delta 5 is linear, the maximum deep peculation, the maximum deep peculation, if we assume that this relationship is linear and is varying from delta 5 on the upstream end to the 0 level at the downstream end, then you can say the average deep peculation is delta 5 by 2 which can also be written as delta 5 minus Z4 by 2 because delta 5 is nothing but Z5 is the absolute value or the total depth up to that level and Z4 is the depth up to the root zone level at the upstream end. So let me, let me say that this is delta Z2, the next one is delta Z3, this is delta Z4 and delta Z5, okay. So this is delta Z2, these are the visual values, but for each one this is the Z1 up to this, up to the next one is Z2, Z3, Z4 and Z5. So you can, you can use it either way this is Z5 minus Z4, that is what is delta Z5 by 2 that is also, you can write. So this in fact is nothing but you can write as this in the general form minus 4 to the power 0.5 into delta Z1 by 2, okay. So this is one which gives you that what is the average deep peculation and if you want to find out the average depth of soil, which has been wet, which has been wet, then you can express that as Z4 plus Z5 by 2. So the total depth which has been wet was the average value of that is the average of the two extremes, on one side is Z5, on the side is Z4. So the average of that will give you the total depth which has been wet. and 촬영 this you can also express as so to the point 5 plus 5 to the power of, okay. Now if you take the ratio of these two quantities, the ratio of average depth of deep population to average depth of wet soil, you can write this as Z, delta Z5 by 2 by Z4 plus Z5 by 2. So this is the ratio which is 5 to the power 0.5 minus 4 to the power 0.5 by 5 to the power 0.5 plus 4 to the power 0.5 and Z, delta Z1 is cancelled out. So this is the ratio which is in this particular case is 0.056. Now in this specific case what it amounts to is you can now formulate that if the ratio of advance Tt is 1 4th the Tn is 1 4th of the Tn. So this is the ratio of the Tn to the power 0.5. So this is the ratio of the power 0.5. So this is the ratio of the power 0.5. Solia чем-uop 알았어 is the ratio of the power 0.5 direction potential вместе with tested dt is 1 fourth the Tn is 1 fourth the net infiltration time Tn and for a alpha of 0.5 the average depth of deep percolation as 5.6 percent okay this is only one instance which has been analyzed similarly there are many other instances which have been analyzed by taking different values of alpha which means that by taking different characteristics of the soil and by taking different FAR ratios which is the fractional advance ratio this ratio Tt by Tn we call it as FAR or fractional advance ratio. So if these are known then you can formulate the relationships which can be used subsequently for your analysis and I will show you some values of the table which have been provided through the similar analysis which we have done just now. This table looks like this I will just pick up some of the values out of this table so that you can get a feel of this table gives the expected percentage of deep percolation and on this side you have the fractional advance ratio FAR here you have the alpha values for different soils may be ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 for a FAR ratio of 1 or you can write it as T that is the time of opportunity is same as the time taken by the advance curve to reach the downstream end. You will have the values you can look at the order of magnitude of these values that how much if you have this parameter fixed in such a way that your advance curve or the time taken to reach for the advance curve to reach the downstream end is equal to the opportunity time requirement for the net infiltration to take place. So, if you have the time taken to reach the same time taken by the net infiltration to take place. So, if you have the net infiltration to take place, you will incur lot of losses and those losses will also vary from soil to soil. The soil is a function of alpha. So, if your alpha is increasing the deep percolation losses are also increasing. Let us take another sample of when you have T by 4 out of which we have analyzed only one but for the others for example when alpha is 0.1 and you have a FAR ratio of T by 4 and this particular case the particular case the deep percolation losses will be 1.1% and this particular case the deep percolation losses will be 1.1%, 2.2%, 3.3%, 4.5%, 5.6% that is what we have analyzed for alpha is equal to 0.5 and for FAR ratio of T by 4 or 1 by 4 and 6.7, 7.8, 0.9 and 10%. So, let us take the other extreme of T by 10 that means you are flooding the total length in very short period is where FAR ratio is T by 10. So, in this particular case your deep percolation losses will be still smaller. So, this table now can be utilized for picking up some of the parameters. You can find out that if you want to accept only the deep percolation losses of a specific range. You do not want the deep percolation losses to be more than 10% or more than 5% and you know what is the type of soil which is the prevailing type of soil. You can pick up that alpha. You can pick up that alpha and you can find out what is the most preferable FAR ratio which can be utilized and that can give you some indication towards what should be the time of irrigation should should be selected and what will be that? The time of the accordingly the time of infiltration which will be available is not dependent on only these things. It will also be dependent on then which stream size you will be picking up. What are the other parameters of the field? What is the grade? What is the grade? All those things we have not considered so far. This is only the starting, those parameters which are independent of the other aspects of the field. They are only giving you the relationship between the soil type which is through alpha and the advance time which is again dependent on the soil type to a certain extent. And all these relationships can be utilized to start your design considerations looking at which are the most suitable parameters which you should be start with, okay? So this analysis is as I had mentioned in the beginning that this is not only concerned with the furrow irrigation, it is as a general purpose analysis which can be made use of in all the surface irrigation methods. Next we will try to now start looking at the furrow irrigation method in particular. First of all we will try to look at those relationships which are obtained through experience, through field trials. So these relationships which are based on and field trials, these relationships are very important in the absence of detailed data because you can also use the hydric relationships which are more exact. But many a times you will find that the required data is not available. So you have to, you have to start at least looking at the designs with some indicators which are available. So this is a very important area all over the world. There are world organizations like a few which have compiled this information and made it available in many reports where is easily available where people have come out with under different conditions what will be the limiting design parameters from various concentrations. And we have already considered in the case of border irrigation also. The consideration, the major considerations are of the things like that the stream sizes should not be erosive, you should not create problems for your fields. Then there is one concentration, the other is that your efficiencies should be reasonable efficiencies. So that will be basically dictated by what sizes you will choose. It will be the combination of discharge, the stream size, the size of the field with respect to the soil type and with respect to the slopes, the prevailing grades. When you look at the grades, there again you have to look at are those grades excessive which can create problems of erosion. Are those grades very flat which can also create problems of drainage. So there are no specific rules and regulations which are applicable all over the places. You will have to look at the climate. You will have to look at is it a humid area, is it an arid area. The rules will be different from the similar soils but if the area is humid in one extreme and on the other extreme if the area is arid, you might have to choose different parameters. For example, let's assume that if it is a humid area. In the case of humid areas, you will have lot of rainfall occurring and that too, the intensity of the rainfall will be very high. If you go in for slopes which are steep slopes, maybe that during the irrigation time you can control those stream sizes, you can control the rate of application of water. But what will happen when the rain will occur? There would not be any control. There would not be any control. At that time, the slopes which are prevailing in the fields, they will remain there. So when the rain water will be generated, the surface runoff will be generated, that will create havoc. They will create lot of erosion and all your fields might be distorted. It might be devoid of all the fertile land which was there. It might damage the crop altogether. So all those things are possible. So when you look at those recommended parameters, you will have to take into consideration many other conditions which are beyond the irrigation conditions. These things are very important and we will look at all these relationships which have been formulated on the basis of the experience of the farmer. Whereas farmer might not be having the scientific explanations of all these practices which he has been indulging into. But through the experience, through the common sense, he has arrived at some of the combinations which are very scientific, which are very realistic. And those things have also been taken into consideration when the various researchers have looked into all these various possible details of these parameters. They have taken into consideration all those experiences of the local farmers and those have also been brought out in all those publications wherever possible. Along with that, the other recommendations are based on the experimentation which for example, in the case of border regression we had seen that how we can do the evaluation runs. So through those evaluation runs, you keep on taking the observations and then you analyze those data and come out with the recommended procedures. For example, in the case of the evaluation, you run those stream sizes and the fields and see that how much erosion is taking place. You find out which are the stream sizes, which are limiting stream sizes beyond which if you increase the stream size for those specific type of soils under those slopes, you will have the erosion problem. So that is how you collect the data and you make the recommendations. So all those things we will discuss in the next class and along with that we will also look at the hydraulic relationships which have been formulated on the basis of the hydraulic principles. So all those things we will discuss in the next class and they can be used for the design wherever those data, the required data are available. Okay. Any question at this stage? Thank you then. Thank you.
