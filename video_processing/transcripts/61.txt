 Music Okay, today we're going to plant some corn. We're using a horse drawn 999L corn planter. And the method we're going to use is called check row planting. We're going to check our corn, which means that we have our planter set at 36 inch rows. And we'll be using a check wire, which is this here, we'll explain a little bit later. And every 36 inches, it'll drop anywhere from two to four kernels depending on how we set it. So we'll have hills of corn every 36 inches. And when we're done with this planting, this entire field will be on a 36 inch grid. And it's an old method of the way they used to plant corn before they had sprays and stuff for weeds. We'll have, you'll be able to cultivate the corn the way you've rose, the way we planted it. You'll be able to turn 90 degrees and elevate your corn crossways because your rose will be, everything is on 36 inch. And that'll help. You'll just have a little column of weeds left around the four plants. Okay. So the way we achieve this is they've got a wire. We're going to roll the wire out first. That's the first thing you do. We're not going to plant any corn. And every, every 36 inches, there is a knot on this wire. And the wire runs on the planter. And it'll trip the plant, the seed boxes with four kernels every 36 inches. And we'll, we'll show you how that's going to work, how that works. But first you have to anchor it. You've got to have an anchor for your wire. And we laid out a straight line. You want one line on your edge of your field to be straight. So everything, as you advance across the field, everything is in line. So they've got some stakes and you press them into the ground to anchor your wire. And then we'll take off and unroll the wire to the other end of the field. I'm not sure, but I think most of these spools had about a quarter mile of wire on them. And when we get to the other end of the field, the roll will unhook from there. We'll leave it on that end of the field with another anchor and come back. And then we'll hook onto the wire onto the planter and start the process of planting some corn. Today we're going to use a jaw-and-deer tractor to pull the planter. The planter originally was made for horses, as you can see. It's not a way for the double tree. But you can keep the rows much straighter with the tractor. And when the wire is running alongside, the wire runs right alongside of the horses when they're walking. And it's jumping up and down and moving all around. And if the horses aren't used to it, they could get a little excited. They think it's a great big snake coming after them. So we are going to use the tractor today. We're going to remove the roll of wire. Take it off. Bring the remaining valve. Set it all the way up here against the rod of the way. Cut it away. We'll have to move the wire real with the stake. Each time we move the stake, we'll have to move the wire. Now here's the other anchor stake. Grab one. About right here there's a little hook on this stake. Once you grab that wire and then you pull it tight, I'll go back one more. Hold it, push it. Push it into the ground. Get a good anchor. And that's it. We'll just go back to the other end of the field and hook the wire up to the planter and start planting. Okay, we're back down at the end of the field getting ready to start. We'll hook up the wire first. We have a little trip mechanism here. You grab your check wire and you bring it up here. And there's a little deal here that this is what catches the knots as you go. You get it up on top of these rollers. And then you bring it up. And it latches in here. And runs through these roller guides, the wire. And every time it gets to a knot, it'll trip this lever right there. And it'll drop four kernels of corn and make a hill. So that's how it works. As you go along, it'll click, click. It'll be tripping. Next thing you need to do is set your roll markers. So you can see that way to follow on the way back. Make the groove in there and I'll put the center of the tractor tire right on that groove as we come back. And you should have nice straight rows. The other thing we got to do is lower the shoes down into the ground. And now it'll be engaged in gear and start the plant. All right. We made it to the end of the field. Now, there's a little release right there. We'll step on that with the foot. That'll release the wire. The wire will fall off. Usually falls off on its own. We'll turn around and reset to go back. And then we have to move the wire stake over. We'll show you how that is as soon as I get turned around. Okay, we're turned around. And now we have to reset our anchor on this end. And that's when you, every time you get to the end, you got to move your wire over. When we get down to the other end, we'll have to do the same identical thing. We'll move it over. Pull up the stake. Pull the wire caught. Pull it over. And line up with the center of your tractor or the seat on your planter. And then re-push it into the ground. Okay, and you pick up your wire. Put it in the little, the little tripping mechanism there. Lower your planter down into the planting position. And you're good to go. Okay, we're back down to the end of the field again, where we started at. So now we have to move our wire over again. And we're going to move our wire over again. All right, we got the field all planted. We're all done. Now the next thing to do is to roll the wire back up. What you do is take and start your roll, get it, roll the access up to the back of the machine. You got to drive over the top of the wire all the way back. Put it underneath. Set it up in there. Like that. Okay. And then we got a little clutch assembly here. Friction. We'll tighten that up a little bit. And then we have a dog here on this gear that we flip up to engage it. Now we should be able to just drive along. And it'll, oh wait, we got a, there should be a, a little coat. A little cone affair right here. With the wire in. Take it out of gear. Take it out of gear. I can't. I can't. Got a little bit underneath the tractor. We need to wind up yet. Do that by hand, by turning it by hand. And we're glad we don't have to do the whole field like this. Okay. There it is. We're all done. Ready to head to the next field. We got this field of Minnesota 13 all planted. We'll later on when it comes up, show you what it looks like and how to cultivate it. We'll, you know, We'll get this field of Minnesota 13 all planted. We'll, you know, Later on when it comes up, show you how, what it looks like and how to cultivate it. We'll, you know, How to cultivate it. We'll, you know, How to cultivate it. That has I know a place where it comes. Water cannot be with a high park.
