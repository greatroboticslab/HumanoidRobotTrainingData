Education
 I joined the 161 project just for more information as far as in what else or other options to do and to try something different from being doing the same thing for 20 odd years with my father. I've just seen an opportunity to get someone else's opinion and have a different perspective on growing cane. Working with Shane has been a really good experience. Shane has been really open to the recommendations and he's been keen to understand why we're doing what we're doing and he's grasped the concepts really well. The main specific change that we've made by being in the project is dropping nitrogen levels. So far it's been really good. We haven't had any problems that we've conceived by dropping nitrogen rates. Quite happy looking forward to what's going on, especially from a financial point of view as well as anything else. We went through what soil samples he had and we put together a nutrient program based on just matching up with the soils and the nutrients. The nutrient management plan is what we decide on what fertiliser goes on all our crops now. We 100% follow what's been recommended. It's very easy to follow. Doesn't require us to look any further into because all the rates and everything John's already put down for us. So yeah, there's no further research needed. It's all available for us right there and then on the one sheet of paper. The success of RP161 is really around being able to tailor the recommendations and present them back to the growers so that any doubts about what they're trying to do is being removed. So they can understand that the recommendations are suited, best practice for their particular farm and then they're quite happy to move forward and put them into place. Working with John and using the nutrient management plan is just a reassurance from someone else's opinion and he's been very straightforward and easy to understand what he's trying to accomplish and the reasons for doing what we plan on doing. So far what I've learned from being in the project that you don't need as large amount of nitrogen as we once had thought and after the first year we've had the best crop we've had in a fair few years. This project I'd highly recommend to other people that are willing to try and get out there and just for the trial part because yeah, well I've seen no repercussions of trying it and the bottom line is it's saved us money so far. So that it's 400 years Cечь was so far. So you can find this method, living with us, is it close to the next year?
