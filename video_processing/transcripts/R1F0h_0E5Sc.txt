 Music My name is Bill Ringland. I'm an operational member of AgriGrain. AgriGrain is a family run business that's been in operation for over 30 years now. We're based in Narromine but have recently opened a receival site in Canebel. A few things. It's obviously a huge drawing area for grain in New South Wales. A huge opportunity for us to take the next step as a business and also service an area that had been crying out for someone else to step into the area. Another strong advantage to the area and us being here is the diversity in the soil types. From Walgut through to the Largenbone there's some varying ranges of soil type, black soil type, red soil type, which obviously accommodate different crop types. So that gives us a commodity diversity, I suppose, which is important for us as a business. We've just had a Western Australian based company take a major shareholding in our business. So Plum Grove coming into a shareholding in AgriGrain means that we have an additional capital expenditure to be able to spend on facilities like the one in Canebel to try and service the grower a bit better. The train that's coming today is heading into Port Botany. From there it will go to multiple destinations all around the world. A lot into South East Asia, China and some chickpeas into India. We're heading into our third harvest since being in Canebel and a big positive for us is the way that the local growers have embraced us being here. We're here for the long term and look to become a part of the community. From a tonnage point of view, historically the Canebel and Walgut area has been upwards of three or four hundred thousand tons of wheat. And on top of that there's obviously chickpeas and barley and canola as well, depending on what rotations people are running. So it's a huge opportunity and a huge capture area for us. It's potentially almost a $20 a tonne freight advantage having someone like us here for them. Especially with the pulses, instead of going to somewhere like Narrabri or Dubbo, they've got the option to come here and we're essentially a step forward in their supply chain, which is a huge advantage for them I think. In essence we're a storage and export facility, so during harvest a grower has the opportunity to either warehouse grain with us, we can purchase it off them directly or we'll do contracts with them for a forward sale. Our capacity for storage is around a hundred thousand tonnes and with Plumgrove coming on board we're looking to, through a number of stages, expand that to hopefully around two hundred thousand tonnes in the next 18 or 24 months.
