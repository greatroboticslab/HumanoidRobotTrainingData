 Hi, I'm Doug Barrett from the Ellenwood LDI store and I'm here to talk today on the proper ballasting of the tractor and the proper air inflation of the tires. What we have, we're wanting to maintain a 2 to 4% slip when setting up our tractor for the proper demo. So to do that, we've got to go in and we've got to get our air pressure set properly from tire to tire. And also on the back, the proper inflation will basically put 3 bars on the ground, solid on the ground. That will be what you look for and then you can adjust from that by whatever piece of equipment that you've got on the back of the tractor. The other thing that we'll have will be proper ballasting, which is going to be our weight issues. We're going to have weights on the inside of our duals and we can set different weights for that. Plus, we'll have weights on the front of the tractor and we can do that.
