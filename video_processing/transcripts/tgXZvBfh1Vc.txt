Let's get started. nice profit in your production okay so the materials here are the things that you are going to use these are all available from today when you go back you have to plant aloe vera red pepper you have to plant red pepper right now you are producing onions okay if the onion the real valve is not there you can use the leaves okay volume beams can also work well because of its pangal smell this is the first some of the best concerning it uh mean three you have to come in three sometimes you wonder why people plant flowers around the compound there are some flowers people ask something to beautify the home to make your compound look beautiful but today is not only making your comfort to look beautiful it will make your garden to look beautiful because when the garden is having having pests all over you saw from our cabbage the cabbage is very happy it has a perforated leaf the leaves are okay the plant looks very happy okay but we want to make our garden beautiful using that beautiful flowers okay so i'm very happy today because we are learning about how to make organic pesticides for example i have aloe vera here in my hand it is used it acts as a fertilizer because it has ingredients like magnesium potassium and many others it is also it helps control of pesticides and many other pesticides caterpillars beetles and many others this is red pepper or pili pili one of the materials used in making our organic pesticides in this in this pili pili it is when we are using in five liters of water we pick one cup of pili pili we pound it and we put it in our container we really contain the active ingredients which helps in controlling aphids caterpillars ants and also beetons and it's called marigold when you're using it you get like five cups of the leaves you pound it after pounding you put it in your container the marigold the marigold the active ingredient that works on our pests like the the caterpillars and the cat worms so they are actually used in controlling those pests in our crops in our crops we have having in my hand is one of the materials among them and here i'm having nim nim it works in things like control of fungal diseases bananas swivels today i'm very very happy because we are learning about how to make organic pesticides in the hand here i have tomato leaves when you pound it then mix it with other substances that is used in making organic pesticides and it helps some it brings some irritation in insects and definitely it kills the insect life it helps in controlling pests like cat worms caterpillars and the rest of it so we have many pests that the street our crop so this one would help a lot may enjoy i'm very very proud to be here in a little training institute here is our one of our materials for making organic pesticides this is onion balm if you want to make it you can use this one something like seven of them and in absence of that one you can use the leaf something like half of a kilo and each onion tab you can take it to the mutter and then you pound it and from there this one it acts as a repellent also it is it controls what is so called ant both red ant and then and then black ant not only that one one it can also control it can also control only one and then office and then cut one also so that is all about the onion thank you okay thank you very much in case of one of the materials maybe you don't have the aloe vera but you have the you have the like the red pepper the red pepper can also work on a piece aloe vera can also work on a piece so in the absence of aloe vera you can use the water the red pepper in the absence of the red pepper you can use the water then even those ones in the absence of the tomatose leaf you can use the water the saline or tamaric we're going to pound it after pound it we water them when we keep in this container for for three days after three days after three days we're going to see the solution and we use it for again for spraying our top seed again again it's fast like caterpillar the ants and many others this is how you are going to pound it if you cannot pound like this you can chop them chop them into small pieces how you chop a green vegetable when you are preparing it getting where the body so you make sure that the leaves are broken to leave those inner content to be able to release their substance into the water okay so if you have water you can pound like this now we add this one it's already five five handful of the tomato leaves okay we are also going to add it here okay uh-huh you add it here and then we pound what let us pound aloe vera aloe vera we can even you can mix all this material all together and you pound at one if you have a bigger mortar i get to that so you can put this aloe vera and you can mix all this material all together and you can mix all the leaves and then you can mix all the leaves and cut all the leaves and cut the onions. so you cut the onions and also pound all together. the onion leaves okay so why are we using onions? it's a repellent and it also controls our feeds okay then we are going to put we are going to also pound together one cup of red pepper okay you pound carefully you have to be careful otherwise so remaining two onions now the process the process of mixing all these things together and then put add water into it is to allow what is called decoction decoction it means you have taken tea all right the tea leaves is dry but when you put in water after after sometimes you find the color of that water has changed okay it means the solute the materials the component of the tea leaves has gotten into the water and changed the color are you getting that so the active ingredient in these materials will get into the water the process of this material this active ingredient getting into the water is called decoction okay so the process of for us to get what we need to control first those active ingredients we must keep it in water for three days okay so we are going to keep it we are going to stand it in water for three days after three days we shall sieve this material and then we get only the solution down there okay that solution has all the active ingredients which will kill different kind of pests so long as we apply onto the on them okay so it will give us a contact now you can see this is a mixture of onions red pepper and aloe vera okay now you have to take care you have to so you pour it here good then now you can put some water there you rinse pour water in the mortar and then you also add it here so i think this one doesn't doesn't deserve only five liters this material is too much let us prepare a solution of 10 liter out of this okay a solution of 10 liter so the the only challenge with the organic materials we do not know exactly what quantity of any active ingredients present in that solution okay that is the problem because we cannot determine we don't have the machine to determine to detect the amount of uh decoction or concoction so you can see now we have put all the material together inside the container okay it is even starting to irritate i am hearing people are coughing it means now our pesticide has started working it is starting to irritate your throat and some of you will start shedding tears okay so now this material is not is more than for five liter okay let us add here 10 liter of water it is very concentrated okay okay i told you that this is a serious organic pesticide okay i can see people are now coughing it means it means the the pesticide has started working it is so irritating it is so irritating such that when you add on to it is so it is very much of this thing that you do when you apply on to the pest the pest will never survive okay have you measured water so we are preparing a solution of 10 liter okay a 10 liter solution of organic pesticide you can pour and put it up here let's let's get up let's make money come together okay you form a cow from a cow baby whatever so we have reached the final steps the final step of preparing our organic pesticide okay so
