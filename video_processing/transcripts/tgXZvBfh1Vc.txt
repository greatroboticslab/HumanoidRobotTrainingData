Let's get started. Let's go took started. Let's do it. Let's get started. Let's go to the profit to plant aloe vera red pepper you have to plant red pepper right now you are producing onions okay if the onion the real valve is not there you can use the leaves okay onion leaves can also work well because of its pangale smell this is the first some of the best consuming it uh mince tree you have to plant mince tree sometimes you wonder why people plant flowers around the compound there are some flowers for us something to beautify the home to make your compound look beautiful but today you don't only make your comfort to look beautiful it will make your garden to look beautiful because when the garden is having having pests all over you saw from our cabbage the cabbage is very happy it has a perforated leaf the leaves are okay the plant looks very happy okay but we want to make our garden beautiful using that beautiful flowers okay i'm very happy today because we are learning about how to make organic pesticides for example i have aloe vera here in my hand it is used it acts as a fertilizer because it has ingredients like magnesium potassium and many others it also it helps you control the pesticides and many other pesticides caterpillars beetles and many others this is red pepper or pili pili one of the materials used in making our organic pesticides in this in this pili pili it is when we are using in five liters of water we pick one cup of pili pili we pound it and we put it in our container we really contains the active ingredients which helps in controlling our feeds caterpillars and also beetles and it is called marigold when you're using it you get like five cups of the leaves and you pound it after pounding you put it in your container the marigold are the active ingredient that works on our pests like the caterpillars and the cat worms so they are actually used in controlling those uh pests in our crops i'm having my hand is one of the materials among them and here i'm having neem leaf it works in things like control of fungal diseases bananas weevils today i'm very very happy because we are learning about how to make organic pesticides in the hand here i have tomato leaves when you pound it then mix it with other substances that is used in making organic pesticides and it helps us um some it brings some irritation in insects and definitely it kills the insect life it helps in controlling pests like catworm caterpillars and the rest of it so we have many pests that destroy our crop so this one would help a lot make it to be a little training institute here is our one of our material for making organic pesticides this is onion ball if you want to make it you can use this one something like seven of them and in absence of that one you can use the leaf something like half of a kilo and this onion you can take it to the mud and then you pound it and from there this one it acts as a repellent also it is it controls what is so called and both red and and then and then black and not only that one it can also control it can also control armyworm and then office and then catworm also so that is all about the onion thank you one of the materials okay thank you very much in case of one of the materials maybe you don't have the aloe vera but you have the you have the like the red pepper the red pepper can also work on a piece aloe vera can also work on a piece so in the absence of aloe vera you can use the word that is the red pepper in the absence of the red pepper you can use the word that is the one then even those ones in the absence of the tomato leaf you can use the word that is the name or tamaric we're going to pound it after pound it we water them when we keep in this container for three days after three days we're going to see the solution and we use it for again for spraying our crop seed again again it's first like after caterpillar the ants and many others this is how you are going to pound it if you cannot pound like this you can chop them chop them into small pieces how you chop a green vegetable when you are preparing it getting where okay the body so you make sure that the leaves are broken to leave those inner content to be able to release their substance into the water okay so if you have water you can pound like this now we add this one is already five five handful of the tomato leaves okay we are also going to add it here okay you add it here and then we pound what let us pound aloe vera aloe vera we can even you can mix all this material all together and you pound at one if you have a bigger mortar i get to that so you can put this aloe vera a roller we cut the onions so you cut the onions we also found all together the onion leaves okay so why are we using onions is a repellent and it also controls our feeds okay then we are going to put we are going to also pound together one cup of red pepper okay you pound carefully you have to be careful otherwise so remaining two onions now the process the process of mixing all these things together and then put hot water into it is to allow what is called decoction decoction it means you have taken tea all right the tea leaves is dry but when you put in water after sometimes you find the color of that water has changed okay it means the solute the materials the component of the tea leaves has gotten into the water and change the color are you getting that so the active ingredient in these materials will get into the water the process of this material this in active ingredient getting into the water is called decoction okay so the process of for us to get what we need to control first those active ingredients we must keep it in water for three three days okay so we are going to keep it we are going to stand it in water for three days after three days we shall see this material and then we get only the solution down there okay that solution has all the active ingredient which will kill different kind of pests so long as we apply onto the onto them okay so it will give us a contact pesticide now you can see this is a mixture of onions red pepper and uh the aloe vera okay now you have to take care you have to so you pour it here good then now you can put some water there you rinse pour water in the mortar and then you also add it here okay so i think this one doesn't doesn't deserve only five liters this material is too much let us prepare a solution of 10 liter out of this okay a solution of 10 liter so the the only challenge with the organic materials we do not know exactly what quantity of any active ingredient present in that solution okay that is the problem because we cannot be coming we don't have the machine to determine to detect the amount of so why we cannot go let's News verdi sick different types of to deposition is too much so we have to do that by GM Daniel Rosen Joshua so we can also share courier I'm sure everything comes back So you can see now we have put all the material together inside the container, okay? It is even starting to irritate. I am hearing people are coughing. It means now our pesticide started working. It is starting to irritate your throat and some of you will start shedding tears, okay? So now this material is not is more than for five liters, okay? Let us add here 10 liters of water. It is very concentrated, okay? I told you that this is a serious organic pesticide, okay? I can see people are now coughing. It means... It means the pesticide has started working. It is so irritating. It is so irritating such that when you add onto, when you apply onto the pest, the pest will never survive, okay? Have you measured water? So we are preparing a solution of 10 liters, okay? A 10 liter solution of organic pesticide you can pour. This one is just another thing? add��spl fim GrüDIA Add gerne Let's get up. Come together. Okay, you form a curve. So we have reached the final steps. The final step of preparing our organic pesticide, okay? Yes. Okay.
