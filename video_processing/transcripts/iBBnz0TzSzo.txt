 was there a lot more crops you were growing back then or is it pretty steady state from that period of time? Yeah, that's a good question. We actually used to grow more before the pandemic, but because of the pandemic, we had to kind of slim down and do what were basically our best sellers. And then after that, we've slowly integrated seasonal holiday items here and there. But yeah, we used to grow kind of like smaller, kind of like we grew like celery and we had the individual types of radish versus radish mix, you know? So like we used to be a little bit more varied, but I think it's beneficial to us now because now we can just grow and be really sustainable and like really consistent, you know, with what we do.
