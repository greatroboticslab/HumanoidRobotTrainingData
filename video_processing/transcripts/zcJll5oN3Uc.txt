 It's finding a better way to live. Coming over to help you guys. It's finding a better way to live. Coming over to help you guys with the garden. So this place as you can see is a pretty big castle. But we're only a small part of that. So we're just starting our permaculture project here at this castle of Fougeret. Permaculture is a way that tries to work with nature instead of working against it. So it's a lot of observing nature and then trying to interfere only in the slightest ways. We're digging trenches for our polytunnel. So that next year we can have a lot of tomatoes and aubergines. So what we're going to do the next days is to put the plastic foil on top of this metal frame. And then the corners will be dug in on the sides to make it nice and stable. And for this we need trenches. This multifunctional tool also doubles as a back scratcher. So good! I've coordinated the gardens in Ecolony for three and a half years. Yeah, we met each other in Ecolony five years ago. And that's where I first got into touch with gardening. And my passion are medicinal plants. The last years we were basically just like you guys traveling in our bus. I went to visit this place with Sina. And after some long discussions we decided to come here to set up the gardens. And after the days of the grave, all these beds and the trees there, it's time to put plants in the earth. But they're still so small and small. It's a bit exciting with this warm sun. But I think it's a really nice idea if you're going to sing a hard warm song for them on the field. That's how they do it! And the garden has a whoop! The river is flowing, flowing and growing. Grow beautiful plants, grow! It's about two months ago that Hilda and Oscar left us. And we just wanted to show you how our garden looks after two months. And the tunnel that we built together with them. I just got a castle that is a Dracula castle and I still live! I killed Dracula! The castle is called Fougeret. Fou means crazy. And it's already in the name Fougeret somehow. So it's a crazy castle. First it was not really a castle. It was like a hunting house. And then the previous owner added. Added some castle-like features. Yeah, exactly. The castle is just a meeting point. Like that's how I feel it nowadays. It's just a meeting point for a lot of people. For the first time in my life I'm preparing a bed for sewing. So we're sewing. So we're sewing. This is a sewing machine. This is a sewing machine. It's a sewing machine. The wool goes into this pocket. And a sew machine is kept to the lift side. And itcemos with the albo sword in a hole here. And then it's stuck here on the wall. And it youngs. We eventually also want to teach courses and host people, have a little cafe and experiment with new methods of gardening. We are going to plant nitrogen fixing plants like trees and shrubs, lower bushes. And the idea is that those enrich the soil. I love working with the ground, working with the soil, working with my hands also. It just really grounds me and makes me feel more connected. The idea is that there is in the future will be a more permanent group here. And that's really what I like. Just to live with a group of people that you can inspire each other. Everybody has his own qualities. It's just wonderful if you can share those qualities with each other. So if you enjoyed this medium... Then press like. If you really like it, press two times like. And then share it with everyone you know and don't know. And type some comments. Do it now. And is there a donate button somewhere? Yeah? Oh there's a donate button! Guys! You know what? Do it, eh? Press. You basically did our outro for us. And it's now time to say bye bye to all you folks! And see you next time! Bye bye! Bye bye! Adios! Adios!
