The biggest thing with our return on assets is we had a lot of inventory turnover, which as anybody knows, inventory turnover really helps with your return on assets because you're able to keep that moving. And that's part of the reason that it was as high as it was, we had a very good year both monetary and unit typically. And moving the units really helped because we have a large inventory for the most part keeping somewhere around 150 units, used units on the ground at any point in time. And so we like to look at it as if we can keep that moving, we're going to be more profitable in the end, which that's what the return on assets definitely show. And by moving all that all the time, it makes us feel, if nothing else, better about ourselves from making a few sales here and there too.
