 Music Traditionally, pumpkins are one of our favorite fall crops. Pumpkins are also a crop that can encourage kids to start to like gardening. But one thing to keep in mind when growing pumpkins is that here in Wyoming we have a short growing season. So think about starting your pumpkin seeds inside just to get a jump on so that you can have a nice pumpkin patch towards the end of fall. There are too many varieties of pumpkins to name here now but know that there are white, orange, striped and even giant pumpkins that can grow well over 500 pounds that all grow well here in Wyoming. As you can see here, pumpkins take up a lot of space so keep in mind when planning out your garden space where you want to have your pumpkins at. Beyond just making jack-o-lanterns, you can also grow pumpkins to eat as well. If you're looking for any more information on pumpkins, contact your local Extension office.
