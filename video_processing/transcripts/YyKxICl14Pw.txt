 In this particular pond, we have another incredible function happening here in the food forest, which is that by turning a simple valve, I can actually flood irrigate systems in this food forest that will water trees and plants with this fertile pond water full of beneficial microorganisms, bacteria, nutrients from the fish, from detritus, which is decomposing plant matter that falls to the bottom of the pond water and gets munched by all the microorganisms. So you have this alive water. We're actually fertilizing the entire food forest at the same time that we're irrigating it.
