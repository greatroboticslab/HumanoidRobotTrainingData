 We started, if you read the literature, everybody knew that no-till had more runoff than conventional tillage. But no-till at that time was they'd take a conventionally tilled field after harvest, they'd till some of it, leave some of it untilled and sprinkle it with water and gee, water went ran off more in the no-till, see. And so we actually included a no-till type treatment in some of what we're doing as kind of a high runoff check. But after three years, it wasn't the high runoff check anymore. But then to try to get people to move that way in the system took a while. And then kind of that started to change the mindset.
