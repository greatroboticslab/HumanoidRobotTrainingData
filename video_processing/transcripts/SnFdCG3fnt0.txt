 When we're going out and we're moving cattle from one pasture to the next, you can just see how it benefits both the grass and the cattle. How much better nutritionally we can offer different grasses to our cattle by letting that grass rest. As you see, the cattle get excited. They want to come, they want to net new grass. You can see a very big difference in some of the more continual graze systems versus our rotations in your extended grass, in the health of your cattle, in the wildlife, in all of it.
