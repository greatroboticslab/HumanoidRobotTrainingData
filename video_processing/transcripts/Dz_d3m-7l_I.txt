 I started this five degree day by checking on the chickens. No one was in the run so I checked the coop. Even at this temp they're laying us eggs. Today I'm an ice farmer so we're lugging water in five gallon buckets. Breaking ice out of buckets feels like my new hobby. The pigs are staying nice and warm in their huts and the cows in the barn. Back to breaking the ice.
