 This week at the moment we've been putting in the very earliest of our pansies and as well as our ranunculus and then through into June and we'll finish off with our bulbs. There's no real way of avoiding the bending. There's plenty of time spent on the hands and knees during this time of the year but we do have a few tools that we use to to alleviate some of that. We stagger our planting dates through the nursery one to assist with them and their bench space and allow us to plant throughout a period of about eight to ten weeks. The one we're currently planting there's about 450 pansies that have gone into the border and approximately 250 ranunculus in the middle. But in Queen's Park Gardens here we'll be looking in the vicinity of 35 to 40 000 seedlings and approximately five to six thousand bulbs. It is a lot of work but well worth it.
