 question of the day is it worth paying a big premium sometimes thousands and thousands of dollars to get the John Deere green or Kubota orange paint well I've got my own opinion on that if it's worth it or not but I'm going to be as objective as possible give you some information some food for thought to help you make your own decision behind me here we have a big Kubota tractor we've got a John Deere cab tractor and an LS tractor all right so John Deere and Kubota are kind of what my channel is known for I do have a preference to deal with those and I'll get into that the reasons why however we recently made a video made a pretty strong case for the LS tractors or New Holland and so this LS tractor is representative of all the value brands out there and in my mind value brands are LS or New Holland you have Mahindra you have Massey you have Coyote you have some others as well that kind of come and go but there's also trade-offs that come along with those value prices and so let's work through that today see if the extra cost for some of these bigger more popular brands is it all just marketing or are you getting more bang for your buck so there's quite a few reasons why I've historically chosen to carry pretty much exclusively John Deere and Kubota tractors so I buy and sell used tractors I sell brand new attachments that go along with any tractor that's out there virtually but as far as the tractors go I'm not affiliated with John Deere not affiliated with Kubota but there's a lot of reasons I sell just those two brands for the most part and so for me for my customer base you know I sell equipment nationwide and so I have a very large audience and a very large following a very large potential customer base and for me I talked about it in the LS video too but if we want to first talk about the amount of dealers that are out there to get your service done on your tractor to have repairs done to have parts available if you want to do things yourself well we talked about how there's six times as many John Deere dealers spread around the U.S. compared to the amount of LS dealers or there's double the amount of Kubota dealers compared to the amount of LS dealers so that means there's that many more opportunities for folks you know that are in larger maybe not metropolitan areas but larger farming communities or just different locations to potentially have a Kubota dealer or a John Deere dealer versus an LS dealer so for me as a reseller of used machinery I want to make sure that there's a higher chance or a higher probability for my customers to be located near one of those dealers and I can do that or I can increase that chance by selling John Deere and Kubota and what I mean by that is I am looking to make sure that my customer is set up for success right if there's no dealer that's within 100 or 200 miles then that's unless they're really handy which a lot of guys are moving out buying a homestead buying 5-10 acres kind of getting away from the city a lot of you guys are first-time tractor owners you know you don't want to be wrenching on your equipment you don't know how to wrench on your equipment you want to pay somebody else to do that and that's perfectly fine John Deere and Kubota have a lot of great mechanics that's why they're there so that's point number one I'm making a difference between the big two brands and something like LS or Mahindra or somebody else is that proximity to your dealer to your service to your parts all right if we talk about just features that are found on these tractors in general so within the John Deere and Kubota lineups they are going to have so many different series and models that you're going to find premium additions you're going to find value additions so you're going to have a wide spectrum across the board so if you are looking at some of those value series they may or may not compare with something like an LS or Mahindra when we did our comparison recently with the LS over here this is a 40 horsepower tractor I was comparing that against a John Deere 3039R which is a premium John Deere model it was on on paper that was the closest matchup some guys commented that they thought it should have been matched up with the John Deere 3e series but I don't think that that was a very fair comparison on paper again the specs were not even close with a 3e series that is meant to be a very stripped down value oriented tractor that is almost on par with more of a 2 series than a 3 series and I could be wrong but it seemed like a lot of those guys that were trying to compare the LS to the 3e series were kind of biased towards the LS now all that said some of the things that I have found historically on some of the value brands that you want to look out for the biggest one being a quick attach bucket like two levers a skid steer quick attach bucket to release your bucket be able to put on pallet forks a grapple a snow pusher some other attachment to open up the versatility of your front end loader I send out quotes every day every single day for folks that have these value tractors that either have some goofy very custom quick attach mount for that specific brand or they have a pinned on bucket and want to convert that to a quick attach bucket you're wasting money by paying that upcharge to go and convert to a quick attach bucket so you want to look for that if you're buying new request that ssqa or skid steer quick attach right up front but as far as what's going on underneath the hood the chassis a lot of those main components with the engines those are all made from manufacturers that build tens of thousands of tractors and other pieces of machinery a year these are well proven engines and transmissions for the most part yes there are going to be trade-offs in engineering you're going to see maybe electrical issues are a good example on some of the value brands start to crop up more and and become problematic although it still seems like it's a sporadic issue there's certain models or maybe certain generations you can find those models just by doing a little bit of research just open up a tab on google type in whatever the making model is and click the word problems you're going to see you're going to have those identified and you know what models to avoid at that point but the flip side again is even with John Deere and Kubota I've lost track of how many times whether it's been under warranty or not that I have taken equipment in to have repairs done because even the best engineering in the world is not foolproof but potentially it lowers the probability of those unexpected repairs occurring but touching back on our first point if you have a dealer at least somewhat nearby that's going to soften the blow a little bit now when we compared that John Deere 30 39R to this LS model right here there was a significant difference you know this loader on the LS lifted a lot more weight I think it was six or seven hundred pounds more than the comparable John Deere but the difference was just the same on the back end with the John Deere lifting a lot more on the three point compared to the LS but you got to look at things closely as well so I know that this loader did not lift nearly as high I think it was eight inches lower of a maximum height if you're not lifting it as high you should be able to lift more but I'd encourage you to check out a place like tractor data they're going to have maybe not every tractor model on there but many of them you know it's a good place to reference to get those lift capacities to get the weight of the tractor the length of the tractor the height of the drops you know the three point lift capacity the three point category size all that information so you can kind of make a as close of an apples to apples comparison these manufacturers are pretty good at not allowing you to have a true apples to apples comparison and a head-to-head match you know and that could be within the John Deere and Kubota lineup itself or if you're comparing one of them to another they're just all over the map they're always trying to fill a little gap in the market and so there's going to be certain features found on some tractors that are not on others and vice versa and you're going to have to prioritize what's most important to you based on your needs and your wants and let that kind of guide you to the right selection the point being is that just because you're getting a value tractor doesn't necessarily mean you're losing all sorts of features or capacity or capability there could be some trade-offs here and there I know this model does not have a suspension seat an air ride seat I'm told that the newer generation does have that option maybe this one does I don't know but for the savings getting a tractor like this versus a John Deere 30 39 hour where you could pay 12 15 thousand dollars less look at that video in the comment section there were some guys saying that they just couldn't justify it there were differences as high as 20 grand in a comparable model in an LS versus a John Deere now so we talk about reliability and you want your tractor to last a long time right so a lot of us buy our machine thinking that this is going to be the one that you know that the kids sell off after we're gone but I'm in business because that's not the case most of the time so a lot of guys are are buying a tractor and using it for a certain set of projects and selling it off or they're buying it realizing they want a cab tractor not an open station or realizing they bought too small or they have to downsize or whatever it is there's a lot of reasons that you may sell your tractor and so most of us guys here are are not going to put more than 50 to 100 hours on average a year on our equipment and I know there's some of you out there that put a lot more on there I mean we've got a buddy just down the street I'm talking about you Eric Perry yeah he put oh I don't know like 300 and some hours or something like that on his tractor in the last year he's just been working the heck out of it and having a lot of fun you may have seen in some previous videos we did with a bomb light stump grinder at his house and everything else but most of us that's the exception to the rule let me put it that way most of us are kind of in that 50 to 100 hour a year range while these tractors are typically going to last maybe five to fifteen thousand hours before that engine wears out and has to be rebuilt just depending on how it's maintained what kind of environment it's used in and maybe a little bit of luck too but this really isn't commercial equipment so to speak this is being used on farms and on homesteads and on the weekends and after work just to knock out projects and part of the reason those hours I think stay so low is because they're so efficient they're so good at doing their job where a job that you may have thought by hand or with a wheelbarrow or the the UTV and a trailer was going to take you all day could end up taking you just two hours with a tractor to do it all right so I want to talk about a really important topic which is going to be depreciation slash resale value if you do end up selling it down the road up until the last 18 well up until the pandemic started I should say it was a completely different market than what we have today and oftentimes I would have folks that wanted to trade in an LS or a Mahindra or Massey or or something else and you know they were shocked by how little I would give them for that tractor but I came to those decisions those values that I would offer for this equipment based on what I had seen when I had outright purchased a coyote or outright purchased a Massey or an LS and wanted to resell it on my own and how little interest it drew and so a lot of that is really brand awareness and that's where John Deere and Kubota XL they they have a huge marketing budget and that obviously shows you can't go online or on tv without seeing their commercials and it looks great everybody wants those but people don't know about these smaller brands they don't know what to expect they don't know if they're going to be around a couple years from now or if they're just going to be like a walmart you know throw it in the garbage can after a couple years and call it good and move on and so what I found is that if I want to sell a comparable LS model to a similar used Kubota model I have to make that a huge price gap because otherwise if it's only a thousand bucks difference or two thousand dollar difference basically everybody's going to choose that Kubota model over the LS LS is going to sit there so that price gap needs to be gigantic in order to offer enough incentive for somebody to realize the savings are going to maybe outweigh the benefit of getting a bigger name brand but there's a big difference in depreciation all right everybody has to start out buying these tractors new whether you're buying it used or not somebody bought it new so that initial depreciation drop that I found historically on those value brand tractors is going to be somewhere in that 30 35 so like a third of the value just evaporates you compare that to a John Deere or Kubota and you're kind of in that traditional 15 percent ish maybe 10 maybe 20 somewhere around their depreciation hit and if we're talking about money I don't think of tractors as assets they are liabilities they are going to depreciate and so that difference in depreciation rate is pretty dramatic and so if you're paying on it right you're losing less money if you're paying on the Kubota than you are paying on the LS and so eventually that difference is going to kind of bottom out you know if you have a tractor that has a thousand hours on it it's not going down to five grand right there's a bottom unless your tractor is completely burnt out and beat up you're going to retain a certain amount of value and never hit zero so that depreciation gap starts pretty big right from the beginning and so you're going to retain more value with one of these bigger guys than you are with a value brand I've had quite a few occurrences of used tractors that I bought say what I've done a couple times it's like a 2008 2009 John Deere 3032e for example where that may have four five six hundred hours on it and within the last two or three years so maybe that tractor is 10 11 years old I sold it for the same amount that it sold for new 10 or 11 years ago but the market is changing the market's crazy right now prices are out of control they're all over the map it's hard to get new inventory and so that drives the price up of all the used equipment as well some of it is going for near new prices just because you can get your hands on it right away and so in my opinion I think that's going to continue for quite some time this is not going to stabilize I don't think for for years really and so that's going to really help out these value tractors on maintaining their value and making them more appealing you know so there's a lot to think about and these are big decisions for a lot of you guys and what I have found as well is that support from the community from the tractor world in general can go a long way traditional dealers are open from you know eight to five and a half day on Saturdays and sometimes you have a need or a problem or you don't have time to think about something going on with your tractor until it's after hours but you want to knock it out you want to work on it and so a tractor forum is a great place to get synced in with a community and the Kubota and John Deere's of the world has some really good forums there's just such a large volume of John Deere and Kubota owners out there that you can lean on their experience or if there is an issue that's happened to your tractor it may have happened to somebody else out there and already had a solution in mind and how to correct it if you're looking to do some modifications or some add-ons you know you're going to open your eyes to all the different things that other folks are doing to their tractors and it's not to say you can't get that somewhat with the value brands as well but the sheer quantity of owners that are out there is just it's not microscopic but it's substantially lower than the big two and so you're going to have to lean on more of the general community the general tractor forum just to kind of get some ideas on what to do but that intimate knowledge of the brand may be lacking you know and it's worth mentioning as well that we work with a lot of manufacturers that make aftermarket accessories just little bolt-on accessories and other grab panels and whatnot that are designed to work with the the existing holes the existing geometry of the John Deere and Kubota's of the world where there's just not enough volume out there potential volume for these manufacturers to put in the time and the effort and the engineering to create products for some of these other value brands maybe we'll get there at some point but it's going to be a ways down the road so yeah while for me i do focus primarily on the John Deere and the Kubota i do think there's a good strong case to be made for some of these value tractors again make your list make your checklist of what's important to you you know i mean some of those models i'd encourage you do your research out there and see if you are getting into a problem child now i always like to point out to any customer i get a lot of folks that reach out and ask me what tractor they should get and i always tell them if they're anywhere near this size machine to stay away from the Kubota b3350 it is a problem child you can read all about it you can spend days reading about the problems going on with that tractor but i say that to paint a clear picture that just because you see John Deere or Kubota right up front does not mean it's problem free you got to do your due diligence make sure you're buying a model that's known to be reliable that's going to
