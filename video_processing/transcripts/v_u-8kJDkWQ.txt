 What is the impact of the country in the world? Globally, there are almost 2.1 billion small ruminants. The first deputy ruminants are affecting 76 countries globally and more than 80% of the 2.1 billion small ruminants are in these 76 countries. We have to make sure that for infected countries, through the surveillance, we try to identify where the disease is. When we know where the disease is, we zoom the vaccination in that area to make sure that we reduce the incidence of the disease toward eradication. Then for the country neighboring the infected countries, we have to make sure that we undertake the surveillance or do the zone tampon buffer area where we will be doing the vaccination. And then for infected countries, we try to, for free countries, we try to assist them to be recognized free of the disease. Today, there are almost 53 countries who are already free of the disease. Now the program will be targeting the 76 countries and then other at-risk countries. And we hope that implementing the vaccine, the vaccination, surveillance, awareness, and partnership with all the stakeholders, we are able to eradicate the disease by 2030. The vaccine is cheaper. One dose of vaccine is less than 10 cents. To vaccinate one animal is less than 50 cents. The cost of one sheep and goat is around $100. You invest, you protect with half a dollar, but you gain $100 in healthy animals. But globally, we try to do the cost-benefic analysis. And when you invest $1, the return is 33.8, around $34. Therefore, the impact is really very high. But when the disease enters in one flock, almost 80% of the flock will die. Therefore, the impact. And in developing countries, small ruminants are the property of women. Therefore, it's really a major issue. If a mom loses 80 over 100 animals, she will not be able to sell the animals and to have meat, milk, wood, litter, and food. She will not have milk for children. Therefore, malnutrition. Therefore, the impact is really very high for developing countries. This is the reason why FAO and OIE decided to target that disease for eradication, for global eradication. We hope that we'll be able to achieve. The cost for the first phase, first five phases of the program is around $1 billion. But we think that with less than $3 billion, we are able to eradicate the disease. But the cost, the losses per year of this disease, due to this disease, has been estimated to be between $1.5 and $2 billion per year. But if we invest $3 billion, globally, we eradicate the disease.елейism on ground 1tech, the g Sy Paulo. $1 billion to help harm the disease thatión isabel. $3,2 billion and الز frenege.
