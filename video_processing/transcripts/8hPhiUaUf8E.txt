 Good afternoon folks. We have recently had some very cold weather here in Missouri and I wanted to give you an update on the greenhouse to let you know how it did. We got down to six degrees below zero outside and the greenhouse temperature got down to 16. I'm pretty tickled with those results. Of course that's a 22 degree difference in temperature and when it was six below it was blowing outside it was pretty nasty. We still kept 22 degrees warmer inside the greenhouse. Considering we have not had enough sun and warm days to actually get our heat sink charged, I'm pretty happy with those results. As always, thanks for watching. If you have any questions about the greenhouse or growing a mitt lighter garden, let me know.
