 Welcome to my channel. Today we are harvesting okra. Follow along and see the way we did it. As you will observe, you will realize that the okra is planted amidst other crops. It is a mixed cropping that we have. As you can observe it here, you see the okra, you see some very young corn. Likewise you see cassava in the form of a mixed cropping. So it is not only okra that is there, as you can see, yes, so it is mixed cropping. You see the bigger okra here and then some little corn, they are also there. So it is mixed cropping. So right now we want to do some harvesting of the okra. Follow along and watch to the end and see what we can also achieve apart from eating the okra fruits. okra fruits.
