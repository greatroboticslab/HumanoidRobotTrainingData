Three buttons there. I don't know what they do.
No, no, don't know.
No.
No.
Buttons here, don't know.
No.
And then... Oh, God, look.
There was only one thing for it.
Call my local branch of the National Farmers' Union and ask for help.
That would be perfect.
That's good. My union representative's coming over
to give me some help.
I'll go and light the brazier.
Instead of Arthur Scargill, however,
they sent Georgia Craig.
I'll be honest, I'm not the most practical man.
Are you good with tractors?
Yeah. But this is the only tractor you've got?
Well, yeah. Yeah.
OK. Well, what's wrong with it?
It's just a... It's quite big.
I mean, everyone keeps saying it's... Everyone says it's too big.
So, what made you choose it?
It's a Lamborghini. I'll get it done more quickly.
Right. OK.
So, what's the problem?
Honestly, truthfully,
I don't really know how the tractor works.
I can drive it, but I can't... But I can't operate it.
It's got three gear levers.
Yeah.
Two brake pedals and, I don't know, 8,000 buttons.
OK. Some of which are in German.
Lesson one was learning how to attach the tractor
to something called a cultivator.
Hold it, hold it there.
Argh!
Put a door couch there.
It's the last time I'm coming out of there forwards.
The first thing I've noticed is that pin is down.
So, you want to have both pins up.
Can I go in there?
I would turn the engine off and then pull the pin up,
just to be safe.
We're back up the ladder again.
Yeah.
Right, so...
Pull that pin up.
So, what we're going to do is lift the link arms up.
Right, so I'll start the engine.
Yep.
Back up the ladder.
Don't do that. Sit in it.
Right.
No, can I kick that one? It's just slight look.
No, no, no, don't kick it. Do it inside.
Back up the ladder.
How's it? Hold it there.
Can I operate it from in here and see if that's worked?
No, because they might come flying up.
Jesus.
OK, so you're nearly on.
You just need to come back a tiny little bit and then they'll go on.
Yeah, but it's literally a millimetre.
Yeah. You only need a little bit.
Back up the ladder again.
Fucking hell.
That's it.
Right, turn the engine off and then we'll do it from out here.
I'm going to operate it from in here. I don't care what she says.
Ha-ha!
No! Oh, shit.
Yes! I did it!
I just couldn't be bothered to come down the ladder again.
With the cultivator attached, we headed out to a nearby field so Georgia could teach me how to use it and what it did.
The idea is that we're just loosening the top, the sort of friable surface of the soil.
So we'd loosen it up now, jiggle it up a bit.
Yeah.
So when we put the seeds in using the driller, they're into good, loosened up soil.
Yeah.
And so began my first driving lesson for 42 years.
First gear?
Yeah.
Low?
Yeah.
Let's farm.
Look at that. I'm farming.
I'm doing it!
Look at the difference already. You can see where he's cultivated.
Right. Let's go a little bit faster, because we always want to get that soil to bubble up.
Speed up a bit.
And that soil is like boiling, isn't it? Like a soil boil.
It's amazing.
So before you turn, you're going to lift up, and then we're going to just do a three-point turn.
Let's do it.
Good turn.
Going down.
Do you like cruising in your Lambo?
Oh, come on. It's a pretty good tractor.
Too big.
Is it too big?
It is.
I was very much enjoying farming, so I decided to pull over and enjoy it some more.
With a ploughman's.
What cheese is this?
Cheddar.
Do you want to pick a lily?
Mm.
I think you're ready to go on your own.
Cultivating.
Really?
Yeah, because you'll get your own feel for it.
Flying solo on day one.
I'm actually doing farming.
It's not how I've...
It's what you wanted to do.
I've never... I know.
And Howard, the previous farmer, said, I'm jacking it in.
And I just thought, I'll do it.
And everybody said, you're stupid.
You're literally... That's the stupidest thing ever.
You'll never be able to do it.
And now you are.
I'm actually doing farming.
Look at that now.
That's beautiful, isn't it?
Perfect.
I like that tractor.
I like that tractor.
I shouldn't have been mean about it to start with.
No.
I was probably just jealous.
I like that�Так.
Yeah.
You're learning water.
