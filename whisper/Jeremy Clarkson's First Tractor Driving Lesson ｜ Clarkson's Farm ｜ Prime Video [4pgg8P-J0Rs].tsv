720	3040	Three buttons there. I don't know what they do.
3120	5120	No, no, don't know.
5680	6680	No.
7720	8720	No.
9200	10880	Buttons here, don't know.
11360	12360	No.
13160	15480	And then... Oh, God, look.
16880	19080	There was only one thing for it.
19160	23640	Call my local branch of the National Farmers' Union and ask for help.
23720	25400	That would be perfect.
25480	29480	That's good. My union representative's coming over
29480	31120	to give me some help.
32280	33880	I'll go and light the brazier.
36680	39000	Instead of Arthur Scargill, however,
40280	42200	they sent Georgia Craig.
43160	45920	I'll be honest, I'm not the most practical man.
46000	47400	Are you good with tractors?
47480	50320	Yeah. But this is the only tractor you've got?
50960	52360	Well, yeah. Yeah.
52920	54680	OK. Well, what's wrong with it?
54760	56600	It's just a... It's quite big.
56600	59600	I mean, everyone keeps saying it's... Everyone says it's too big.
59680	61280	So, what made you choose it?
61360	63720	It's a Lamborghini. I'll get it done more quickly.
63800	65000	Right. OK.
65080	66280	So, what's the problem?
66360	68400	Honestly, truthfully,
68480	71120	I don't really know how the tractor works.
71120	74520	I can drive it, but I can't... But I can't operate it.
74600	75960	It's got three gear levers.
76040	76640	Yeah.
76720	80840	Two brake pedals and, I don't know, 8,000 buttons.
81800	83200	OK. Some of which are in German.
85400	88120	Lesson one was learning how to attach the tractor
88120	90920	to something called a cultivator.
91840	92800	Hold it, hold it there.
95560	96760	Argh!
97720	99240	Put a door couch there.
100400	102440	It's the last time I'm coming out of there forwards.
102520	105080	The first thing I've noticed is that pin is down.
105160	106720	So, you want to have both pins up.
107120	108120	Can I go in there?
108200	110600	I would turn the engine off and then pull the pin up,
110680	111560	just to be safe.
111640	112760	We're back up the ladder again.
112840	113840	Yeah.
113840	117680	Right, so...
117760	118800	Pull that pin up.
121280	123480	So, what we're going to do is lift the link arms up.
123560	124920	Right, so I'll start the engine.
125000	126000	Yep.
126080	127080	Back up the ladder.
128080	129480	Don't do that. Sit in it.
137720	138720	Right.
138800	140720	No, can I kick that one? It's just slight look.
140800	143240	No, no, no, don't kick it. Do it inside.
143840	144720	Back up the ladder.
148360	149360	How's it? Hold it there.
150200	153160	Can I operate it from in here and see if that's worked?
153240	155520	No, because they might come flying up.
156600	157280	Jesus.
159920	161120	OK, so you're nearly on.
161200	163840	You just need to come back a tiny little bit and then they'll go on.
163920	165280	Yeah, but it's literally a millimetre.
165360	166800	Yeah. You only need a little bit.
166880	168120	Back up the ladder again.
170440	171160	Fucking hell.
171160	173040	That's it.
173120	175680	Right, turn the engine off and then we'll do it from out here.
177840	180000	I'm going to operate it from in here. I don't care what she says.
181840	182720	Ha-ha!
182800	183760	No! Oh, shit.
183840	185480	Yes! I did it!
185480	188240	I just couldn't be bothered to come down the ladder again.
191520	199600	With the cultivator attached, we headed out to a nearby field so Georgia could teach me how to use it and what it did.
199600	206160	The idea is that we're just loosening the top, the sort of friable surface of the soil.
206680	208920	So we'd loosen it up now, jiggle it up a bit.
208960	209120	Yeah.
209280	214280	So when we put the seeds in using the driller, they're into good, loosened up soil.
214400	214520	Yeah.
215320	220040	And so began my first driving lesson for 42 years.
220480	221160	First gear?
221560	221840	Yeah.
222080	222440	Low?
222780	223020	Yeah.
223020	225100	Let's farm.
234100	235540	Look at that. I'm farming.
236660	237860	I'm doing it!
241020	243720	Look at the difference already. You can see where he's cultivated.
243720	249560	Right. Let's go a little bit faster, because we always want to get that soil to bubble up.
250000	250840	Speed up a bit.
253960	256880	And that soil is like boiling, isn't it? Like a soil boil.
257880	258360	It's amazing.
262440	266320	So before you turn, you're going to lift up, and then we're going to just do a three-point turn.
267440	268000	Let's do it.
269400	270160	Good turn.
270160	275640	Going down.
278920	280560	Do you like cruising in your Lambo?
281240	282760	Oh, come on. It's a pretty good tractor.
283520	284180	Too big.
284500	285420	Is it too big?
285440	285840	It is.
287640	293880	I was very much enjoying farming, so I decided to pull over and enjoy it some more.
294560	296000	With a ploughman's.
296000	298640	What cheese is this?
298780	299100	Cheddar.
299960	300740	Do you want to pick a lily?
300920	301100	Mm.
304760	306040	I think you're ready to go on your own.
306840	307240	Cultivating.
307800	308200	Really?
308440	310460	Yeah, because you'll get your own feel for it.
311380	312800	Flying solo on day one.
313560	315160	I'm actually doing farming.
315960	316680	It's not how I've...
316680	317540	It's what you wanted to do.
317640	318460	I've never... I know.
318460	322900	And Howard, the previous farmer, said, I'm jacking it in.
322920	324940	And I just thought, I'll do it.
325580	327300	And everybody said, you're stupid.
328000	330000	You're literally... That's the stupidest thing ever.
330020	331280	You'll never be able to do it.
332080	332800	And now you are.
333100	334620	I'm actually doing farming.
338740	339760	Look at that now.
340840	341940	That's beautiful, isn't it?
341940	343580	Perfect.
345980	347100	I like that tractor.
347340	348460	I like that tractor.
348640	350400	I shouldn't have been mean about it to start with.
350540	350800	No.
351000	352220	I was probably just jealous.
352360	353340	I like that�Так.
365480	366060	Yeah.
370560	371080	You're learning water.
371080	372500	You're learning water.
374080	375180	You're learning water.
375360	376160	You're learning water.
376160	377180	You're learning water.
377720	378420	You're learning water.
378980	379100	You're learning water.
379660	380320	You're learning water.
381140	381600	You're learning water.
