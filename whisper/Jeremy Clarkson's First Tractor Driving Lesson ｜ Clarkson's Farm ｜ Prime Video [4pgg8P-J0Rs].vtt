00:00.720 --> 00:03.040
Three buttons there. I don't know what they do.

00:03.120 --> 00:05.120
No, no, don't know.

00:05.680 --> 00:06.680
No.

00:07.720 --> 00:08.720
No.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.880
Buttons here, don't know.

00:11.360 --> 00:12.360
No.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.480
And then... Oh, God, look.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.080
There was only one thing for it.

00:19.160 --> 00:23.640
Call my local branch of the National Farmers' Union and ask for help.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.400
That would be perfect.

00:25.480 --> 00:29.480
That's good. My union representative's coming over

00:29.480 --> 00:31.120
to give me some help.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.880
I'll go and light the brazier.

00:36.680 --> 00:39.000
Instead of Arthur Scargill, however,

00:40.280 --> 00:42.200
they sent Georgia Craig.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.920
I'll be honest, I'm not the most practical man.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.400
Are you good with tractors?

00:47.480 --> 00:50.320
Yeah. But this is the only tractor you've got?

00:50.960 --> 00:52.360
Well, yeah. Yeah.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.680
OK. Well, what's wrong with it?

00:54.760 --> 00:56.600
It's just a... It's quite big.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.600
I mean, everyone keeps saying it's... Everyone says it's too big.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.280
So, what made you choose it?

01:01.360 --> 01:03.720
It's a Lamborghini. I'll get it done more quickly.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.000
Right. OK.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.280
So, what's the problem?

01:06.360 --> 01:08.400
Honestly, truthfully,

01:08.480 --> 01:11.120
I don't really know how the tractor works.

01:11.120 --> 01:14.520
I can drive it, but I can't... But I can't operate it.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.960
It's got three gear levers.

01:16.040 --> 01:16.640
Yeah.

01:16.720 --> 01:20.840
Two brake pedals and, I don't know, 8,000 buttons.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.200
OK. Some of which are in German.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.120
Lesson one was learning how to attach the tractor

01:28.120 --> 01:30.920
to something called a cultivator.

01:31.840 --> 01:32.800
Hold it, hold it there.

01:35.560 --> 01:36.760
Argh!

01:37.720 --> 01:39.240
Put a door couch there.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.440
It's the last time I'm coming out of there forwards.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.080
The first thing I've noticed is that pin is down.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.720
So, you want to have both pins up.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.120
Can I go in there?

01:48.200 --> 01:50.600
I would turn the engine off and then pull the pin up,

01:50.680 --> 01:51.560
just to be safe.

01:51.640 --> 01:52.760
We're back up the ladder again.

01:52.840 --> 01:53.840
Yeah.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.680
Right, so...

01:57.760 --> 01:58.800
Pull that pin up.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.480
So, what we're going to do is lift the link arms up.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.920
Right, so I'll start the engine.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Yep.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.080
Back up the ladder.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.480
Don't do that. Sit in it.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.720
Right.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.720
No, can I kick that one? It's just slight look.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.240
No, no, no, don't kick it. Do it inside.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.720
Back up the ladder.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.360
How's it? Hold it there.

02:30.200 --> 02:33.160
Can I operate it from in here and see if that's worked?

02:33.240 --> 02:35.520
No, because they might come flying up.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.280
Jesus.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.120
OK, so you're nearly on.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.840
You just need to come back a tiny little bit and then they'll go on.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.280
Yeah, but it's literally a millimetre.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.800
Yeah. You only need a little bit.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.120
Back up the ladder again.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.160
Fucking hell.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.040
That's it.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.680
Right, turn the engine off and then we'll do it from out here.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.000
I'm going to operate it from in here. I don't care what she says.

03:01.840 --> 03:02.720
Ha-ha!

03:02.800 --> 03:03.760
No! Oh, shit.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.480
Yes! I did it!

03:05.480 --> 03:08.240
I just couldn't be bothered to come down the ladder again.

03:11.520 --> 03:19.600
With the cultivator attached, we headed out to a nearby field so Georgia could teach me how to use it and what it did.

03:19.600 --> 03:26.160
The idea is that we're just loosening the top, the sort of friable surface of the soil.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.920
So we'd loosen it up now, jiggle it up a bit.

03:28.960 --> 03:29.120
Yeah.

03:29.280 --> 03:34.280
So when we put the seeds in using the driller, they're into good, loosened up soil.

03:34.400 --> 03:34.520
Yeah.

03:35.320 --> 03:40.040
And so began my first driving lesson for 42 years.

03:40.480 --> 03:41.160
First gear?

03:41.560 --> 03:41.840
Yeah.

03:42.080 --> 03:42.440
Low?

03:42.780 --> 03:43.020
Yeah.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.100
Let's farm.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.540
Look at that. I'm farming.

03:56.660 --> 03:57.860
I'm doing it!

04:01.020 --> 04:03.720
Look at the difference already. You can see where he's cultivated.

04:03.720 --> 04:09.560
Right. Let's go a little bit faster, because we always want to get that soil to bubble up.

04:10.000 --> 04:10.840
Speed up a bit.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.880
And that soil is like boiling, isn't it? Like a soil boil.

04:17.880 --> 04:18.360
It's amazing.

04:22.440 --> 04:26.320
So before you turn, you're going to lift up, and then we're going to just do a three-point turn.

04:27.440 --> 04:28.000
Let's do it.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.160
Good turn.

04:30.160 --> 04:35.640
Going down.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.560
Do you like cruising in your Lambo?

04:41.240 --> 04:42.760
Oh, come on. It's a pretty good tractor.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.180
Too big.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.420
Is it too big?

04:45.440 --> 04:45.840
It is.

04:47.640 --> 04:53.880
I was very much enjoying farming, so I decided to pull over and enjoy it some more.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.000
With a ploughman's.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.640
What cheese is this?

04:58.780 --> 04:59.100
Cheddar.

04:59.960 --> 05:00.740
Do you want to pick a lily?

05:00.920 --> 05:01.100
Mm.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.040
I think you're ready to go on your own.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.240
Cultivating.

05:07.800 --> 05:08.200
Really?

05:08.440 --> 05:10.460
Yeah, because you'll get your own feel for it.

05:11.380 --> 05:12.800
Flying solo on day one.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.160
I'm actually doing farming.

05:15.960 --> 05:16.680
It's not how I've...

05:16.680 --> 05:17.540
It's what you wanted to do.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.460
I've never... I know.

05:18.460 --> 05:22.900
And Howard, the previous farmer, said, I'm jacking it in.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.940
And I just thought, I'll do it.

05:25.580 --> 05:27.300
And everybody said, you're stupid.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
You're literally... That's the stupidest thing ever.

05:30.020 --> 05:31.280
You'll never be able to do it.

05:32.080 --> 05:32.800
And now you are.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.620
I'm actually doing farming.

05:38.740 --> 05:39.760
Look at that now.

05:40.840 --> 05:41.940
That's beautiful, isn't it?

05:41.940 --> 05:43.580
Perfect.

05:45.980 --> 05:47.100
I like that tractor.

05:47.340 --> 05:48.460
I like that tractor.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.400
I shouldn't have been mean about it to start with.

05:50.540 --> 05:50.800
No.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.220
I was probably just jealous.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.340
I like that�Так.

06:05.480 --> 06:06.060
Yeah.

06:10.560 --> 06:11.080
You're learning water.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.500
You're learning water.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.180
You're learning water.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.160
You're learning water.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.180
You're learning water.

06:17.720 --> 06:18.420
You're learning water.

06:18.980 --> 06:19.100
You're learning water.

06:19.660 --> 06:20.320
You're learning water.

06:21.140 --> 06:21.600
You're learning water.
