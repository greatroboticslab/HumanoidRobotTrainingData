1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,040
Three buttons there. I don't know what they do.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,120
No, no, don't know.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,680
No.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,720
No.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,880
Buttons here, don't know.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
No.

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,480
And then... Oh, God, look.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,080
There was only one thing for it.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,640
Call my local branch of the National Farmers' Union and ask for help.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,400
That would be perfect.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,480
That's good. My union representative's coming over

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,120
to give me some help.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,880
I'll go and light the brazier.

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,000
Instead of Arthur Scargill, however,

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,200
they sent Georgia Craig.

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,920
I'll be honest, I'm not the most practical man.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,400
Are you good with tractors?

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,320
Yeah. But this is the only tractor you've got?

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,360
Well, yeah. Yeah.

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,680
OK. Well, what's wrong with it?

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,600
It's just a... It's quite big.

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,600
I mean, everyone keeps saying it's... Everyone says it's too big.

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,280
So, what made you choose it?

24
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,720
It's a Lamborghini. I'll get it done more quickly.

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,000
Right. OK.

26
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,280
So, what's the problem?

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,400
Honestly, truthfully,

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,120
I don't really know how the tractor works.

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,520
I can drive it, but I can't... But I can't operate it.

30
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,960
It's got three gear levers.

31
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,640
Yeah.

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,840
Two brake pedals and, I don't know, 8,000 buttons.

33
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,200
OK. Some of which are in German.

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,120
Lesson one was learning how to attach the tractor

35
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,920
to something called a cultivator.

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,800
Hold it, hold it there.

37
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,760
Argh!

38
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,240
Put a door couch there.

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,440
It's the last time I'm coming out of there forwards.

40
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,080
The first thing I've noticed is that pin is down.

41
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,720
So, you want to have both pins up.

42
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,120
Can I go in there?

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,600
I would turn the engine off and then pull the pin up,

44
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,560
just to be safe.

45
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,760
We're back up the ladder again.

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Yeah.

47
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,680
Right, so...

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,800
Pull that pin up.

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,480
So, what we're going to do is lift the link arms up.

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,920
Right, so I'll start the engine.

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yep.

52
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Back up the ladder.

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,480
Don't do that. Sit in it.

54
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
Right.

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,720
No, can I kick that one? It's just slight look.

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,240
No, no, no, don't kick it. Do it inside.

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,720
Back up the ladder.

58
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
How's it? Hold it there.

59
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,160
Can I operate it from in here and see if that's worked?

60
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,520
No, because they might come flying up.

61
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,280
Jesus.

62
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,120
OK, so you're nearly on.

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,840
You just need to come back a tiny little bit and then they'll go on.

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,280
Yeah, but it's literally a millimetre.

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
Yeah. You only need a little bit.

66
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,120
Back up the ladder again.

67
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,160
Fucking hell.

68
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,040
That's it.

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,680
Right, turn the engine off and then we'll do it from out here.

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to operate it from in here. I don't care what she says.

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,720
Ha-ha!

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,760
No! Oh, shit.

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,480
Yes! I did it!

74
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,240
I just couldn't be bothered to come down the ladder again.

75
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:19,600
With the cultivator attached, we headed out to a nearby field so Georgia could teach me how to use it and what it did.

76
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:26,160
The idea is that we're just loosening the top, the sort of friable surface of the soil.

77
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,920
So we'd loosen it up now, jiggle it up a bit.

78
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,120
Yeah.

79
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,280
So when we put the seeds in using the driller, they're into good, loosened up soil.

80
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,520
Yeah.

81
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,040
And so began my first driving lesson for 42 years.

82
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,160
First gear?

83
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:41,840
Yeah.

84
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,440
Low?

85
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,020
Yeah.

86
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,100
Let's farm.

87
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,540
Look at that. I'm farming.

88
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,860
I'm doing it!

89
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,720
Look at the difference already. You can see where he's cultivated.

90
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,560
Right. Let's go a little bit faster, because we always want to get that soil to bubble up.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
Speed up a bit.

92
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,880
And that soil is like boiling, isn't it? Like a soil boil.

93
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,360
It's amazing.

94
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,320
So before you turn, you're going to lift up, and then we're going to just do a three-point turn.

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's do it.

96
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,160
Good turn.

97
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,640
Going down.

98
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,560
Do you like cruising in your Lambo?

99
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,760
Oh, come on. It's a pretty good tractor.

100
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,180
Too big.

101
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,420
Is it too big?

102
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:45,840
It is.

103
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,880
I was very much enjoying farming, so I decided to pull over and enjoy it some more.

104
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
With a ploughman's.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,640
What cheese is this?

106
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,100
Cheddar.

107
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,740
Do you want to pick a lily?

108
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,100
Mm.

109
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,040
I think you're ready to go on your own.

110
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,240
Cultivating.

111
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,200
Really?

112
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,460
Yeah, because you'll get your own feel for it.

113
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,800
Flying solo on day one.

114
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,160
I'm actually doing farming.

115
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,680
It's not how I've...

116
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,540
It's what you wanted to do.

117
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,460
I've never... I know.

118
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,900
And Howard, the previous farmer, said, I'm jacking it in.

119
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,940
And I just thought, I'll do it.

120
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,300
And everybody said, you're stupid.

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're literally... That's the stupidest thing ever.

122
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,280
You'll never be able to do it.

123
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,800
And now you are.

124
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,620
I'm actually doing farming.

125
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,760
Look at that now.

126
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,940
That's beautiful, isn't it?

127
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,580
Perfect.

128
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,100
I like that tractor.

129
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,460
I like that tractor.

130
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,400
I shouldn't have been mean about it to start with.

131
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:50,800
No.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,220
I was probably just jealous.

133
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,340
I like that�Так.

134
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,060
Yeah.

135
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,080
You're learning water.

136
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,500
You're learning water.

137
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,180
You're learning water.

138
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,160
You're learning water.

139
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,180
You're learning water.

140
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,420
You're learning water.

141
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,100
You're learning water.

142
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,320
You're learning water.

143
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,600
You're learning water.
